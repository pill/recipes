2022-07-19,18,"Cucumber Kimchi","mienczaczek","As cucumbers are in season their abundance and lower price is a perfect time to prepare Cucumber Kimchi. It is a delicious addition to many Asian dishes, perfect for a hot sunny day. Great booster for your gut microbiome as well :)

I recommend you try Vaccum packing for your fermented products as it can save you space and create an anaerobic environment that prevents the development of unwanted pathogens. Here you can find the device and the bags at a good price.

**Ingredients:**

\* 700g of cucumbers (pickling variety)

\* 14g of salt (2% per cucumber weight)

\* 1 medium-sized carrot cut into 5cm julienne

\* a handful of chives

\* 3tbsp of Gochugaru (Korean chilli flakes)

\* 1,5tbsp of minced garlic

\* 2tsp of minced ginger

\* half of the red apple, grated

\* 1,5tbsp of sugar

\* 1tsp of minced Saeujeot (Korean salted shrimp)(use more fish sauce if not available)

\* 1tsp of fish sauce (Use dark soy sauce for vegetarian version)

**Instructions:**

1. Prepare cucumbers by removing their ends, then cut them in half lengthways. Now divide into 5cm parts and cut each part 3 times at an angle. Place in the large bowl with julienned carrots and chives then mix in the salt. Rest for 25 minutes.
2. In the meantime prepare Gochugaru paste by mixing all the remaining ingredients in a separate bowl.
3. Once cucumbers are ready combine them with paste.
4. Transfer everything into a jar or a vacuum bag and seal. Leave at room temperature for 2-3 days then move into the fridge. (Once the bags start to inflate)
5. Kimchi will develop more flavour over time so experiment with the fermentation time to suit your taste.

Servings: 6 | Cook Time: 45 Minutes

**Ingredients for the Meatballs**

* ¼  cup grated parmesan
* 4 cloves minced garlic
* 1 tablespoon lemon zest
* ¾  cup panko breadcrumbs
* 1 large egg
* S  cup chopped parsley (plus more)
* 1 ¼  pounds ground chicken (or turkey)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper

**Ingredients for the Sauce and Pasta**

* 4 tablespoons cold butter, cubed
* 3 cloves minced garlic
* 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour (scant)
* 1 ½  cups low sodium chicken broth
* ¼  cup capers (plus 2 tsp caper brine)
* ¼  cup fresh lemon juice
* 1 lb box of Pappardelle or pasta of your choice

**Ingredients for the Basil Oil**

* ¼ cup olive oil
* ½ cup tightly packed sweet basil leaves

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 400 F and set oven rack in the middle.
2. Make the meatballs: Add all meatballs ingredients besides the ground chicken to a large mixing bowl and stir thoroughly. Add the chicken and mix with hands until just combined  you dont want to overwork the chicken. Roll into 20-22 meatballs, size should be slightly smaller than a golf ball. Place meatballs on lined baking sheet and put in heated oven for 15 minutes, flipping the meatballs after 8 minutes.
3. Make the basil oil: Bring a medium-sized pot of well-salted water to a boil and have a bowl of ice water ready. Blanch the basil leaves for roughly ten seconds to set their color. Remove quickly from the boiling water and dunk into the ice water. Remove from water and squeeze gently to remove excess water. Add the basil, oil, and a small pinch of salt to the bowl of a small blender and blend until the mixture is pureed. Let sit for 15 minutes, and then strain through a fine-strainer, gently pushing the solids to extract the oil. Set aside for later use.
4. Make the pasta: Using the same pot of boiling water, put your pasta in. Cook for 7-8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain in colander and toss with splash of olive oil so that pasta doesnt stick together.
5. Make the sauce: Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add 1 tablespoon of butter to the skillet along with the garlic and cook for 30 seconds or until fragrant. Add the flour and whisk continuously. After 30 seconds, slowly drizzle in the chicken broth with one hand while you continue to whisk with the other hand. Add the caper brine, capers, lemon juice, and allow the sauce to gain a simmer. Then add the meatballs and reduce the heat to medium, letting the sauce thicken for 5-7 minutes. Lower the heat to low, add the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter and allow them to slowly melt into the sauce as you stir.
6. Assemble: Put a helping of the Pappardelle or pasta of your choice on a plate, then top with 3-4 meatballs. Spoon some of the sauce over the meatballs and pasta, then drizzle a small amount of basil oil over top as well. Garnish with parsley and extra grated parmesan, if desired.",3073

Its summer and heat outside, and you want some cold, but at the same time hearty dish.

Now I want to present you a recipe based on the recipes of Korean cuisine. As usual with my cooking options.

By the way, this dish can be served hot, or you can simply put all the ingredients on a plate and lightly sprinkle with broth. In general, as you like. Lets start. [(The original recipe and many other recipes)](https://grillmangal.art/en/cold-noodle-dish-in-korean-style/)

**Ingredients (for 6 servings)**

* Chicken breast  700 g
* Noodles (wheat)  350 g
* Water  1.5 l
* Tomatoes  1 pc (230 g)
* Cucumbers  2 pcs (380 g)
* Garlic  5 cloves
* Soy sauce  5 tablespoons
* Red ground pepper  1 tsp
* Vinegar 9%  5 tsp
* Salt  2.5 tsp (17 g)
* Sugar  2.5 tbsp. (50 g)
* Eggs  4 pcs (60-65 g each)
* Sunflower oil  3 tbsp.

**Lets start cooking**

1. First, lets take a look at the chicken breast. We will remove the excess  films, fat. And cut into small strips. It can also be in pieces, the main thing is that it is not thicker than 1 cm, and then it is convenient to eat.
2. Place the chopped chicken in a container, pour in a tablespoon of soy sauce and a tablespoon of sunflower oil, mix, cover with a film and let it stand warm for about 30 minutes, while we will deal with other ingredients.
3. Cut the cucumbers into strips, put them in another container, add a pinch of salt, mix and also leave warm.
4. Its time to start the broth. Pour cold boiled water (1.5 l) into the pan, add sugar (2.5 tbsp), salt (2.5 tsp), 5 teaspoons of vinegar, soy sauce (4 tbsp), set saucepan over low heat and heat slightly, stirring occasionally. Do not bring to a boil. Once the salt and sugar have dissolved, remove the pan from the heat. Let cool to room temperature.
5. Crush 3 cloves of garlic and add to the broth
6. Cut the tomato into cubes and also add to the broth
7. The broth is ready. Someone prefers to cool it in the refrigerator, I am not a supporter of too cold broth, room temperature is enough.
8. Drain the excess liquid from the cucumbers, and let them stand further.
9. Heat the pan, add 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil and put the chicken breast here. Fry for no more than 2-3 minutes and add here 1 teaspoon of red ground pepper and 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic. Cook for a couple more minutes and turn off. Put the breast in a separate container, and pour the cucumbers with the resulting sauce in the pan.
10. Make 2 omelettes (two eggs each). Put them on a plate and let them cool. Once cool, cut them into small strips. (I usually roll it into a tube and then cut it, its convenient)
11. Well, the noodles remained. Someone makes it at the very beginning, but this is not important  thin noodles cool down instantly. We cook the noodles as stated on the package (mine is cooked for 3-4 minutes).
12. Here are all the ingredients we have prepared. It remains only to connect them.
13. You can serve all the ingredients on one large dish, and everyone takes what they want and pours as much broth as they like. Some people eat it like a paste  putting all the ingredients on a flat plate and lightly pouring the broth.
14. Order of serving. We put the noodles in a cup, put the chicken on top, next to the tomatoes, omelette strips and cucumbers. Pour in broth, quantity as desired.

Thats all!

2022-07-11,12,"Homemade Filipino Mango Float","filipinocookinggirl","This a Filipino icebox cake dessert made with layers of ladyfingers or graham crackers, whipped cream, condensed milk, and ripe carabao mangoes. It is chilled for a few hours before serving. This dessert is delicious yet easy to make.

My mom would make this for special occasions such as Christmas and Birthdays.

The mangoes bring freshness to this sweet dessert. I must admit it's my favorite Filipino dessert.

[Step-by-step video instruction](https://youtu.be/o_385-41uKA)

**Ingredients**  


* Two cups heavy cream chilled
* Four tablespoons condensed milk
* One pack graham crackers
* Two pieces mangoes sliced and cubed
* One cup milk

**Recipe steps**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pour the whipping cream into a medium-sized bowl
2. Use a handheld electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment
3. Whip the cream on medium speed for about five minutes
4. Gradually pour the condensed milk while mixing
5. Add more until you get the desired sweetness 
6. Mix until well-combined
7. Pour the milk into a bowl
8. Dip each graham in the milk, then place them into a rectangle-shaped glass dish. I use a ten-inch dish for this recipe
9. Place enough graham crackers to form the first layer at the bottom of the dish
10. Next, evenly spread a cup of whipping cream on the top of your graham crackers
11. Then, put a layer of diced mangoes on top of the cream
12. Repeat by covering the mangoes with graham crackers. It's ok to cut the crackers to fit 
13. Then cover with another layer of cream and top with more mangoes
14. Flatten the layers
15. Add one more layer of graham and cover with cream
16. I like to add crushed Grahams for a final touch
17. Cover with plastic wrap

**Ingredients**

***European Sponge Cake***

* 6 Eggs Room temperature
* 6 tbsp Water Room temperature
* 1.5 cup Granulated Sugar
* 1 cup All-purpose Flour
* 1/2 cup Cornstarch
* pinch of salt

***Luscious Lemon Curd***

* 4 Egg yolks large
* 2/3 cup Granulated Sugar
* 1/3 cup Lemon Juice
* 4 tbsp Unsalted butter cold, cut into small pieces (rough estimate)
* pinch of salt

***Simple Vanilla Cream (Crème Diplomat)***

* 2 cups Milk I recommend 2% or higher m.f.
* 2 tsp Vanilla extract
* 4 Egg yolks large
* 1/2 cup Granulated Sugar
* 3 tbsp Corn Starch
* 3 tbsp Vanilla pudding mix/Vanilla Corn starch
* 2 tbsp Unsalted Butter
* pinch of salt
* 1 cup Heavy Cream
* 1/4 cup Powdered Sugar

**Instructions**

***European Sponge Cake***

1. Preheat oven to 350F (Convection 325F).Line 3 x 9 cake pans. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat eggs with water and sugar on high-speed for \~10 minutes, until light in colour and tripled in volume. Fold flour, starch and salt into the egg mixture. Split batter into 3, bake for \~30 minutes at 350F (a toothpick inserted into the centre will come out clean and the top will be golden). Once baked, remove cakes from the oven and allow to cool in pan for \~5 min before transferring to a wire rack. Remove parchment paper from each cake and set aside until assembly.

**Simple Lemon Curd**

1. In a medium saucepan, over low heat, combine lemon juice, sugar, and egg yolks. Whisk mixture over low heat frequently as it heats (low or medium-low depending on how quickly your stove heats). You will notice that the mixture begins to feel thicker  continue whisking! After about 7-8 minutes, the curd mixture will begin to leave a trail when lifted. Add butter and whisk until fully melted. Add pinch of salt and whisk one final time.
2. Transfer the hot lemon curd to a bowl/jar and cover to prevent film from forming (optional: you can strain the lemon curd to remove any residual fragments for an even smoother consistency!). Cool completely at room temperature and then store in the fridge for up to 3 weeks or freeze in airtight freezer bag for up to 6 months.

**Simple &amp; Light Vanilla Cream (Creme Diplomat)**

1. In a saucepan, heat milk and vanilla extract on medium heat. Bring to a gentle boil. Meanwhile, whisk sugar, egg yolks, cornstarch, and vanilla custard/pudding mix in a small mixing bowl. Whisk until mixture is creamy, pale, and smooth. Slowly pour half of the boiled milk into the mixing bowl with the eggs. Reduce to low heat. Transfer mixing bowl contents into the saucepan with the remaining half of the boiled milk. Continue to heat mixture on medium-low heat until thickened. Remove from heat. Add butter and whisk until melted. Add a pinch of salt. Remove custard from heat. 
2. Once custard is thickened and cooled, whip heavy cream with icing sugar in a medium/large mixing bowl. When ready, whipped cream will have formed stiff peaks that leave a trail when electric mixer is removed. \*\*This step can happen really fast so be sure to keep a close eye on the cream! Remove the whipped cream from the bowl and temporarily set aside.
3. Add all of your pastry cream to the large bowl and gently fold in half of the sweetened whipped cream. \*\*this can be done by using a spatula to repeatedly divide the pastry cream into halves while incorporating the whipped cream. If you continue doing this gently, the mixture will begin to resemble a uniform, light cream. Set aside.

**Assembly**

1. Remove sponge cake from cake pans by running knife around the sides of the pans and inverting sponge cakes onto clean surface. Remove parchment paper.
2. Repeat with second and third sponge cake.
3. On top of 1st layer of sponge cake  add crème diplomat to cover. Pipe crème diplomat around the edge of the sponge. Add thin layer of lemon curd to the centre of crème diplomat ring.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 with the second cake layer. Top with third and final cake layer.
5. Once assembled, cover cake with remaining crème diplomat.
6. Decorate with piped crème diplomat and lemon curd as desired.

2022-07-07,34,"Gooey Chocolate Brownies","croissantbbyy","Ive been trying out different brownie recipes to get a really nice, not overly sweet, gooey brownie. 
After many attempts, from a tiny cookbook my grandma gave me, to BBC Good Food, and even this subreddit, I have found the perfect one (so you guys dont have to).

[link to recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-fudgy-homemade-brownies)

**Ingredients**

- 1/2 cup (115g) salted or unsalted butter

- two 4-ounce (226g) semi-sweet chocolate bars, coarsely chopped

- 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar

- 1/4 cup (50g) packed light or dark brown sugar

- 3 eggs 

- 1/2 cup + 2 Tablespoons (79g) all-purpose flour (spoon &amp; leveled)

- 2 Tablespoons (10g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder

- 1/4 teaspoon salt

**Important to note**

I didnt add vanilla extract OR chocolate chips because i didnt have any, but the recipe says you can! I also used the grams measurement.

**Directions**

1. Measure your butter and chocolate out in a big bowl, then stick it on top of a saucepan with water (also known as a bain-marie) to melt it. Then, let the mixture cool, otherwise youll cook the egg.

2. Once mixture is cool, whisk in (I used a stand-mixer, but a good old handheld metal one will be fine, youll just end up super hench) the sugar and eggs. 

3. Make sure to use a sieve to sift in your salt, cocoa powder and flour. Then use a spatula to fold in the dry ingredients, dont whisk!

4. Add your mixture to a lined tray (I line mine with baking powder, I dont like just greasing it) and evenly spread out the mixture you have managed not to eat.

5. Bake in the oven at 180 degrees celsius (pls google the F equivalent) for about 25 minutes, after 20 I usually stick a butter knife in. You want your knife to come out with bits of crumbs and goo, but not too much. You **DONT** want the knife to be clean.

6. Leave to cool (I dont have a cooling rack to I put about an inch and a half of cold water into my sink and put the tray in there so it was half submerged). 

Theyre nice to eat warm, cold etc. Just dont store them in the fridge, otherwise theyll go hard and weird.

**Time: \~30 mins**

**Servings: 4**

**Original Recipe link:** [https://craftycookbook.com/tangy-dijon-penne-with-charred-kielbasa/](https://craftycookbook.com/tangy-dijon-penne-with-charred-kielbasa/) (this has more info, tips, and pictures)

This dish is the epitome of comfort food, but with some twists to make it lighter! It's almost like the grown-up version of putting sliced hot dogs in your mac-n-cheese. The sauce is lighter than you'd expect since it's made with Greek yogurt. This dish certainly isn't light overall, but the Greek yogurt sauce is much lower calorie than a traditional cream and butter based sauce, making this recipe something I'm happy to make a little more often. I almost always make this dish with turkey kielbasa, which has about half the calories and fat of classic kielbasa.

When this dish is made with turkey kielbasa there are around 550 calories per serving.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients**

* 12-14 oz kielbasa, thinly sliced
* 8 oz penne pasta, or similar
* ½ cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt, 1 single serve container
* ¾ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided (canned parm may have problems melting into the sauce, use fresh if possible)
* 1 cup chicken stock
* 2 tbsp cornstarch
* 2-3 tbsp coarse ground Dijon mustard, I use Grey Poupon Country Dijon
* ½ tbsp freshly minced garlic
* salt
* fresh cracked black pepper
* olive oil

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions**

1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package directions while completing the other steps. Drain and keep warm.
2. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Add the sliced kielbasa and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to brown and crisp, a few minutes per side. Remove from the pan to a paper towel lined plate, dont wipe the pan clean.
3. Add another 2 tsp of olive oil to the pan and reduce the heat slightly. Add the cornstarch and whisk together until fully combined (about a minute). Slowly add in the chicken stock, mixing well as you go to form a roux.
4. Let the chicken stock mixture come to a simmer, then slowly whisk in the yogurt a few tablespoons at a time. Once combined and simmering again add the garlic, ½ cup of the parmesan, and the dijon (2 tbsp  3 tbsp, adjust to taste based on how strong your dijon is and how strong you want it to be in the sauce  I use 3 tbsp).
5. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Reduce heat to low until ready to use.

Add the pasta to the skillet with the sauce and toss until its fully coated. Top with the sliced kielbasa, gently folding it into the pasta, then top with the remaining ¼ cup of Parmesan. Remove from heat. 6. Optional  Place the dish under the broiler in your oven for 2-3 minutes, watching closely to make sure nothing burns. Make sure your skillet is oven-safe for this step! This melts the cheese and gets the top a little crispy. Serve immediately.

* ¾ lb 85% lean ground beef
* ¾ lb ground pork

**Ingredients for the Sauce**

* ¼ cup soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons fish sauce
* ¼ cup lime juice, from 2 to 3 limes
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 2 tablespoons Asian Chili Sauce, such as Sambal Oelek

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 400°F and set an oven rack in middle position.
2. In a large bowl, combine the eggs, fish sauce, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, scallions, lime zest, cilantro, and mint. Whisk to combine. Add the beef, pork, and panko.

The mixture will be sticky, so dampen your hands every so often while rolling the meatballs if necessary. Bake for 25 minutes, flipping once with a metal spatula halfway through the cooking time, until the meatballs are browned and cooked through.
3. Make the sauce by whisking all of the ingredients together in a medium bowl. Be sure the sugar is completely dissolved and not stuck to the bottom of the bowl. Taste and add more chili sauce if desired.

125g butter is about 1/2 stick (a little more) so I would do 1/2

75g castor (very fine sugar) is .39 cups. Use a measurement that works for you. Do you like your cookies sweeter? Go up to a shy 1/2 cup. Salty sweet? Do 1/3. Also, use the sugar you have, or my preference all brown sugar (don't have brown sugar or don't want to keep 2 types? Add molasses to make brown sugar). Sugar adds moisture to recipes 

75g of brown sugar is .35 cups, go with 1/3

175g of all-purpose flour is 1.46 cups (try 1.5 cups and adjust. Measuring flour in cups will give you a lot of uncontrolled variability. My preferred method for measuring by volume is to fluff the flour first with a spoon (it settles and compacts with time) and the scoop into the measuring cup with a spoon ensuring it stays as fluffy as possible. Don't bang the measuring cup, take a knife and knock off anything above the top by sliding it across.

2022-07-04,17,"Gazpacho for a hot summer day","BasilGreenEyes","The traditional recipe does not have cilantro at all, and has green ""Italian"" peppers, normally (although that is debatable), no onion or if it's there a small ""white"" onion. This take on the dish has maybe too much garlic, too much cucumber, and it seems not blended enough (and the tomatoes are not matured/ red enough).

That being said, you can make it however you want and your taste is. There are people that add water to make it more like a drink, some add bread to their liking, etc.

The traditional recipe is 1 kg of matured tomatoes, 1 green Italian pepper, 1 or 2 cloves of garlic, 1 or half small cucumber, 50ml olive oil ( or to consistency), 50 g of bread ( if you want), 5g salt, 20/30 ml vinegar ( to taste), 250 ml of water ( if you want and to consistency). All blended to the maximum and then strained. You can peel the fruits and vegetables before if you want. But if you strain them is not necessary.

For ""garnish"" you can put small diced tomatoes and/or cucumber and/or peppers, but it can be served in a glass like a ""juice"". Salmorejo is another recipe really similar but more in the ""soup category"" ( that you eat with a spoon and it's more thick).

#### For serving:

### Instructions

#### Make the meatballs:

* Mix together the egg and milk until smooth. Add the panko and stir to combine. Let stand 5 minutes. Add the turkey and all the spices. Mix together with your hands until combined. If the mixture is too loose, add more panko in 1/4 cup increments. The mixture should be sticky, but rollable.
* Tip: Microwave or fry up a small piece of the mixture and taste a bit and then adjust the seasonings before rolling the meatballs.
* Roll the meatballs into tablespoon-sized balls.
* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a deep skillet. Add the meatballs in an even layer and fry for 23 minutes per side. Continue turning until browned all over. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover loosely with foil, and simmer for 1520 minutes or until cooked through. Once the meatballs are cooked through, turn off the heat and keep warm.

#### Prepare the saffron rice:

* Place the basmati rice in a sieve and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear.
* Place half a pinch of saffron in a bowl and use the back of a spoon to crush it. Add the remaining threads, leaving them whole, and pour 1/4 cup hot water (it can be hot water from your tap!) over the saffron. Let stand for 5 minutes.
* Place a large pot on the stove over medium-high heat. Add the butter. Once melted, add the diced onion and cook until translucent. Add the rinsed rice and cook 12 minutes. Pour the saffron-water mixture on top and then add the remaining water. Season it with salt and then bring to a low boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes or until the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and let the rice rest for 510 minutes.

#### Prepare the zucchini-cucumber salad:

* Add the diced zucchini, cucumber, and shallot to a bowl. Add extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and dry dill. Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.

#### Prepare the hummus sauce:

* Whisk together the hummus, lemon juice, and chili flakes until smooth. Taste and add salt if needed. Add a few splashes of water until the hummus reaches drizzling consistency. Set aside.

#### To serve:

* Divide the rice between bowls. Pile the meatballs on top and add a spoonful of salad to each bowl. Serve with a spoonful of the hummus sauce and toasted pita, if you like. Enjoy!

2022-07-03,3,"Beef Madras Curry","mienczaczek","Who doesn't like super tender beef in rich tomato-based curry sauce? It melts in the mouth and is super easy to prepare! I have separated the process of cooking as most online recipes call for, this gives more control over meat tenderness and the right consistency of the sauce, just like in the restaurant setting, bringing the best quality to your home cooking :)

**Ingredients for Marinade:**

\* 500g (1.1Pound) Beef chuck steak diced to 2,5cm cubes (you can use any braising cut if chuck is not available)

\* 1tbsp of ginger &amp; garlic paste

\* 1tbsp vegetable oil

\* 1tsp of salt

\* 1 lemon juice

\* 3tbsp of Madras spice blend

**Ingredients for Madras Spice Blend:**

\* 3tbsp ground coriander

\* 3tbsp ground cumin

\* 2tbsp ground turmeric

\* 2tbsp chilli powder (adjust to your preference)

\* 2tbsp garam masala

\* 1tsp black pepper

**Ingredients for the Curry:**

\* 500g of marinated Beef

\* enough water to cover the meat during slow-cooking

\* 2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil

\* 1 large onion, small dice

\* 1tbsp of garlic &amp; ginger paste

\* 3tbsp of Madras spice blend

\* 400ml of vegetable stock

\* 4tbsp of tomato puree

\* juice of a half lemon

\* 1tsp of sugar

\* 1 beef stock cube

\* a handful of fresh coriander leaves and seeds

\* papadam to serve

**Instructions:**

1. Prepare the Madras spice blend by mixing the ingredients. It will make more than you need for the recipe (you can always add more at the end of cooking to boost the flavour)
2. Place the beef in the bowl and marinate by mixing all the ingredients from the list with the meat. Place in the fridge overnight.
3. On the following day, sear the beef in a frying pan over high heat and transfer it to a slow-cooker or a pot (do not over-fry it as it will make your meat dry, you want a nice caramelization on one side of each piece) Add enough hot water to cover the meat and cook covered on low until tender. This can take 2-3 hours depending on the cut used (a slow-cooker can take longer).
4. In the meantime prepare the sauce. In a medium-sized pan heat 2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil, add diced onion and fry over medium heat until soft and browned.
5. Add 1tbsp of garlic ginger paste, 3tbsp of Madras spice blend and cook until fragrant.
6. Add vegetable stock, tomato puree, beef stock cube, 1tsp of sugar and lemon juice. Mix together and bring to a boil. Blend sauce and adjust seasoning to your preference, remove from the heat until needed.
7. Once the beef is tender and connective tissue has turned into jelly, separate it from the liquid. Add beef to the sauce plus a little bit of the cooking stock.
8. Continue cooking on low heat until the thick consistency of the sauce is reached.
9. Serve Beef Madras with fresh coriander seeds and leaves. Crunch with papadam, cucumber raita and onion salad. Enjoy!

**Insight:**

\- The slow cooker's low setting is approximately 90C (194F). A high setting brings the cooking temperature to around 100C (212F).

\- Collagen - connective tissue in the meat begins to dissolve into gelatin at a temperature of 70C (160F). Lower cooking temperatures and longer time result in a juicer and tenderer meat.

So I decided to share my recipe for borscht, I make it my own way, but I took several recipes for the popular Ukrainian soup as a basis. And yes, I make it a little thinner than in classic recipes  children prefer it that way. [Original recipe and some tips](https://grillmangal.art/en/borscht-with-pork-and-white-beans/)  
  
I happened to live and work in Kyiv for 6 months, and since then it has been one of my favorite cities. Beautiful city, nice people.   
   
In this article there will be a recipe for borscht, rolls and garlic impregnation. It is a homemade version of the recipe, so feel free to call your friends, you will get at least 10 servings. So lets go:

**Ingredients (borscht)**

* Pork on the bone  600 g
* Water  5 liters (+2-3 liters for the first broth)
* Potato  300 g
* Cabbage  300 g
* Beets  200 g
* Carrots  100 g

* Sunflower oil  2 tbsp.
* Vinegar  6%  1 tsp
* Salt  1 tbsp.
* Onion  1 pc (120-130 g)

**Ingredients (rolls)**

* Wheat flour  320 g
* Water (or milk)  200 ml
* Sugar  1 tbsp
* Dry yeast  10 g
* Yolk  2 pcs (1 for dough, 1 for brashing rolls)
* Salt  1/2 tsp
* Butter  35 g

**Ingredients (garlic sauce for rolls)**

* Garlic  3-4 cloves
* Sunflower oil  2 tbsp
* Salt  1/2 tsp
* Water  50-70 ml

**Lets start cooking**

1. The first thing I do is a dough. Dissolve dry yeast in 100 ml of warm water, add sugar and 50 grams of flour. Cover with clingfilm or lid and leave for 20 minutes.
2. After 20 minutes, the dough will increase in volume
3. Add yolk, salt to the dough, mix
4. Add the rest of the flour in parts and mix until smooth, the dough is slightly sticky. Thats the way it should be. Mix it until smooth. Add butter, mix again.
5. Cover the resulting dough with cling film or a lid and put it in a warm place for an hour and a half.
6. Now lets do borscht. We place the meat in a large stockpot and pour 2-3 liters of water. We put on maximum heat
7. Skim regularly
8. As soon as the water boils, reduce the heat to medium, let it cook for 15-20 minutes
9. Do not forget to skim regularly
10. After 15-20 minutes, we take out the meat, rinse with cold water, and also rinse the stockpot.
11. Place the meat in a stockpot again, pour 5-6 liters of cold water and put it on a high heat again.
12. As it boils, reduce the heat, and let it boil, do not forget to remove the scale.
13. After an hour, put washed, but not peeled, onions into the broth. It is needed with the husk, it gives a golden color to the broth.
14. Salt the broth and let it cook for another 30 minutes. As a result, the broth is cooked for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
15. After an hour and a half, we take out the onion and throw it away, we no longer need it, he has already given everything he can to the broth.
16. We take out the meat and cut it into small pieces so that it is more convenient to eat them later.
17. Throw diced potatoes into the broth, after 10 minutes add chopped cabbage to it.
18. Finely grate carrots and beets.
19. Pour a couple of tablespoons of sunflower oil into the frying pan and spread the carrots and beets. Fry until soft, add a teaspoon of vinegar, mix. And add here 50 ml of the resulting broth from the stockpot. Cover the pan with a lid and simmer for 20 minutes over low heat.
20. After 20 minutes, add the beets and carrots to the pan where the potatoes and cabbage are already cooked. Mix. And add beans along with tomato sauce. (Yes, I took canned, to save time, otherwise you could cook it yourself)
21. Add chopped meat here. And let it cook for another 10 minutes, so that the meat is saturated with all the flavors. !heck the amount of salt in the broth.
22. If everything is OK, then turn it off, cover it with a lid and let it stay.
23. Now back to the rolls.
24. The dough in 1 hour 30 minutes should already have increased in volume three times.
25. Gently knead the dough. Put it on a surface sprinkled with flour, knead it a little and divide it into 10 identical parts. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
26. Cover the balls with a film or towel and let stand for 20-25 minutes, but for now preheat the oven to 180°C (356°F).
27. After proofing the dough, brush the top of the buns with yolk and put the baking sheet in the oven and in exactly 25 minutes we will get soft rolls with a slightly crispy crust (thats what I like).
28. While the rolls are in the oven, prepare the garlic sauce.
29. In a small bowl, crush the garlic, add salt, sunflower oil (you can use olive oil) and water. We mix everything. Impregnation is ready.
30. We pierce the slightly cooled rolls on top with a fork or a toothpick and coat with garlic impregnation.
31. Serve borsch with a rolls, sour cream and finely chopped herbs such as dill or parsley

**Original recipe link:** [https://craftycookbook.com/spicy-peanut-noodles-with-fried-shallots/](https://craftycookbook.com/spicy-peanut-noodles-with-fried-shallots/)

I'm so so happy with how this recipe has turned out! I've spent awhile working on this peanut sauce and I think the texture is great. A lot of peanut sauces are thick and cause the noodles to clump up, but the cornstarch slurry keeps this sauce silky. The fried shallots are a weird but wonderful addition, and they're really easy to make! Hope you guys try this one out!

Optionally, omit the fried shallots for a meal that comes together in about 15 mins!

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients**

* 8 oz. noodles, long fusilli, spaghetti, or similar
* 2 green onions, greens sliced thin
* ¼ cup crushed peanuts
* crushed red pepper flakes, optional

*For sauce:*

* ¼ cup creamy peanut butter
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
* 2 tbsp packed light brown sugar
* 1 tbsp sriracha sauce (for mild), add more to taste if desired
* 1 tbsp lime juice
* ½ tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 1 tsp grated ginger, or sub ¼ tsp powdered ginger
* 1 tbsp cornstarch

*For fried shallots:*

* 2 large shallots, \~¼ lb
* ½ cup vegetable oil

&amp;#x200B;

**Preparation  Fried Shallots**

1. Peel the shallots and slice them into thin slices, creating small rings. Separate the rings with your hands after slicing. 
2. Warm the veggie oil over medium heat in a small pot. Meanwhile, place a mesh strainer over a heatproof bowl, and line a plate with paper towels. 
3. Once the oil is hot, add the shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until they turn golden and crispy, about 7 to 10 minutes. 
4. When the shallots are ready, pour the mixture through the strainer. After straining, transfer the shallots to a paper towel lined plate and blot off any excess oil.

**Preparation  Peanut Noodles**

1. Begin boiling a large pot of salted water for the noodles. Prepare the noodles per package instructions for al dente while preparing the sauce. Drain and cover to keep warm until needed.
2. Mix the cornstarch with ½ cup warm water until fully dissolved. In a small pot, combine the cornstarch slurry and the rest of the sauce ingredients. Warm over medium-low heat and mix well. Allow the sauce to cook down until it thickens, about 5 minutes, then reduce heat to low until ready to use. If needed, add a splash of water to the sauce and mix well if it thickens up too much while waiting. Taste the sauce and add more sriracha if desired to make the dish truly spicy.
3. Pour the prepared peanut sauce over the noodles and mix until fully coated. Plate the noodles into the serving dishes and top with the crushed peanuts, fried shallots, green onion, and crushed red pepper flakes.

This salad is a whole meal all to itself. I had bought some items to make gyros and had a lot of tasty items still to use up so I created this salad. 

This salad is a presentation salad and takes some time to make but is pretty easy to do. It is probably not a quick weeknight kind of a meal.

This made two large salads.  It could also be used to make 6-8 side salads to go with something else. It could be tweaked any number of ways to taste but if you want to try to make it as I did yourself, here is the recipe:

**Ingredients &amp; Preparation:**

* 1 pound Souvlaki marinated baked boneless/skinless chicken breast, cooled and sliced.
    * **For the marinade:**
    * 4 tablespoons of olive oil
    * 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic
    * 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar
    * 1 tablespoon of water
    * Juice of one small lemon
    * 1 tablespoon dried parsley 
    * 2 tablespoons dried oregano
    * 1/2 teaspoon of salt
    * Cracked black pepper to taste
* One Heart of Romaine lettuce with edges trimmed, cut in half width wise.
* Half a English cucumber, cut into half moons.
* Half zucchini cut into quarter wedges
* Half  a yellow bell pepper, diced.
* 3-4 tablespoons of Tzatziki sauce per salad (make your own or purchase pre-made) 
* A few tablespoons (to taste) of Mediterranean seasoned feta cheese or plain feta per salad.
* One half of a small red onion, thinly sliced.
* (Optional) A few slices per salad to taste of a pickled element like asparagus, Kalamata olives, or pepperoncini.
* 2 whole wheat pita breads, cut into thin strips to make pita croutons.
    * **To make the croutons:**
    * 2 tablespoons of olive oil 
    * 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 
    * 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning
    * 1/4 teaspoon dried garlic or garlic powder
    * Cracked black pepper to taste
* 2-4 Tablespoons of Greek dressing per salad. (I used Kens Simply Vinaigrette Greek or you could make your own) 

**Directions:**
1. Whisk all the marinade ingredients together and pour over the chicken in a zip lock bag and refrigerate for four hours

2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and bake chicken whole for about 25 minutes until cooked through

3. Let chicken cool then put into the fridge until ready to slice

4. While chicken is cooking and cooling, whisk the pita bread seasoning and pour over pita slices in a bowl. Stir to evenly coat slices with the mixture.

5. Once the chicken is done, evenly spread the pita slices on a parchment covered baking sheet and bake at 350 for ten minutes. Let the croutons cool a bit and store sealed until ready to use

6. On each of two large plates, fan out the romaine pieces in a circular pattern until most of each plate is covered with lettuce

7. Put half of the sliced chicken in the middle of each plate

8. Scatter the cucumber, zucchini, and yellow pepper over each salad

9. Splatter the tzatziki sauce across each salad

10. Shake the feta cheese across the top of each salad

11. Put the onion and pickled element (if using) in a spiral pattern on top of each salad

12. Gather about half of the pita croutons into a pile and make a nest in the middle of each salad

13. You can keep the salads in the fridge until ready to serve, then drizzle with the Greek dressing just before eating",3294

* 75g butter
* 125g flour
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1 Nutmeg grated (to taste)
* 2 egg yolks
* 100g parmesan cheese

For the layers

* 12 lasagna sheets (softened for 20 seconds in hot water)
* 50g parmesan

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions**

For the ragu:

1. Heat the oil in a large pan and then add the vegetables and leave to fry for 5 minutes until softened and beginning to colour.
2. Add the mince and pancetta and fry for a minute or two then add the garlic, stock and rosemary and cook until the meat has browned on all sides.
3. Add the white wine and simmer until slightly reduced before adding the tomatoes and tomato puree.
4. Leave to simmer either on a low heat on the hob or in a preheated over at 160C for at least 1.5-2 hours.

For the béchamel:

1. heat the milk and bay leaf until it begins to simmer and then remove from the heat and set aside.
2. In a separate pan, melt the butter over a medium heat and then add the flour to make a roux then add the milk (slowly at first) whilst stirring constantly.
3. When you've added all of the milk, continue to stir over heat for about 15 minutes until the sauce becomes really thick.
4. Remove the bay leaf, season with black pepper and grate in the nutmeg to taste - I like to give it a really good grating.
5. Mix in the egg yolks, then parmesan and remove from the heat and allow to cool.

For the layers

1. Grease a square baking dish (mine was 26x26cm) and add two sheets of lasagna.
2. Cover the lasagna with a layer of ragu and then cover that with a layer of béchamel.
3. Repeat the process until you're out of ragu. If you've got the thicknesses right then you should have enough for 4 decent layers.
4. Top with a final layer of pasta, béchamel and then sprinkle over the remaining cheese.
5. Bake in a fan oven at 160C for 45-55 minutes until the cheese is bubbling and golden brown 

&amp;#x200B;

**Tips**

* You might want to turn the temperature up to 200C if its not cooked in 55 minutes to get the golden brown top but keep an eye on it because it will turn quickly. Don't turn the temperature up before then of the top will burn before the middle is cooked.
* The longer you leave the ragu to simmer the better it will taste. Aim for 3 hours if you have time.
* You can make any stage of the lasagna a day in advance, or make the lasagna and refrigerate overnight before cooking - the flavours will only develop more the longer you leave it.
* Tastes great reheated or even cold as leftovers too.

2022-06-27,28,"My Take on Pancit Bihon (with a vegetarian option)! One Pot Meal! Recipe in comments! =;=;","BlackCatKitchen","My Pancit bihon recipe is designed to be super easy to make! It might not be completely traditional, but Ive specifically chosen ingredients that are easy to find in most supermarkets! Filipino food isn't a cuisine I cook often, so if you make your pancit differently to me, let me know in the comments below!  
  
If you'd like to make this pancit bihon vegetarian, swap the pork for tofu, the oyster sauce for a bit more soy sauce and sugar, and finally, replace the chicken stock with water!  
  
\-----  
**INGREDIENTS**  
  
**Stir Fry**  


* 2 small carrots, sliced into strips  

* 300g fine green beans  

* a handful of spring onions  

* 1 savoy cabbage, shredded (or other cabbage)  

* 1 small onion, sliced  

* 3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped  

* 225g (8oz) rice vermicelli noodles  

* 450g (1lb) pork, cubed (or chicken, tofu)  

* a splash of vegetable oil (for frying)  


**Sauce**  


* 1 tbsp. sugar
* 2 tbsp. dark soy sauce
* 1 tbsp. oyster sauce (or more soy sauce and sugar)
* 2 tbsp. soy sauce
* 500ml chicken stock (or water)
* pinch of salt
* pinch of pepper
* 1 lime (optional)  
  
\-----  
  
**Method**  


1. Prepare your vegetables! Im cutting my carrots into thin strips, shredding a savoy cabbage, slicing my onions into rounds and finely chopping 3 cloves of garlic!  

2. Chop 450g of your favourite protein into bite sized cubes. For this recipe, Ive chosen to use pork. Add your protein to a hot wok. The fat from the pork will help to cook the meat, but if youre using a leaner protein or tofu, youll want to add some vegetable oil to the wok.  

3. Once your pork (or protein) is cooked through and brown, transfer onto a plate and set aside. To the wok, add a splash of vegetable and your onions. Give them a good toss. Once your onions begin to soften, add your garlic  and 30 seconds later, add in your pork (or protein!). Add a pinch of salt and pepper to season.  

4. Tip in all of your vegetables!  

5. Once your vegetables have started to wilt, its time to make the sauce! Add to the wok 1 tbsp. sugar, 2 tbsp. dark soy sauce, 1 tbsp. oyster sauce (or more soy sauce and sugar if keeping this vegetarian) and 2 tbsp. soy sauce. Give this a little mix before adding 500ml good quality chicken stock (or water if vegetarian).  

6. Now for the bihon! Add 225g rice vermicelli noodles to the wok. Press them down to help them absorb the sauce. Your noodles will begin to soften, which is when youll want to push them underneath the vegetables and sauce mixture, allowing them to nestle in all those delicious flavours! The noodles wont take long to cook, but keep your wok on the heat until the majority of the liquid has been absorbed.  

7. Once done, add some chopped spring onions to the mix (the green bits only!) and give it a quick stir!  

8. Serve with half a lime (Calamansi is traditional) in each dish, to be squeezed over your pancit bihon  and enjoy!  
  
  
  
This dish was so delicious, I've made it a few times since! I might try adding chicken and shrimp next time! As said, Filipino food isn't a cuisine I cook often, but I made this as part of a collaboration challenge. Let me know how I did! If you make yours different, let me know below! If you have any tips, you know where to add them! =;=;

2022-06-27,19,"S'Mores Layer Cake","ferociousbutrfly","**Recipe:** https://themindfulmeringue.com/?p=4563

**INGREDIENTS**  
***Moist Chocolate Cake***

* 1 cup All-purpose Flour
* 1 cup Granulated Sugar
* 1/2 cup Cocoa Dutch processed/Superior Red
* 3/4 tsp Espresso Powder
* 1 tsp Baking Powder
* 3/4 tsp Baking Soda

* 1 Egg
* 1/2 cup Milk of your choice!
* 1/4 cup Canola Oil or other light vegetable oil
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1/2 cup Boiling water

  
***Rich Chocolate Ganache***

* 150 mg Milk Chocolate roughly chopped
* 1/2 cup Heavy Cream heated to a boil
* Toasted Graham Cracker Crumbs
* 6 sheets Graham Crackers
* 1/4 cup Unsalted Butter melted
* 1 1/2 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* pinch of salt
* Marshmallow Fluff
* 1 jar Marshmallow Fluff
* Milk Chocolate Swiss Meringue Buttercream
* 6 Egg Whites
* 2 cup Granulated Sugar
* 1 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 100 mg Milk chocolate Melted and cooled slightly

**INSTRUCTIONS**  
   
***Moist Chocolate Cake***

1. Preheat your oven to 350F. Oil and line three 6 cake pans, with parchment paper rounds.
2. In large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, espresso powder, salt, baking soda and baking powder. 
3. Sift cocoa powder into flour mixture.  
To the flour mixture, directly add egg, vegetable oil, vanilla, and milk. Mix until well incorporated and mixture is a thick, glossy, dark brown paste.
4. Add boiling water to the mixture (slowly).
5. Gently stir until the mixture transitions from a paste consistency to a thin liquid consistency.
6. Pour 1/3 of cake batter into each cake pan.  
7. Bake cakes for 25-27 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean.  
8. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.

***Rich Chocolate Ganache***

1. Place chopped semisweet chocolate in a medium sized bowl. Add hot cream.
2. Let stand for 5 minutes, without mixing.
3. After 5 minutes, whisk mixture until homogenous (it will initially look as though it is not coming together, keep going! It will become smooth and glossy)
4. Ganache should be pourable consistency while not too liquid (If not quite the right consistency, let bowl refrigerate for 5-10 mins)  


***Toasted Graham Cracker Crumbs***

1. Preheat oven to 350F. In a food processor, pulse gram crackers until a fine crumb forms (this can also in a ziplock bag, crushing gram crackers with a rolling pin).
2. Once crumb forms, add sugar, cinnamon, and melted butter. Mix with spoon to incorporate.
3. Place wet graham cracker crumb mixture on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
4. Bake at 350F (325F convection bake) for 10-15 mins, until slightly golden. Let cool completely.
5. Milk Chocolate Swiss Meringue Buttercream
6. Start by cleaning the bowl of an electric stand mixer thoroughly to ensure all oily debris has been removed! Dry bowl completely.
7. Separate egg whites from egg yolks. Add egg whites one by one to the clean electric mixer bowl. Add sugar. Whisk egg whites with sugar.
8. Place bowl over a saucepan filled with no no more than 2 inches of water, simmering over medium heat (Note: this step creates a double boiler  the bowl should not be touching the water, it is the steam that will heat the egg whites)
9. Whisk sugar and egg whites, until mixture is frothy and sugar has dissolved (approximately 5 minutes). You can either feel the texture between your fingers at this point to ensure you can no longer feel sugar grains or check temperature with a candy thermometer (when ready, the mixture will be at 160F).
10. Return stand mixer bowl with egg white mixture to stand mixer. Reattach whisk and beat on medium-high speed. Beat until glossy, stiff, peaks form and mixture is no longer warm to the touch (\~10-15 minutes). I find you can speed up this process by placing ice packs on the sides of the base of the bowl as the mixer is running (this will more quickly cool the base)
11. At this time, you can melt chocolate in a small bowl in the microwave (10-15s increments, stirring after each interval). Once melted, set aside.
12. Once bowl and meringue have cooled, replace whisk attachment with a paddle attachment and begin adding butter (Note: Butter should be \~1 hour outside of fridge and still somewhat cool to the touch). Add 1 tablespoon of butter at a time, waiting until fully incorporated before adding more.
13. Once all butter has been added, add vanilla extract, salt, and melted chocolate. Turn mixer speed down to medium and continue to beat.
14. This Swiss Meringue Buttercream is finished when it is thick, creamy, and silky smooth. It will hold its shape very well. Continue to beat for another 3-5 minutes on low to remove air bubbles.

***Assembly***

1. Remove parchment paper backing from the first 6"" cake round.
2. Pipe a ring of the Milk Chocolate Swiss Meringue Buttercream around the rim of the cake round.
3. Add chocolate ganache to the centre and spread even layer. Pipe marshmallow fluff on top of the ganache. Finish layer with a generous sprinkle of toasted graham cracker crumbs. Add 2nd cake layer.
4. Repeat steps 2-3. Add third and final cake layer to the top. Frost with remaining Swiss Meringue Buttercream.
5. Refrigerate cake for 30 minutes
6. Once frosting is cool to the touch, dollop sides of cake with marshmallow fluff. Continue to add marshmallow fluff to the top of the cake. Torch marshmallow fluff with a kitchen torch until desired toasted appearance is created. Return cake to the refrigerator for 10 minutes.
7. Finish cake by adding chopped chocolate, graham cracker crumbs, and mini marshmallows to the top.",5638

2022-06-24,14,"Crispy Pakora Recipe","Radiant_Okra_23","These are the Crispiest pakoras ever. My mom has been making them like this for years, and they always turn out amazingly crisp and full of flavor.

Originally posted here: [Pakora Recipe](https://ikneadtoeat.com/mixed-vegetable-pakora/)

**Equipment**

* Box grater
* Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot
* Cooling rack

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup chickpea flour (also known as besan or gram flour)
* 5 tablespoons water (or as needed)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder (or to taste)
* 1 teaspoon chaat masala
* 1 teaspoon coriander powder
* 1 cup chopped spinach (also known as palak)
* 1 medium sized potato (grated or thinly sliced)
* 1 medium sized onion (thinly sliced)
* 2-3 tablespoons chopped coriander (also known as cilantro or dhania)
* 1-2 green chilli (chopped finely)
* Cooking oil for deep frying

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions**

**Making the Pakora Batter**

1. In a bowl, mix together the chickpea flour and spices. Mix well.
2. Add 3-4 tablespoons of water until a thick batter forms.
3. Add the vegetables and mix well. If needed add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until the batter is just clinging to the surface of the vegetables.
4. Once the pakora batter is ready, set it aside.

**Frying the Pakoras**

1. In a dutch oven pot or heavy bottomed wok, bring oil to medium high heat.
2. To see if the oil is ready for frying, drop a little bit of batter into the oil. If it floats up immediately, the oil is too hot for frying.
3. If the batter takes about 2 seconds to float up, then the oil is ready for frying.
4. Using two tablespoons (watch video) or using your hands, drop the batter into the oil. Fry only a few pakoras at a time.
5. Too many pakoras will crowd the wok, and cause the temperature of the oil to drop and the pakoras wont cook evenly.
6. Gently flip the pakoras while frying so that they cook evenly from all sides.
7. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pakoras from the wok and place on a cooling rack.
8. Serve with green chutney or imli ki chutney.

**NOTES:**

1. **Chickpea flour:** This is made from ground dried chickpeas, and also known as gram flour or besan. It's easily available in large supermarkets or Indian grocery stores.
2. **Water:** Only use a little bit to form a thick batter, for crispy pakora.
3. **Chaat Masala:** an Indian spice blend, it's tangy and spicy and adds a great flavor to these pakoras. Can be skipped, if you don't have it on hand
4. **Storage Instructions:** Pakoras are best enjoyed when freshly cooked. However, you can store leftovers in airtight container in the fridge for 1-2 days. To reheat, preheat oven to 180 C or 350 F and spread the pakora on a baking tray in a single layer. Bake for a few minutes until warmed through and crispy.

2022-06-24,20,"Chicken fillet with spices. The easiest recipe for juicy chicken breast.","Destiny_town","Hello friends!  
  
How are you?  
Now to the recipe. In fact, the recipe is quite simple to prepare, and any restaurant will envy the quality of the dish. You can choose spices at your discretion, although in my opinion the set that we have selected in this recipe is the most optimal, so, lets start.

**Ingredients  (for 1-2 persons)**

* Chicken fillet  1 half
* Onion  1 medium onion
* Salt  1/2 teaspoon
* Soy sauce  1 tablespoon
* Oregano  1/4 teaspoon
* Basil  1/4 teaspoon
* Rosemary  1/4 teaspoon
* Marjoram  1/4 teaspoon
* Thyme  1/4 teaspoon
* Olive oil  1 tablespoon

**Cooking**

1. Clean the fillet from membranes and cartilage (sometimes come across). Make a few not deep cuts on top.
2. Place the fillet to a deep container, salt.
3. Mix all dry spices in a bowl and coat the fillet well on all sides.
4. Add soy sauce and brush the fillet with it just as thoroughly.
5. Now add olive oil, coat.
6. Cover the container with the fillet with cling film and put it aside. Do not put in the refrigerator, as we will marinate for a short time  30 minutes.
7. Preheat the oven to 180°C (355°F)
8. Cut the onion into half rings
9. Put a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet so that later you can completely wrap the fillet in it.
10. Put the onion on paper, salt a little
11. Place the fillet on the onion
12. Close with paper, you can use a stapler to fasten the paper on the sides.
13. Put the baking sheet in the oven for 30 minutes.
14. After 30 minutes, we take out a fragrant, tender chicken.
15. A side dish of mashed potatoes is ideal for this fillet, in fact, for this we cooked with onions. The onion turns out to be very juicy, soaked in all the spices in which the chicken was cooked. (the recipe for three variants of mashed potatoes is in the article on the site)
16. Cut the fillet into the desired number of pieces, add mashed potatoes and onions.

Instead of mashed potatoes, you can serve rice as a side dish. Pickled cucumbers and garlic will be a good addition to the serving.  
  
Bon appetit!  
Thats all!  
Cook with pleasure!",2085

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken (I used half chicken thighs, half chicken tenders but use whatever is on sale!)
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 large carrots, peeled and large-diced
* 1 tablespoon dry thyme
* 10 cups water
* 3/4 cup white rice (I used short grain)
* 1/2 cup fresh dill, roughly chopped
* Salt and pepper to taste

METHOD:

**Prepare the chicken:**

* Pat the chicken dry and dice it into cubes. You'll break it apart later with a fork, so it doesn't have to be perfect.
* Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.

**Brown the chicken:**

* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large soup pot over medium-high. Cook the chicken in batches for 35 minutes on each side until browned all over. Transfer it to a plate.

**Cook the aromatics:**

* If the pot seems too dry, add another drizzle of oil. Add the onion and carrots and cook for 56 minutes. Add the thyme and cook 1 minute more. Season with salt and pepper.

**Simmer the soup:**

* Add the chicken back to the pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low and hard simmer for 3040 minutes until cooked through. Shred with a fork after it's tender if you like. You can also leave the pieces whole if you don't feel like fussing with breaking the chicken apart. Season the broth liberally with salt and pepper.

**Cook the rice:**

* Bring the soup back to a boil. Add the rice and reduce heat to medium-low. Hard simmer for 30 minutes until tender. The broth should reduce down and be pretty rich at this point.
* You can add a bit more water in 1/2 cup increments if the rice absorbs too much liquid!

**Finish the soup:**

* Stir in the dill and taste the broth and season to your preferences. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

* Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with more dill if you like.

*Serves 2 - 4*

This is one of my favourite ways to eat cabbage. The fried capers are salty, crispy and satisfying, and the savoury black garlic brown butter works wonderfully well with the refreshing tang from the buttermilk dressing, lifted by the lemon.

**INGREDIENTS** 

* 1 head cabbage (savoy, hispi or napa are great)
* 50ml buttermilk
* 2 tbsp. greek yoghurt
* 2 tbsp. mayonnaise
* 1 tsp. honey
* 1 lemon
* 2 tsp. white pepper
* 2 large black garlic cloves
* 1 small shallot
* 30g chopped hazelbuts
* 3 - 4 tbsp. capers
* 90g unsalted butter (approx.)
* fresh chives
* gochugaru

**METHOD**

1. Prepare the dressing by mixing the buttermilk, yoghurt, mayonnaise, honey and  
white pepper together. Finely chop the shallot and add it. Zest all of the lemon and  
set the gratings aside for later, but use ¼ of the juice in the dressing. Mix well until  
pourable.
2. Remove any loose outer leaves from the cabbage and cut straight down the centre  
and then again to make four segments. Heat some oil in a large pan and place them  
face down to caramelise and char a bit. Flip them and do the same on the other face  
side. When both are coloured, turn them onto their backs and add half of the butter  
and begin basting the segments. After a few minutes add the remaining butter along  
with two tbsp. of capers and baste again. Allow the capers to go crispy in the  
browning butter. Move the cabbage around a bit and cook the layers through while  
continuing to baste. A bit of bite is ok, but you can test it by pricking it with a skewer  
or trussing needle. When it is almost ready add the black garlic, chopped into pieces  
and turn the heat off.
3. To serve, place the cabbage segments on a platter or plates and spoon the capers  
and black garlic over the top. Squeeze a little bit more lemon and drizzle the  
dressing. Add some pinches of gochugaru, lemon zest, some chopped hazelnuts,  
some fresh and finely chopped chives. Add one to two more tbsp. of fresh capers if  
desired.",2074

The perfect option for a special occasion meal at home! This dish is loaded with lobster and scallops, coated in a tangy lemon garlic wine sauce! If youve never prepared lobster at home before, this is a great first recipe to try! It uses lobster tails, which are so much easier than preparing a whole lobster.

Recipe link: [https://craftycookbook.com/lobster-scallop-bucatini/](https://craftycookbook.com/lobster-scallop-bucatini/) 

**Ingredients** 

* 2 small (3-4 oz) lobster tails
* 8-10 sea scallops 
* 8 oz bucatini, spaghetti, or similar 
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* ¾ cup dry white wine (one mini-bottle)
* 1 large lemon, juiced and zested (\~¼ cup lemon juice)
* ½  tbsp fresh thyme 
* 5 tbsp butter, divided
* salt
* fresh cracked black pepper
* olive oil   


**Instructions**

1. Halve the lobster tails lengthwise: Use sharp kitchen shears to cut through the shell on the top of the tail, then flip it and repeat along the bottom. Once the shell is cut, use a sharp knife to slice the flesh, which should completely halve the tail. Rinse the pieces, then pat completely dry with paper towels. Season the flesh with salt and pepper.
2. Rinse the scallops, then thoroughly pat dry with paper towels. Season all over with salt and pepper.
3. Begin bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Cook pasta per package directions for al dente as you cook the rest of the meal. I add my pasta to the water when I begin simmering the wine in step 8.
4. Place a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once warm, add 2 tbsp of butter. Once the butter has melted, add the lobster tails shell side down and cook for 2-3 minutes until the shells begin to turn bright red. Flip the tails, so they are flesh side down, and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the flesh is cooked through. Remove the tails to a plate and let cool while you cook the scallops. When the lobster is cool enough to handle, pull the flesh from the shells, then chop it into small pieces. Set aside and tent with foil to keep warm.
5. Carefully discard the remaining butter from cooking the lobster, and wipe the skillet clean. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil over medium high heat. Add 1 tbsp of butter to the skillet just before adding the scallops. Add scallops to the skillet in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until golden brown on the outside- about 2-3 minutes per side. Set aside and tent with foil to keep warm.
6. Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic to the pan (keeping any remnants from the scallops). Add a little more olive oil if necessary to cook the garlic, cooking until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.
7. Add the wine to the pan and scrape up any brown bits, incorporating them into the sauce. Simmer over medium heat until the sauce thickens and loses about T  of its volume - about 5 minutes. 
8. Reduce the heat to low and add the lemon juice, lemon zest, and remaining 2 tbsp of butter to the skillet. Season with ½  tsp salt and a dash of fresh cracked black pepper (to taste). Simmer for another 1-2 minutes until well combined.
9. Add the pasta to the skillet and mix well, so the sauce fully coats the noodles. Place the noodles into the serving dishes, then top with the scallop and lobster pieces. Pour any remaining sauce over the pasta and garnish each dish with fresh thyme.

A recipe for a universal dish for you. After all, crepes can be served with sour cream, honey, maple syrup or jam. In addition, crepes can be made with meat, fish or vegetable filling. [Original recipe and a little bonus here](https://grillmangal.art/en/thin-crepes-the-perfect-breakfast-recipe/)

**Ingredients**

* Wheat flour  250 g
* Milk  500 ml
* Water  150 ml
* Eggs (60-65 g)  3 pcs (60-65 g each)
* Sugar  1/2 teaspoon
* Salt  1/2 teaspoon
* Sunflower oil (for frying)  2-3 tablespoons
* Butter  20 gr

**For cooking**

* Dish for kneading dough
* Corolla (whisk)
* Frying pan with a thick bottom
* Spatula

**Cooking**

1. First, heat water and milk to 35-40°C (95-100°F)
2. Pour water and milk into a dish in which we will prepare the dough for crepes
3. Add salt and sugar here, stir well to dissolve.
4. Break eggs into a dish. Stir until a uniform color. The yolks are fine  they mix well, but you have to mess around with the white longer. Many famous chefs prefer to stir with a fork, but we will use a whisk.
5. Gradually add flour, and stir so that there are no lumps. You can pour out all the flour at once, but in parts it is still more convenient and faster. Pour about half of the flour for the first time, stir and add the rest of the flour.
6. We heat the pan over high heat. It also needs to be cooked on high heat.
7. Add half a tablespoon of oil to the pan. You can cook without oil, then you get a slightly different pattern on the surface of the crepes  a uniform light brown over the entire surface.
8. Pour the dough into the pan and quickly turn it so that the dough is evenly distributed in a thin layer over the pan.
9. Fry on one side no more than 40-50 seconds
10. We pry the edges with a spatula, make sure that the crepe does not stick and is fried, and carefully turn it over. And if you are familiar with the technique of flipping crepes by tossing them, then its absolutely wonderful. Its not really difficult, just more self-confidence and practice.
11. Turned over, also fry for 40-50 seconds, put on a dish, grease the finished crepe with butter and cover with a lid or towel.
12. And so are all the other crepes. 40-50 seconds on each side, put on a dish, grease and cover.

\*From the indicated amount of ingredients in a frying pan with a diameter of 26 cm, exactly 13 crepes should be obtained. If it turned out less, then some crepes turned out to be thicker than the rest.

\*If you have a frying pan of a smaller diameter, then the main thing is to find out the volume of the ladle with which you will pour the dough into the frying pan. And here is just the first pancake to help: you can use it to determine the degree of heating of the pan and the amount of dough for one serving.

\*To check, put a little oil on the pan, if a faint bluish smoke appears, then you need to remove the pan from the heat, wait one or two minutes, put it on the heat again and start cooking.

Crepes can be served with honey, jam, sour cream or any syrup.

**Crepes with filling**

You can also make crepes with cottage cheese, meat or fish. It makes no sense to do a separate article, Ill just tell you how do i do it, since the principle is the same.  
  
1.Version  
  
We cool the finished crepes, spread the filling evenly over the entire surface of the crepes and wrap it as a roll. This is how crepes are usually made with cream cheese and salmon (slightly salted).  
  
2.Version  
  
Crepes fry on one side, spread on a plate, cool. We spread the pre-cooked minced meat (minced meat fried with onions) on the fried surface, wrap the pancake as an envelope and fry the envelope until cooked on both sides.  
  
Instead of minced meat, you can use any filling, for example: cottage cheese, jam or the same salmon with cheese.  
  
3.Version  
  
This option is for the more experienced. Put the filling (ready-made minced meat or herbs or salmon) in a pan and pour the dough. Also fry on both sides. Skill is needed here so that when the dough is distributed over the pan, all the filling does not end up in one place.

Thats all!

The classic Italian dessert needs no introduction. Luxurious, creamy and so simple to make.  
  
Watch the [instructional video here](https://youtu.be/6m-4wxowUa8)  
  


**Ingredients**  
For the panna cotta

* 2 ½ sheets of gelatin
* 1 vanilla pod (or two if you are feeling adventurous)
* 400ml double (heavy cream)
* 150ml Milk
* 50g caster sugar

To serve

* Strawberry
* Raspberry Coulis
* Blueberries

  
**Instructions**

1. Soak the gelatin in cold water for 5 minutes.
2. Split the vanilla pod lengthways and remove the seeds with the back of a kitchen knife.
3. In a small saucepan, heat the cream, milk, sugar, and vanilla on a medium heat until it begins to simmer but be careful not to let it catch. Remove from the heat.
4. Squeeze the water from the gelatin and add to the cream mixture, stirring until fully dissolved.
5. Transfer the mixture to 4 ramekins and refrigerate for at least 2 hours until set.
6. When ready to serve, loosen from the ramekin by holding in hot water for a few seconds and turn out onto a plate.

2022-06-13,87,"Gravlax: finally nailed it","hre","**Ingredients**

* Salmon fillet
* Salt
* Sugar
* Dill or other aromatics

**Directions**

1. Rinse fish of juices from packaging.
2. Combine salt and sugar in a 3:2 ratio by weight. For two fillets, I used 225g salt and 150g sugar
3. Add aromatics to dry brine; use more than you think. For 375g of dry brine, I added 10-15g of dill
4. Lay plastic on a sheet tray and spread brine on the plastic.
5. Lay fish on the plastic and spread brine thickly on top
6. Wrap the fish tightly and place in the fridge for \~36 hours, flipping every 12 hours
7. Remove the cured fish from the plastic and rinse it under cold water
8. Let the cure rest uncovered in the fridge for 1-2 hours to firm up and dry out
9. Slice &amp; serve

Notes:

* Just about any salmon will do so long as it smells good when you pull it out of the package. If it doesn't smell nice enough to eat raw, it won't taste great cured.  I have used king salmon, coho, steelhead, and sockeye. I have bought it from the nice-ass fish monger, I have bought it local line-caught at the farmer's market, I have bought Atlantic Farm-Raised at Costco.
* I have tried with weights and without, it doesn't make a difference to the cure.

Click here to access the full recipe, as well as amazing tips, how to troubleshoot your macarons: [https://thelunarbaker.wordpress.com/2022/06/12/how-to-make-french-macarons/](https://thelunarbaker.wordpress.com/2022/06/12/how-to-make-french-macarons/)

**Ingredients**

*Macaron*

* 170g icing sugar
* 160g ground almonds
* 120ml egg whites from about 4 medium eggs, separated into 2 equal batches
* 160g granulated sugar
* 1/2 tsp red food colouring

*Filling*

* 120g double cream
* 110g dark chocolate, finely chopped
* 25g unsalted butter, room temperature
* 75g raspberry jam

**Instructions**

1. Place the almond meal and powdered sugar in a food processor. Sift it and discard any big bits or remains that dont go through the sieve.
2. Place the egg whites with cream of tartar in a grease-free bowl and start whisking with an electric whisk on medium speed.
3. After a minute, start adding the granulated sugar one spoon at a time
4. Once all the sugar has been added  turn to medium-high and whip until stiff peaks.
5. Add extract and food colouring and mix the colour well
6. Fold in the almond mixture to whipped egg whites in three batches
7. Once the almond mixture has been incorporated, we need to bring it to the right consistency. Use a spatula and spread the mixture around in the bowl  then bring it back to the centre. Do it again and again until you have a good consistency
8. Consistency-wise, you need a dropping consistency. This means that when you hold a little batter on the spatula it drops down like a ribbon and blends back after about 30 seconds
9. Transfer the batter into a piping bag with a large round tip. Pipe similar size macarons onto a lined baking tray using a template
10. The best way to pipe the macarons is to hold the piping bag at 90% and squeeze until you have a good mound then swirl the tip to one side
11. Tap the baking tray on the counter several times
12. Let the macarons sit in a cool dry place for about 30 to 50 minutes until it forms a skin on top. If you touch the shell it should not stick to your fingers
13. While the macarons are drying  preheat the oven to 150oC
14. Bake the macarons for about 13 minutes (depends on your oven). The tops will look set but the bottom should not be wet. The top shell should be shiny and the bottom crusty
15. Let the macarons rest in a cool dry place for about 15 to 20 minutes so the tops get lightly crusted.
16. Cool on the baking tray for at least 10 minutes before you remove and transfer to a cooling rack.
17. To make the filling, place the cream in a small saucepan and the chocolate in a medium bowl. Bring the cream just to the boil and pour over the chocolate. Leave to stand for a few minutes, then stir to combine. Add the butter and stir until smooth, then leave to set until thickened. Place the chocolate mix into a clean piping bag with a smaller nozzle and pipe around the edge of half the macarons. Fill the centre with jam and sandwich with another macaron shell
18. Once finished, the macarons will improve with an overnight rest in the fridge

**Recipe Tips (see site for more tips)**

* For best results, use powdered food colouring as water-based colours and oil-based gels will thin the mixture
* Straining the flour ensures it is consistent so dont skip
* The cream of tartar helps to stabilise the egg whites. You can omit it but it is especially helpful when making macarons in warm weather
* Adding the sugar one spoon at a time will prevent the protein in the egg whites from breaking down
* Templates ensure all shells are similar in size
* In places with high humidity, forming a skin can take up to 60 minutes
* Trying to remove the macarons from the hot tray can cause the tops to separate from the bottom feet. Once you let them cool, they will come off easily",3832

1. Boil the pasta according to the instructions on the package
2. Crush the garlic
3. Heat the wok with high heat on the stove
4. Add oil into the wok and adjust the stove to medium heat
5. Stir fry the garlic in the wok until the garlic becomes yellow and its smell comes out
6. Stir fry the mixed vegetables with garlic until the smell of the vegetables comes out
7. Sitr fry the ham, mixed vegetables and garlic together until the ham gets a bit dry
8. Sitr fry the pasta with the ingredients inside the wok for 5 minutes
9. Add salt into the pasta and continue stir frying for 3 minutes
10. Add sugar into the pasta and stir fry the ingredients for 2 minutes
11. Serve the food on the dish

**Cooking tips**

1. Stir fry the pasta with a pair of tongs slowly instead of a fry so the pasta will not be broken easily
2. There should be a little bit of oil left on the wok after the stir frying is finished and the dish is served.
3. The pasta can smell a bit burnt to get a better taste
4. Usually medium heat is used for stir frying so the food will not be burnt easily and it takes not too much time to get the food fully cooked
5. Salt is often used in pasta to get the pasta tasty, so more salt is used than sugar in pasta. Sugar is also used to enhance the flavour, but not too much is used.
6. Thick pasta is preferred to get a better texture.",1516

**Ingredients:**

* 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter
* 3/4 cup Light Brown Sugar
* 1/4 cup Granulated Sugar
* 1 tbsp Heavy Cream or your milk of choice! (ideally with a high fat content)
* 1 Egg large
* 2 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1 1/4 cup All-purpose Flour
* 1 tsp Baking Soda
* 1/2 tsp Salt + extra pinch for tops of finished cookies!
* 1 cup Mixture of Semi-sweet and Milk Chocolate roughly chopped

**Instructions:**

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
2. In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt butter. Swirl pan every 30 seconds until butter begins to sizzle. Reduce heat to low. Continue swirling for \~3 minutes or until melted butter becomes foamy, makes popping sounds, and begins to take on a nutty aroma! Mixture will begin to turn golden brown and have brown flakes interspersed. Using a wooden spoon or spatula stir butter, lift browned butter bits from the bottom of the pan. Remove from heat and allow to cool. In the meantime, move onto step 3.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. (This process aerates and sifts dry ingredients!) Set aside.
4. Using a large bowl with an electric mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat sugars (brown and granulated) with melted brown butter and heavy cream for 1 min. Add in egg and vanilla extract. Stir until combined and scrape sides of bowl once more to incorporate all the batter.
5. Slowly add flour mixture to the wet butter/sugar/egg mixture, beating on low speed until just combined. Add roughly chopped chocolate pieces to the batter. Stir until combined.
6. Scoop dough into 2 tbsp portions and set on flat plate/baking sheet.
7. Refrigerate dough for at least 1h (this step allows all of the beautiful cookie flavours to combine and form a perfectly spread cookie!)
8. Preheat oven to 350F (325F if using convection bake).
9. Once dough is chilled, remove from fridge and place cookies onto baking sheet, spaced 2"" apart.
10. Bake cookies at 350F for 12-14 min or until the edges are golden brown (mine were perfect after 13 min at 325F convection bake).
11. Sprinkle each cookie with flaked salt upon removing from the oven!

[Traditional Swedish meatballs](https://theswedishfood.com/swedish-meatballs/traditional-swedish-meatballs/)

Meatballs the traditional way. Served with mashed potatoes and pickled cucumbers. You may also add some cream sauce and lingonberry jam. I hope you enjoy. =)


Ingredients for meatballs

* 1 onion
* 0.5 cup milk
* 0.5 cup breadcrumbs mix
* 1 egg
* 2 tbsp beef stock
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp butter
* 1 lb minced meat
* 0.5 tsp salt
* 2 dashes black pepper
* 2 dashes allspice, ground

But hold on, mister. What kind of meat should I choose for meatballs? Good question my dear fellow human being. If you want juicy meatballs you should go 50/50 or 70/30 with beef/pork ratio. You could go 100% either way. If youre going with 100% beef you HAVE to use breadcrumb, milk and/or cooking cream in the mixture to make it juicy. 100% pork, well, that will become incredibly fatty. This recipe is made with 100% beef.




Ingredients for mashed potatoes

* 2 lb potatoes
* 1 cup of milk
* 3 tbsp cooking cream
* 1 dash of salt
* 1 dash of black pepper



Ingredients for pickled cucumber

* 1 cucumber
* 1 cup water
* 10 tbsp sugar
* 10 tbsp white vinegar 12%



How-to:

Start with the pickled cucumber. It has to sit for an hour before its ready. While the pickled cucumber is on hold, you can start preparing for the main dish. As well as the mashed potatoes.

* Cut the cucumber into thin slices.
* Bring the water, white vinegar, and sugar to a boil.
* Let it cool, then pour it on top of the cucumber.
* Let it rest for one hour.



Continue with the mashed potatoes.

* Peel and dice the potatoes into even pieces. This will decrease the amount of time needed to be boiled.
* Boil potatoes until soft all the way through. 10-15 minutes depending on the size of the potatoes.
* Mash the potatoes. This is most efficiently done with a potato press.
* Heat up cooking cream with milk. Add to the mashed potatoes.



During the boiling of the potatoes, its a good idea to start with the meatballs.

* Peel and mince onion. Fry in 2 tbsp of butter until soft.
* Mix breadcrumbs, milk, beef stock, mustard, and egg. Let swell for 5 min.
* Add the minced meat and onion together with all the spices.
* Evenly mix it all together.
* Roll into medium-large meatballs. Fry in remaining butter and oil for 5-6 min.



Cream sauce (optional)

Bring 1 and a quarter cup of cooking cream, 2 tbsp of beef stock, and 1 tsp of soy sauce to a boil. While boiling, add and stir 1 tbsp of corn starch.

Boil while stirring for 5 minutes. If the sauce is too thin, add some corn starch. Too thick, add some cream. Finnish it by seasoning with salt and pepper.



Tips for making good meatballs

* Dont handle the meat excessively. Neither when mixing the meat nor when rolling the meat into meatballs. This squeezes out fat resulting in dryer meatballs.
* Roll meatballs with oily/buttery hands. It makes it easier.

There you go! Serve it with a side dish of lingonberry jam and you will have a complete meal! Smaklig måltid",3097

Making the Vanilla Layer

Ingredients

- 1 and 1/2 gelatin sheets

- 1/2 cup heavy cream (118 ml)

- 1/2 cup milk (whole or 2%) (118 ml)

- 2 tbsp sugar (25 g)

- 1/2 tsp vanilla 

Directions

1. Place the gelatin sheets into a bowl and cover with cold water. Set aside for 5 minutes to allow the sheets to soften.

2. Combine heavy cream, milk, sugar, and vanilla in a saucepan.

3. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Once at a simmer and the sugar is dissolved, remove from the heat.

4. Squeeze any excess water from the gelatin sheets and place the sheets into the hot milk. Whisk to combine and thoroughly melt the gelatin.

5. Pour the milk mixture through a sieve or strainer into a liquid measuring cup. This will ensure a smooth panna cotta mixture and also make the liquid easier to pour.

6. Have ready 6 serving glasses. Optionally, if you want a stylish presentation, you can set your glasses at an angle in a muffin tin so the vanilla layer also sets at an angle before you add the chocolate layer later.

7. Pour the milk mixture evenly between the 6 serving glasses. Then refrigerate for at least an hour to set. Panna cotta should set somewhat firm but jiggly. Once set, start on the chocolate layer.

Making the Chocolate Layer

Ingredients

- 1 and 1/2 gelatin sheets

- 1/2 cup heavy cream (118 ml)

- 1/2 cup milk (whole or 2%) (118 ml)

- 2 tbsp sugar (25 g)

- 1/2 tsp vanilla 

- 2 ounce chopped, bittersweet chocolate (57 g)

Directions

1. Place the gelatin sheets into a bowl and cover with cold water. Set aside for 5 minutes to allow the sheets to soften.

2. Combine heavy cream, milk, sugar, and vanilla in a saucepan.

3. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Once at a simmer and the sugar is dissolved, remove from the heat.

4. Stir chopped chocolate into the hot milk until completely melted and combined.

5. Squeeze any excess water from the gelatin sheets and place the sheets into the hot milk. Whisk to combine and thoroughly melt the gelatin.

6. Pour the milk mixture through a sieve or strainer into a liquid measuring cup. Let mixture cool down until just room temperature, about 15 minutes.

7. Bring the six serving glasses out from the fridge and out of the muffin tin if using.
Pour the chocolate panna cotta mixture on top of the vanilla layer, dividing evenly between the 6 serving glasses. Then refrigerate for at least an hour to set.

- 4lb pork shoulder, fat cap trimmed off and cut into 1.5 - 2 cubes 
- 1 onion, diced 
- 1 red and 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 1 habanero pepper, quartered 
- 1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley, chopped 
- 5 sprigs fresh thyme 
- 4 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar 
- juice of 1 orange, 1 lemon, 2 limes
- 1 1/2 tbs Worcestershire sauce 
- 2 tbs olive oil 
- 1 tbs black pepper 
- 1 tbs kosher salt 


Marinade: Combine thyme, parsley, onion, peppers, salt, pepper, garlic, juice, Worcestershire, vinegar, and cubed pork. Marinate overnight. 


Pork: Preheat oven to 325. Put pork and its marinade in an enameled Dutch oven and heat on stove over high heat until simmering. Put in oven and cook covered for 1.5 hrs, stirring it a few times throughout. Remove pork pieces and place on a baking sheet. Drizzle pork with olive oil and a bit of salt. Put oven on broil and finish the pork under the broiler for 5-10 mins until crispy around the edges. 

Sauce: After removing the pork from the pot, strain to separate the liquids and solids. Return the liquids to the pot and keep simmering to reduce by  about half. An optional step to make this sauce extra tasty is to take the strained veggies and blend them to a purée, add half of it back to the simmering liquid to make a thicker gravy like sauce. 


**Cauliflower Rice:**
- 1 head cauliflower 
- 1 tbs olive oil 

Remove leaves and larger stems from cauliflower. Cut into small pieces and pulse in a food processor until broken down into small grain-sized pieces. Heat olive oil in a large pan and sauté cauliflower for 5 minutes. Cook covered to retain moisture, but stir occasionally to avoid burning.

* Sesame Oil 1/2 tbsp

Once all the ingredients are prepared, it's as simple as putting the dish together.

* Scoop out a portion of rice into a bowl, the add the vegetables and proteins separately.
* Add your choice of sauce and sprinkle some pine nuts on top.

All that's left, is to mix the entire bowl so that the sauce gets spread out nice and evenly and enjoy!",2858

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients**

* 2 eggs
* 1¼ cup wheat flour
* 2½ cup milk
* 2 tbsp butter (2 tbsp for the batter, but you will need some more for the frying)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp sugar

**How-to**

* Beat the eggs while slowly adding the flour.
* Slowly, while whisking, add the milk.
* Melt the butter and add to the batter. Season with salt and sugar.
* Slowly heat the frying pan with a click of butter.
* Beat the batter now and then so the flour doesnt sink to the bottom.
* Pour some batter into the frying pan. When it looks like it can hold, turn it over.

**Tips on how to make good pancakes**

* When the batter starts to burn at the outmost edges, this is usually when its ready to be flipped and fried on the other side.
* Butter the pan frequently in between pancakes.
* Use a non-stick pan or cast iron pan.
* Let the batter rest for 10 minutes. This will lessen lumps (allows the flour to absorb liquids). But remember to stir before pouring on the frying pan.
* Make sure the ingredients are of the same temperature. This will lessens lumps in the batter.
* Keep stirring the batter so the flour doesnt settle on the bottom.",1275

You can see how I made it [here](https://youtu.be/bMT7ijRrJU4)

*Ingredients*

**Cake:**

* 220g all purpose flour
* 60g cocoa powder
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 300g granulated sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 240ml whole milk, room temperature
* 1 tbsp white vinegar
* 2 eggs, room temperature
* 100g vegetable oil
* 250ml boiling water
* \~500g fresh strawberries

**Ganache:**

* 350g chocolate
* 200ml whipping cream
* 30g unsalted butter
* Pinch of salt

*Directions*

***For the cake:***

1. Mix milk and vinegar and set aside for \~5-7 minutes, until the milk curdles. Preheat oven to 176ºC/350ºF.
2. In a large bowl, sit flour and cocoa powder, add baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt. Mix well.
3. In a separate  bowl, mix eggs, vegetable oil, and curdled milk.
4. Mix the wet and dry mixtures until uniform. Slowly add boiling water while whisking until the water is fully incorporated. Continue whisking until the batter is uniform (no lumps).
5. Line cake pans with parchment paper. I use cake strips to keep the cake from doming. Pour the batter equally among the 2 pans. Each pan should not be more than 2/3 full.
6. Put both pans on one cookie sheet and bake for 30-40 minutes. Cake is ready when a toothpick is inserted and comes out clean.
7. Once they are done baking, cool pans for 10 minutes on a cooling rack, then take the cakes out of the pans and set them on the cooling rack to cool completely (at least 1 hour).
8. Once the cakes are cooled, cut them into 2 layers each.
9. Wash, hull, and halve all but 3-4 strawberries. Chop or cut the remaining strawberries and set aside to eventually decorate the top, i.e., in a pile or a design.

***For the ganache:***

1. Melt the chocolate, cream and butter in a bain marie, then stir in the salt.
2. Turn off the heat. Once fully melted, set aside 225g of the ganache and chill (preferably until set, but it can be a little liquid).
3. Put the remaining bowl with ganache back on the saucepan (without turning on the heat) until the cake is assembled. If it sets, melt it until its liquid.

***Assembly:***

1. Place one cake layer, then arrange the strawberry halves horizontally flat side down around the edge of the cake.
2. Pipe the chilled ganache in the center, filling any gaps between the strawberries.
3. repeat with the next cake layer.
4. Place the final layer on top.
5. Pour the warm ganache over the top of the cake, allowing/pushing some of the ganache so that it drips over the sides.

Making the Cake:

Ingredients:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour (125 g)

- 1/2 tsp baking soda

- 1/2 tsp cinnamon

- 1/4 tsp nutmeg

- 1/4 tsp salt

- 4 tbsp butter (56 g)

- 1/4 cup brown sugar (50 g)

- 2 tbsp granulated white sugar (25 g)

- 1 large egg

- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

- 2 tbsp buttermilk (30 ml)

- 1 ripe large banana (mashed)

Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Butter and flour a 6-inch (15 cm) bundt pan.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.

3. In a medium saucepan, cook butter over medium heat until melted and browned, stirring constantly. It should take about 3 minutes. You will see it change color and aroma with brown bits forming at the bottom. Immediately take it off the heat and pour into a medium bowl.

4. Whisk together the browned butter and both sugars. Whisk in egg, vanilla and buttermilk. Then mix in the mashed banana. Pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture. Fold together until just combined, do not over-mix. Pour batter into prepared bundt pan.

5. Bake for 24-26 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted the cake comes out clean. Let cool in the pan for 15 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely. You may need to run a knife or offset spatula around the cake to loosen it from the sides of the pan.

Making the Glaze: 

Ingredients

- 1 cup powdered sugar (130 g)

- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

- 1/2 tsp espresso powder

- 1 tbsp melted butter

- 1 tbsp corn syrup or honey

- 1/4 tsp salt

- 1 to 2 tbsp milk (15 to 30 ml) [or as needed]

Directions

1. Whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla, espresso, melted butter, corn syrup or honey, salt, and a tablespoon of milk. If glaze is still powdery or clumpy, whisk in more milk a little at a time. The idea is to get as thick of a glaze as possible without it being powdery or clumping up. Hence, add the milk sparingly.

Making the Crumble:

Ingredients

- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour (31 g)

- 2 tbsp brown sugar (25 g)

- 1 tbsp white granulated sugar (13 g)

- 1/4 tsp cinnamon

- pinch of salt

- 1 tbsp melted butter

Directions

1. Heat flour in the microwave in 20-30 second intervals, stirring in between, until it reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) on a food thermometer. This took me about 2 intervals. This purpose is to heat the flour to make it edible without baking it.

2. Add in both sugars, cinnamon, salt, and melted butter.

3. Stir with a fork until mixture forms a coarse crumble. If mixture looks too dry, add in a little bit more melted butter.

Assembly:

1. Using a spoon or piping bag, glaze the top of your cooled cake with the coffee glaze you made earlier and let the glaze drip down the sides.

2. Sprinkle the top of your cake with the cinnamon crumble.

**CRUST:** 

* 2 1/2 cups flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 6 tbsp unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
* 2/3 cup vegetable shortening, chilled
* 1/2 cup ice water

**FILLING:** 

* 2 cups hulled and chopped fresh strawberries
* 8oz cream cheese, softened
* 1 egg
* 1/2 tsps vanilla extract
* 1 cup plus 3 1/2 tbsp sugar
* 3 tbsp cornstarch

&amp;#x200B;

**CRUST INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Preheat oven to 450 F. Mix flour and salt together in a large bowl, then add the butter and shortening.
2. Mix all of the ingredients until mixture resembles coarse sand. You can do this with your fingers, a fork, or a food processor. Whatever works!  

3. Add ice cold water one tbsp at a time to the mixture until there is just enough moisture that the dough begins to stick to itself and forms large clumps. You don't wanna see any dry bits.  

4. Transfer the dough onto a floured surface, and fold the dough into itself using floured hands. The dough should not be overly sticky and should come together easily. Cut the dough in half, and form two discs. Cover with plastic wrap and store in fridge for at least one hour but up to 5 days if you wanna save it for later.  


**FILLING INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. In a food processor, process strawberries with cornstarch. Add puree and 1 cup sugar to a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat until the mixture becomes thick like jam. Set aside.
2. In medium bowl, combine together egg, vanilla, cream cheese and 3 ½ tbsp of sugar with a hand mixer until light and fluffy. Set aside. If it looks a lil clumpy, that's okay!  


**ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Roll pie dough out flat onto a floured surface and cut out rectangle shapes until there is no dough left, making sure to cut an even numbered amount so you have enough top and bottom layers to complete the hand pies.
2. To the bottom layers of the pies, spoon some of each filling mixture down the center of the pie, making sure to stay clear of the edges so the pie doesnt overflow.
3. Place the top layer of dough on top of the filled bottom layer, and press the edges together with your fingers to seal the pie. Cut a slit down the center of the hand pie.  

4. Brush each pie with egg wash and place in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.

2022-05-28,17,"Dessert of sponge cake crumbs and cocoa. Easy and lazy recipe","Destiny_town","Hello friends! For you, a new recipe, a delicious and sweet dessert is obtained. [Original recipe](https://grillmangal.art/en/dessert-of-sponge-cake-crumbs-and-cocoa/)

And if you still have a sponge cake or sponge cookies, then this dish is prepared in 40 minutes.

Well, if not, then lets start with a dough for a sponge cake.

**Ingredients (sponge cake dough)**

* Wheat flour (highest grade)  2 tbsp
* Eggs (60-65 gr)  3 pcs
* Sugar  3 tablespoons
* Cornstarch  1/2 tbsp

This amount is enough for the sponge cake in our recipe. The dessert will weigh about 500 gr.

**Ingredients (syrup)**

* Butter  75 g
* Sugar  1.5 tbsp
* Water  3 tbsp
* Cocoa powder  2 teaspoons

**Additionally**

* Cognac  2 teaspoons

**Cooking** (if you have a ready-made sponge cake or cookies, then skip steps 1-4)

1. First of all, preheat the oven to 400°F and prepare the baking dishes in advance.
2. Cooking in a water bath \*. In a convenient container, break the eggs, add sugar and begin to stir with a whisk. As soon as the sugar dissolves, we bring the temperature of the mixture to 45-50 degrees and remove from the water bath, continuing to knock down. The volume of the mixture should increase at least 2 times in the worst case.
3. Cool to room temperature and gradually add flour mixed with cornstarch, but do not beat down, but stir lightly (and now we work not with a whisk, but with a spatula) so that there are no lumps.
4. Achieve uniformity of the mixture, pour everything into a mold and immediately put it in the oven for 20 minutes.
5. Make syrup. Put the saucepan on gas stove, first on a high heat. Put butter in a saucepan. Dissolve it to a liquid state, add sugar and water. We achieve a boil, reduce the heat to low, stir and add cocoa here.
6. Cook for 2 minutes, turn off and cool to room temperature.
7. Cool the sponge cake, you can dry it a little if it is too soft. But, do not get carried away  you need some of the cake crumbs to be soft. Rub some on a grater, cut some with a knife into small pieces (0.5 cm each).
8. Pour the resulting crumbs / pieces into a mixing container, once again crush everything with our hands, rub it.
9. Add cognac, mix well.
10. Add the resulting syrup, mix very well.
11. Spread it on a plate, form any shape you like and put it in the freezer for 30 minutes.
12. After 30 minutes, the dessert is ready.

Thats all!

Cook with pleasure!

\*A water bath is a cooking method for some dishes. Water is poured into a deep big pan and heated to 160-180°F. A smaller pan is placed in this big pan, in which the dish will be cooked. The main thing is that water from a large pan does not fall into a smaller one.",2669

**METHOD**

1. Take a heavy-bottomed saucepan and add in all of the ingredients except for half of the butter. Begin whisking continuously over a medium heat, keeping the mixture moving. If the curd begins sticking to the bottom turn the heat down, try to aim for just below boiling point and watch as it begins to thicken. 
2. When the mixture can coat the back of a spoon you will know it is ready, at which point you should take it off the heat.
3. Give it a few more stirs and add the remainder of the butter to the saucepan. Whisk until incorporated and even.
4. Pass the mixture through a fine sieve and into a bowl. Cover the surface with clingfilm so that it is in contact with the curd and press out any air bubbles. This will stop a skin forming.

2022-05-25,43,"Honey Sesame Pan-Fried Tofu","Iiari","Looks like a great recipe!  Some comments/thoughs to possibly make this easier/healthier:

* Freezing tofu (I usually do it in the package) and then defrosting it is a nice way to firm it up, but very time consuming for such a simple recipe and requires planning ahead.  Just get extra firm tofu (if available) or press/compress your firm tofu for a little longer than usual.  I highly recommend buying a tofu press.
* If wanting to make this healthier, you could bake rather than fry the tofu.  I personally find frying tofu takes a surprisingly long time, can be messy (with the water content, splattering can happen), and the window between nicely fried and too fried is somewhat narrow.  I prefer baking, which I find easier and healthier and, when smothering with a marinade as here, has no taste difference (this recipe isn't about the frying, it's about the sauce).  I'll include my favorite baking tofu ""base"" recipe below.  After baking, I just toss the tofu it in a pan under some heat with the marinade and you'll never know or taste the difference.
* The most variable part of this is likely the chili bean sauce or its substitutes (like Korean Gochujang sauce, or sriracha, sweet chili sauce, etc).  Know who you're cooking for and experiment with amounts slowly increasing until you get the flavor you want.

My base recipe for baked tofu:

Baked tofu:

14 ounces extra firm tofu

1 tablespoon neutral oil (vegetable or avocado)

1 teaspoon nutritional yeast (optional, but recommended)

1 tablespoon corn starch

1 teaspoon garlic powder

&amp;#x200B;

* Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees
* Take the tofu out of the package and press for 15 minutes if you have a tofu press and 30 minutes if you don't.
* Cut the tofu into cubes. Add it to a large mixing bowl. Add the oil, nutritional yeast, garlic powder and corn starch and a pinch of salt. Gently mix until everything is mixed together well. Be gentle while stirring to make sure you don't break the tofu.
* Add the tofu to a lined baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes or until tofu is crispy and golden brown.
* Make main recipe marinade during the baking time.",2126

# RECIPE:

*Before anyone asks, you can absolutely remove the shrimp tails if you don't like them. I like to leave them on, personally.*

My shrimp came already peeled, but if you have peels on, I highly recommend making your own homemade shrimp stock (just cook the shrimp peels in a few tablespoons butter, add un-peeled, quartered shallot, head of garlic, halved and some celery with leaves and 8 cups water, bring to a boil and then hard simmer for an hour until reduced to 56 cups needed for this recipe. strain through a sieve into a large bowl and then discard solids. you can pop the cloves out of the garlic and mash into a paste and add it to the spicy stew if you're feeling fancy)

BUT, if you don't have time for homemade shrimp stock, water (for those watching our BP) or prepared chicken or veggie stock works fine too.

This was super good. It was a remake of a recipe that didn't photograph well, but I made some tweaks and this ended up tasting even better so I'm really happy with it.

* While the stew simmers, prepare the rice according to package instructions. For 3 cups of cooked rice, youll need 1 cup of dry white rice. Set aside and keep warm.

## Poach the shrimp:

* Bring a large saucepan of generously salted water to a boil. Once boiling, cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice from both halves into the pot. Add the lemon halves to the pot and turn off the heat. Immediately add the shrimp, cover, and let stand off the heat for 5 minutes. The residual heat from the boiling water will gently poach the shrimp. Next, remove the lid and check the shrimp for doneness. Cover and let stand in hot water for an additional minute or two if they arent fully opaque.

## Finish the shrimp:

* Melt the butter into a bowl. Add the parsley and garlic powder. Using tongs, pick the poached shrimp from the pot and add them to the bowl of melted butter. Toss to coat. Taste and season with salt, if needed.

## To serve:

* Divide the cooked rice between shallow bowls and ladle the hot stew around the rice. Pile the poached shrimp on top. Finish with a drizzle of hot honey, if you like. Enjoy!

2022-05-23,7,"Belyashi, small round meat pies","Destiny_town","Hi friends! Specially for you, a recipe for delicious meat pies. Based on Asian recipes. [Original recipe](https://grillmangal.art/en/belyashi-small-round-meat-pies/)

For 10 pies

**Ingredients (dough)**

* Wheat flour  320-350 g
* Sunflower oil  2 tablespoons
* Eggs  1 pc
* Yeast (dry)  10 g
* Salt  1/4 teaspoon
* Milk  125 ml

**Ingredients (filling)**

* Beef meat- 300 g
* Onion  3 pcs (medium)
* Salt  1/2 teaspoon
* Ground black pepper  1/4 teaspoon
* Water  70-80 ml

Of course, you can take ready-made dough and ground meat, but it will not be the same.

**Cooking**

1. Lets start with a dough. Pour warm milk into the container in which you will knead the dough and pour the yeast into it. Let the yeast dissolve well while stirring. Now add salt and eggs, stir and add the sifted flour.
2. Knead the dough well, it takes about 7-10 minutes for kneading, so that the dough is homogeneous and without lumps
3. Add oil, mix, cover with cling film and put the dough in a warm place.
4. After 2 hours the dough should rise well. We crush it and again cover with a film and leave for 45-50 minutes. After the first kneading, the dough should rise quickly. And as soon as the rise starts to decline, we knead the dough a second time.
5. While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Everything is easier here.
6. Cut the meat and onion and run through the meat grinder. Add salt, pepper and water. Mix well. Ready
7. Everything is prepared, we begin to make pies. Divide the dough into 10 equal parts.
8. Roll each part into thin circles, put the ground meat in the center of the circle, pinch the edges, leaving the middle open. (see photo) Let the pies stand, rest for 30-40 minutes.
9. Heat up the oil in a frying pan. Put the pies on the pan with the open side down. Fry for 3-5 minutes on one side, turn over and the same amount on the other. If you like it more fried, hold for 5-7 minutes on each side. (on the photo  both options were made)
10. It is all

Let me give you a couple of tips:

Do not put all the pies at once in one pan.

Let the oil reheat between batches.

Thats all!

### Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot

### Ingredients

* 2 teaspoons olive oil
* 1/4 cup avocado oil
* 2 Yukon gold potatoes, about 3/4 pound total, peeled and diced
* 1 head of garlic, divided
* 1 big turnip, divided
* 2 15- ounce can white beans, like butter or great northern, drained and rinsed
* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
* Fresh herbs for garnish, like celery leaves or parsley
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Prepare the ingredients:

* Peel the garlic cloves. Thinly slice three of the bigger cloves and then mince the remaining. Peel the turnip and cut off about 1/4 of the turnip. Dice the larger half of the turnip. Very thinly slice the smaller half of the turnip into paper-thin half-moons.

#### Boil the potatoes:

* Cover the Yukon gold potatoes with water in a medium pot and season with salt. Bring to a boil and then cook until fork tender. Scoop out 3 cups of the potato cooking water and set aside. Drain the potatoes and transfer them to a second bowl and then mash until completely smooth. Set aside. Wash out the pot used to cook the potatoes and return it to the stovetop as you will use it to fry the turnips.

#### Cook the beans:

* Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a wide pot. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 45 seconds being careful not to burn it. Add the white beans and Dijon mustard and stir to coat. Add the 3 cups of potato cooking water along with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil.

#### Whisk in the mashed potatoes:

* Spoon the mashed potatoes into the broth and whisk until completely smooth. Continue whisking until the potatoes are fully incorporated into the broth. It will take a few minutes for it to completely combine into a smooth broth. Just keep whisking! Taste and season with salt and pepper. Add more water, as necessary, to thin the broth out to your desired consistency.

#### Simmer the broth:

* Add the diced turnips to the broth and reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes or until the turnips are fork-tender.

#### Fry the turnips:

* Add the avocado oil to the pot used to cook the potatoes and turn the heat to medium or medium-high depending on your stove. Once hot and shimmering, add the very thinly sliced turnips in an even layer and cook, turning occasionally, for 12 minutes per side until golden brown. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt.
* Add the thinly sliced garlic to the hot oil and stir constantly for 1 minute until golden brown. Spoon onto the paper towel-lined plate and season with salt.

#### To serve:

* Taste the broth once more and season with salt and pepper. Turn off the heat. Ladle the broth into bowls and garnish with the crispy turnips and garlic. Add your favorite herbs on top. Enjoy!

2022-05-20,5,"Eggs with mashed potatoes in the oven. Good breakfast option for family.","Destiny_town","Hi friends!  
  
Many people are constantly racking their brains to cook something like this for breakfast& Pancakes, omelettes, scrambled eggs, croutons, etc. Our recipe is not the fastest to prepare, but as an option.  
  
What we get in the end: 6 servings of eggs with mashed potatoes with mushrooms and cheese.

Well, lets get started.

**Ingredients**

* Potatoes  1,300 kg
* Butter  35 g
* Champignons  95 g
* Milk  150 ml
* Cheese  160 g (Swiss or mozzarella)
* Salt  2 teaspoons
* Eggs  6 pcs
* Sunflower oil  3-4 tbsp

**Cooking**

1. We cut the potatoes into small cubes (slices), and throw them into boiling water. Salt, and let it cook until cooked  15-20 minutes as the water boils.
2. Finely chop the mushrooms.
3. Melt the butter in a frying pan or saucepan, and put the chopped mushrooms there. Fry for 7-10 minutes. Then add milk and a teaspoon of salt. We make the low heat and let it all stand on for 10 minutes. You can also add your favorite spices if you like.
4. Boiled and potatoes and begin to knead it, gradually adding milk with champignons. There is a small caveat here  children also take part in the tasting, and they like softer mashed potatoes, hence such proportions of milk and butter in relation to the amount of potatoes.
5. The mashed potatoes is done, now we grease the baking dish with oil and spread the potatoes. Level it. For this recipe, a 2 liter glass baking dish is enough.
6. Grate cheese and sprinkle over potatoes.
7. Preheat the oven to 430°F and put the mashed potatoes sprinkled with cheese there. The time depends on what kind of cheese you are using. Usually no more than 10-15 minutes, as soon as the cheese is reddened, we take it out.
8. With an egg, carefully make a well in the mashed potatoes with cheese (do not forget to wash the eggs before doing this), break it and pour it into the resulting well. and so 5 more times.
9. Put the dish back in the oven for another 15 minutes. Here again, it all depends on the correct operation of the oven. Focus on such a moment better  as soon as the yolk begins to be covered with a white film, then its time to turn it off and get it out. 
10. Take a knife and a spatula, and cut.

Thats all! Bon appetit!

If you like this recipe I have plenty more on my website [Leviathan Food](https://www.leviathanfood.com/). I spend a lot of time developing, photographing and writing recipes independently so checking it out is very much appreciated. 

**INGREDIENTS**

*Serves 2*

* 2 eggs
* 1 large garlic clove
* brioche loaf
* 1 small leek
* 400g mushrooms
* 6 tbsp. panko breadcrumbs
* 1 tsp. gochugaru
* 1 tsp. dried mixed herbs
* 1/2 tsp. dried tarragon
* 1/2 lemon (juice &amp; zest)
* 2 tbsp. cream cheese
* 1 tbsp. crème fraîche
* 1 tsp. dijon mustard
* ice &amp; water
* fresh parsley

**METHOD**

1. Chop the tops off the leeks and rinse the outer leaves. Slice down the centre and julienne the smaller middle leaves as thinly as possible. I do this two or three layers at a time. You can use this as garish as is, or for a little theatre soak the strips in ice water for about 20 minutes and they will curl up. You can help them on their way by bunching them together after a few minutes in the water. Drain and dry and set aside. 
2. Mix the cream cheese, crème fraîche and mustard un a bowl. Chop the mushrooms and fry in two batches to ensure they get enough heat. Add olive oil to the pan with a knob of butter. You want to colour the mushrooms and avoid them becoming watery. Don't be afraid to add more oil as they soak it up. When the second batch has cooked add the first back in and grate in the garlic before adding tarragon, dried herbs and gochugaru. Grate half a lemon into a bowl and set aside before adding the juice to the hot pan. Sauté for another minute and turn the heat off.
3. Wipe out the pan and rub a small bit of butter around to evenly coat it and set on a low to medium heat. Cut thick slices of the brioche and lightly toast. To assemble the dish, spoon the creamy mixture over the bread and top with the mushrooms. Scatter the leeks on the plate and garnish with fresh parsley and lemon zest along with whatever seasoning is needed . The final step is to prepare and fry the egg yolks and place on top.
4. Add two or three spoonfuls of panko breadcrumbs to a bowl. Crack two eggs and separate the whites from the yolks, saving the whites for another recipe if desired. Lay the yolks on the panko and gently spoon more on top so that they are completely covered. heat some oil over a high heat in a clean pan and add the yolks . They are very delicate so be careful when transferring and turning over. They only need a dew seconds and a higher heat is better to crips up the panko. If this seems like too much hassle you can always fry or poach eggs as normal.",2662

### Equipment

* Deep roasting pan with a rack
* Aluminum foil
* Food processor
* Wide pot

### Ingredients

#### Shredded duck:

* 4.5- pound whole duck giblets, and neck reserved for another use
* Salt and pepper
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 4 ounces oyster mushrooms shredded
* 4 tablespoons salsa taquera or use chipotle sauce
* 2 oranges juiced
* ½ cup water more as needed

#### Broccoli slaw:

* 1 pound broccoli with stems
* 1 lime
* 1 jalapeño trimmed
* ½ cup loosely packed cilantro rinsed thoroughly
* 6 tablespoons vegan mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon maple syrup
* 1 teaspoon hot sauce of choice
* ½ red onion finely minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### For serving:

* 8 soft corn tortillas
* Finely minced cilantro and red onion
* Crumbled cotija cheese
* Lime wedges

### Instructions

#### Prepare the duck:

* Preheat the oven to 325ºF.
* Line a deep roasting dish with foil. Place a rack on top of it. Pat the duck dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Place the duck on the rack, breast-side up, and transfer to the oven for 2 hours.
* Remove the duck from the oven and make shallow slits in the skin of the breasts and around the thighs and legs. Return to the oven for an additional 1 hour 30 minutes.
* Remove the duck from the oven and let cool for 30 minutes. Pick the meat from the bones and shred it once the duck is cool enough to handle. You can keep as much or as little of the skin as you like. I recommend keeping all the crispy skin from the breast and thighs. I discarded the skin around the back and cavity of the bird.
* At this point, you can transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate it overnight, or you can continue with the recipe straight through.

#### Prepare the broccoli for the slaw:

* Trim off the very bottom 1/2 of the stalks of broccoli. Roughly chop. Transfer to a food processor in batches, if needed, and pulse until just finely chopped. Dont over-process the broccoli! Pour the minced broccoli into a large bowl.
* Using a microplane, zest the lime straight into the bowl of broccoli.

#### Prepare the dressing:

* Juice the lime into the food processor. Add the jalapeño, cilantro, vegan mayonnaise, and hot sauce. Blend until completely combined and smooth.

#### Finish the slaw:

* Pour the dressing over the broccoli and toss to combine. Add the finely minced red onion and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving bowl and refrigerate until needed.

#### Prepare the duck filling:

* Heat the 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the shredded oyster mushrooms. Cook for 67 minutes until they begin to crisp up. Add the shredded duck and cook in an even layer without moving for 5 minutes. Try to get the pieces of skin to get as much contact with the hot pan to ensure the skin crisps up a bit. Season with salt and pepper, if needed.
* Add the orange juice and salsa taquera to the pot and toss to coat. Pour in the water or chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes until thicktaste and season once more to your preferences.

#### Prepare the garnishes:

* As you wait for the duck to finish simmering, mince your cilantro and red onion and transfer them to separate bowls. Crumble the cotija cheese into a third bowl. Set aside.

#### Char the corn tortillas:

* Char the corn tortillas over an open flame for 1530 seconds per side if you have a gas range. If you dont have a gas range, follow the instructions for heating the tortillas on the back of your package. Once theyre heated through, place two corn tortillas on each dish for service for four.

#### To serve:

* Spoon the cooked duck filling into each tortilla and pile the broccoli slaw on top. Garnish with cilantro and minced red onion. Add the crumbled cotija cheese on top. Serve with lime wedges. Enjoy!

2022-05-13,7,"Salted Butter Chocolate Chunk Shortbread by Alison Roman","pizza_andbeer","**Salted Butter Chocolate Chunk Shortbread Cookies** by Alison Roman

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (2¼ sticks) cold salted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* ¼ cup (packed) light brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
* 6 ounces semisweet or bittersweet dark chocolate, chopped (but not too fine, you want chunks, not thin shards of chocolate)
* 1 large egg, beaten to blend
* Demerara sugar (for rolling)
* Flaky sea salt

**Directions**

1. Line a rimmed baking sheet (two, if youve got em) with parchment paper.
2. Using an electric mixer and a medium bowl or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, both sugars, and vanilla on medium-high till its super light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Using a spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and, with the mixer on low, slowly add the flour, followed by the chocolate chunks, and beat just to blend.
3. Divide the dough in half, placing each half on a large piece of plastic wrap. Fold the plastic over so that it covers the dough to protect your hands from getting all sticky. Using your hands (just like youre playing with clay), form the dough into a log shape; rolling it on the counter will help you smooth it out, but dont worry about getting it totally perfect. You can also do this using parchment paper, if you prefer, but I find using plastic wrap easier when it comes to shaping the log. Each half should form two logs 2 to 2¼ inches in diameter. Chill until totally firm, about 2 hours.
4. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
5. Brush the outside of the logs with the beaten egg and roll them in the Demerara sugar (this is for those really delicious crispy edges).
6. Slice each log into ½-inch-thick rounds, place them on the pre-pared baking sheet(s) about 1 inch apart (they wont spread much), and sprinkle with flaky salt. Bake until the edges are just beginning to brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly before eating them all.

**Notes**

* The cookie dough can be made ahead and stored, tightly wrapped in plastic, up to 1 week in the refrigerator, or 1 month in the freezer.
* Cookies can be baked and stored in plastic wrap or an airtight container for 5 days.
* I recommend Maldon flake salt.",2261
2022-05-12,2,"Lamb leg baked in the oven. Very simple, but at the same time the meat is soft and juicy","Destiny_town","Hi friends! Another lamb recipe. Very simple, but at the same time the meat is soft and juicy. And no bad smell. 

Try cook it this way and I hope you like it. In any case, thanks for reading.

**Ingredients**

* Leg of a young lamb  1 piece (2.5 kg)
* Garlic  4 cloves
* Salt  2 tablespoons
* Paprika  2 tablespoons
* Rosemary  2 sprigs
* Mineral carbonated water  100 ml

**Cooking**

1. We remove excess fat and films from the leg of lamb. We also cut off the shank, it will go to another dish. And most importantly (if your butcher didnt it): in the area of knee, on the inside between the two muscles, find a lump of fat and remove it  there is a lymph node, which gives the lamb a nasty smell.
2. Make small and shallow cuts, most importantly, if there is a film on the ham, then you need to cut it so that the spices get inside.
3. Put the leg in a deep dish.
4. Crush the garlic, and mix it with all the spices (salt, paprika & you can add ground pepper).
5. Rub the leg well on all sides.
6. Let rest for 20 minutes and then pour mineral water.
7. Cover with cling film and put in the fridge for two hours.
8. After 2 hours we take it out, let it stand in the heat for 30 minutes.
9. And we wrap it first in baking paper (add a couple of sprigs of rosemary here), and then in a layer of foil.
10. Preheat the oven to 200° and put our dish for 15 minutes.
11. After 15 minutes, reduce the temperature to 160° and cook for 1 hour 40 minutes.
12. In principle, it will already be ready, but if you want to get a beautiful crust, then open the foil and paper, switch the oven to the grill mode (at 200°) and cook the leg for another 10 minutes, no more.
13. Thats the whole recipe.

2022-05-10,23,"Jerk Chicken Soup Recipe","BushyEyes","This soup was seriously SO good and you only need a few ingredients for a really flavorful dinner. I love jerk chicken but never attempted to make it on my own. Since I dont really grill, I wasnt able to make an authentic jerk chicken recipe, but this take still hit my cravings pretty well!

I used a pre-made Jamaican jerk sauce that I found at H-mart but you can use your favorite brand, or try making your own!

### Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons neutral oil divided
* 2 yellow onions peeled and quartered
* 5.5- pound whole chicken giblets, and neck reserved for another use
* 6 tablespoons of your favorite Jamaican jerk sauce
* 10 cups of water plus more for the soup
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 4 large carrots peeled and diced
* 5 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and diced
* 1 teaspoon smoked black cardamom optional, or use a dash of liquid smoke
* Cooked white rice for serving
* Minced scallions for serving
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Prepare the stock:

* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the quartered onions and sauté for 6 minutes. Add the jerk sauce and sizzle it for 1 minute.
* Add the whole chicken and cover with 10 cups of water. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 23 hours or until the chicken nearly falls off the bone. The broth will reduce pretty significantly. Taste the broth and add salt, if needed.
* Turn off the heat and let it cool. Transfer to the refrigerator overnight.

#### Pick the chicken from the bones:

* The next day, remove the chicken from the broth. The broth will be quite congealed because of the collagen.
* Pick the chicken from the bones and discard the carcass.
* Transfer the pot of congealed broth to the stovetop. Turn the heat to medium. As soon as the broth has returned to liquid, strain through a sieve, and discard any solids. You will have about 45 cups of spicy broth for the soup.
* Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.

#### Prepare the soup:

* Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of neutral oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion, carrots, and celery (with leaves!) and sauté for 10 minutes until beginning to brown in spotsseason with salt and pepper. Add the smoked black cardamom and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.

#### Simmer the soup:

* Add the chicken to the pot. Measure the spicy broth base before adding. Youll want about 8 cups of the liquid total for the soup, so if you have 4 cups of broth base, add 4 cups of additional water. Add the broth base and the water as needed and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes or until the carrots are tendertaste and season with salt and pepper.

#### To serve:

* Spoon warm, cooked rice between bowls and ladle the soup on top. Garnish with minced scallions. Enjoy!

Schupfnudeln, also known as fingernudel, are beautiful and delicate potato dumplings pan fried in butter and sage! This schupfnudeln recipe only requires 4 ingredients, most of which you probably already have at hand!

Schupfnudeln are a specialty from the Baden region of southern Germany and are also popular in Austrian cuisine! These potato dumplings are similar to the Central European kopytka, or Italian gnocchi!

If youre a visual learner, check out my video recipe here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmrNYAVRwRU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmrNYAVRwRU)

\-----

**Ingredients**

* 750g potatoes
* 1 egg
* 200g flour
* a good grating of nutmeg
* 2 tbsp. butter
* 12 sage leaves (5 whole, 5 chopped)
* 3 tsp. salt

  
**Serves:** 2 people as a main, 4 people as a side

\-----

**Method**

1. Add 750g potatoes to a large pot of cold water. Add a generous amount of salt to the water and cook at maximum heat for 35-40 minutes. No need to peel or chop just yet!
2. Once a knife goes into a potato smoothly  and/or the potato skins are beginning to split  drain your potatoes. Place the colander over the pot you cooked them in; any excess steam will help dry the potatoes! Let them cool to the point where you can handle the potatoes and then peel the skins. A knife works really well and the skins should come off easily.
3. For the best results, use a potato ricer to mash your potatoes. However you can use a potato masher too! Create a little well in the middle of your mashed potato. Grate a good amount of nutmeg (nutmeg is the key ingredient!), salt generously and add a lightly whisked egg into the well.
4. Bring the mixture together with your hands, almost as if youre kneading bread! Add a few tablespoons of flour at a time and continue kneading. Add flour as you need  up to around 200grams. Once the dough forms a smooth ball and does not stick to your counter, its done! Be sure not to over-knead the dough.
5. Fill a large pot of water and bring it up to a boil on maximum heat. Dust a baking tray with flour, which will prevent your schupfnudeln from sticking! Cut off a quarter of your dough and start rolling it into a log. Your potato log should around ½ - 1 inch thick. Now slice your log into 1 inch pieces!
6. Now for the schupf! Start by rolling each potato piece into a small ball, and then gently rub your hands back and forth to create a baguette shape! Place your schupfnudeln onto your dusted baking tray. I like to shake my baking tray back and forth to ensure each schupfnudeln is covered in flour, so they dont stick together!
7. Now generously salt your boiling water. Drop your schupfnudeln into the water. Stir gently with a slotted spoon. Once they float to the top, theyre ready to come out! This usually takes around 2-3 minutes. Place onto a clean tea towel to dry.
8. Now for the sauce! Pick 5 sage leaves and set aside. Slice a further 5 sage leaves. To a hot frying pan, add 2 tbsp. butter and 2 whole sage leaves. Your schupfnudeln should now be dry. Once your butter is bubbling, add your sliced sage leaves and your schupfnudeln!
9. Once the schupfnudeln begin to brown on one side, use tongs to turn them gently, until golden all over.
10. Serve and enjoy!!

- Milk 500ml  
- Sugar 90g  
- Agar- Agar Powder 7g  
- Milk Chocolate 150g  
  
Recipe:  
1. Mix Milk, Sugar, and Agar-Agar Powder until dissolved in a pot  
2. Cut Milk Chocolate into small pieces, add into pot  
3. Boil the mix until thick  
4. Pour into a rectangular mold, cool down for 1 hour, fridge for a few hours  

TIPS

* Using milk chocolate gives you the unmissable sweetness, but if you're a fan of dark chocolate, then just replace and add a little more sugar to balance things out.
* Use a spatula to help pry it loose from the mold, it should come out pretty easily after the sides have been loosened
* Eat it as is, or with whipped cream for that texture differential.
* The pudding is much much better cold, so be sure to keep it in the fridge for a few hours after it has cooled down. DO NOT KEEP THE HOT PUDDING IN THE FRIDGE, it will raise the temperature of the fridge significantly, giving possibility to spoil other things.

#### Finish the pasta sauce:

* Once the sauce finishes simmering, add the sliced basil and lemon juice. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

They're soft, light, delicious, super easy to make - and covered in an irresistibly tangy and sweet lemon glaze!

\-----

**INGREDIENTS**

**Lemon Ricotta Cookies:**

* 488g flour
* 225g unsalted butter, softened
* 362g granulated sugar
* zest of 1 lemon
* 1 tsp. lemon extract
* 425g whole milk ricotta cheese
* 2 eggs
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* 2 tsp. baking soda

**Lemon Icing:**

* 230g icing sugar
* 4-5 tbsp. lemon juice
* 3 tbsp. melted butter

\-----

**Method**

\`1. Preheat oven to 180C / 350F. Into a bowl, add 488g flour, 2 tsp. baking soda and ¾ tsp. salt and give it a quick mix to combine the ingredients.

2. To a mixing bowl, 225g unsalted butter (softened), 362g granulated sugar and the zest of 1 lemon. Set your lemon aside for later! Cream together your butter and sugar until its smooth and fluffy. Be sure to scrape down the sides (if using a mixer) to ensure everything is fully incorporated!

3. Mix in 2 eggs, one at a time, and 1 tsp. lemon extract. Mix until a cake-like batter is formed.

4. Drain any excess water from your soft ricotta cheese. Its okay if some liquid remains, but try to remove as much of the liquid as you can! Add your 425g soft whole milk ricotta cheese to your butter and sugar mix and stir until it just comes together.

5. Add your dry ingredients to your batter mixture. Fold by hand to bring all the ingredients together. However try not to over mix at this point; over mixing will result in a less delicate cookie!

6. Use a cookie scoop (or two spoons) to portion out your cookies onto a baking tray. Bake for 9  12 minutes. Once the cookies have a light golden colour around the edges, theyre done!

7. Once out of the oven, let them cool on the baking tray for 2-3 minutes, before moving them to a cooling rack.

8. Lets make our lemon icing!! To a bowl, sieve 230g icing sugar and add the juice of 1 lemon (the lemon you used earlier!), as well as 3 tbsp. melted butter. Whisk together until this makes a lovely icing! If the icing is too thick, add some water. You want the ribbon off the whisk to disappear almost instantly when it drips back into the bowl of icing!

9. Now dip the tops of your cookies into the icing, swirl around to ensure the top is fully covered, and then set aside to allow the icing to firm up. The icing doesnt harden fully due to the butter. This is also the perfect time to add any sprinkles or other decoration!

10. Serve and enjoy!!

If you have any questions regarding this recipe, please do feel free to ask here and Ill answer them as soon as I can! These are my husbands new favourite cookies!! =;=;

## Ingredients

* 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 1 teaspoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and thinly sliced
* 23 tablespoons butter, optional (if you like a richer sauce)
* 1½ pounds yellow potatoes cubed
* ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes optional
* 6 cloves of garlic peeled and minced
* 1 pound Roma tomatoes quartered
* 1 cup water or chicken stock
* .5 ounces basil leaves thinly sliced, a few basil leaves reserved for garnish
* ½ lemon juiced
* 1 teaspoon vinegar
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

## Prepare the chicken:

* Preheat the oven to 400ºF.
* Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper.

## Fry the chicken:

* Heat the neutral oil in a wide skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook without moving for 56 minutes or until the skin turns deep golden-brown. Flip and cook an additional 23 minutes. Transfer to a plate.

## Cook the vegetables:

* Add the sliced onion to the skillet and cook over medium heat for 56 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the butter. Once melted, add the potatoes and season them all over with salt and pepper. Cook for 812 minutes until the potatoes deepen in color. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes if you like.
* Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Next, add the tomatoes and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper.

## Bake the chicken:

* Pour in the water or chicken stock and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat. Place the chicken on the potatoes, skin-side up, and transfer to the oven. Bake for 2030 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 165ºF and the potatoes are fork-tender.

## Finish the sauce:

* Return the skillet to the stovetop. Transfer the chicken thighs to a plate. Turn the heat on the skillet to high, and once boiling, add the basil, lemon juice, and vinegar. Cook for 34 minutes or until the sauce has reduced slightly. Taste and season.

## To serve:

* Spoon the potatoes into shallow bowls and place a chicken thigh on top. Garnish with more basil, if you like. Enjoy!

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, please visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/linguine-with-clams/](https://maplewoodroad.com/linguine-with-clams/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 8 ounces linguine
* 4-5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 50 little neck clams (2 pounds)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced (1-2 tablespoons)
* ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1 cup dry white wine (eg Sauvignon Blanc)
* ½ cup reserved pasta water
* ¼ cup fresh Italian flat leaf parsley, finely chopped
* Kosher salt to taste

  
**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Start bringing the pasta water to a boil. When you add salt, use a little less than usual. 
2. While following the steps below, cook 8 ounces of pasta slightly less than al dente, as it will finish cooking in the sauce.
3. In a saucepan large enough to fit the clams in no more than about two layers, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil, add the clams, and cover with a lid. Shake and stir occasionally. It will take about 8-10 minutes (depending on the heat) until the clams open up.
4. When the clams have all opened up, put a strainer in a bowl to catch all the cooking liquids when draining the clams. 
5. Remove the meat from most of the cooked clams, but also leave some in the shell. The clams left in the shell make an excellent presentation when serving, and the clams removed from the shell will get the full pan sauce treatment on all sides.
6. Using the same saucepan you just cooked the clams in, heat 4 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, and add 1 tablespoon (or 2) minced garlic and ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes. Let the garlic (and pepper flakes) soften for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
7. Put the clams (including the ones you left in the shell) back into the pan and give it a good stir. 
8. Crank up the heat and add 1 cup of dry white wine (Sauvignon Blanc works great) and let the wine reduce (steam) for about 5 minutes. Reduce heat.  
9. Add ½ cup pasta water and the cooked and drained pasta, and give it another good stir. Taste and add salt as needed.
10. Drizzle with another 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and ¼ cup finely chopped Italian parsley. Use tongs to serve. Enjoy!",2157

She called it Voodoo Fudge which is quite fitting because it is very strange.  Salty and sweet.  When I got to researching similar recipes a lot of people call it plain old Maple Bacon Fudge - I still like Voodoo Fudge though!

Here's how I made it:

**Ingredients**

3/4lb Bacon (leanest you can possibly find)

1 Cup Light Brown Sugar

1 (7oz) Container Marshmallow Fluff

1 (5oz) Can Evaporated Milk

6 Tablespoons Butter, unsalted

1/2 Teaspoon Salt

1 (12oz) Bag White Chocolate Chips

1 Cup Pecans, chopped

1 Teaspoon Maple Extract

**Instructions**

1. Cook the bacon, but not too crispy.
2. Add the marshmallow fluff, evaporated milk, butter, brown sugar and salt to a pot and apply medium-high heat until boiling. Time it to boil that way for 5 minutes, stirring often with a whisk.
3. Remove from the heat and add the white chocolate chips. Stir until melted.
4. Add the bacon pieces, chopped pecans and maple extract. Stir well until combined.
5. Line an 8x8"" pan with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Pour the fudge mixture into the pan and spread out evenly with a spatula.
6. Put into the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
7. Once set cut into squares and enjoy!",1468

Sautéed potatoes, grilled aubergine, aromatic lamb bolognese and a thick layer of bechamel sauce. It is the bomb, all your neighbours will be jealous of the aroma escaping your kitchen. Get your ingredients and let's get to the kitchen Chef!

**This recipe makes:** 6 portions

**Preparation time:** 1 hour

**Cooking time:** 1 hour

**Ingredients for the bolognese:**

\* 250g of lamb mince (you can swap for beef or the veg substitute)

\* 2 medium-sized onions

\* 4 garlic cloves

\* a glass of red wine

\* 4tbsp of tomato puree

\* cube of beef stock

\* 1/4tsp of cinnamon

\* 1 clove, grounded

\* 1 allspice berry, grounded

\* 1tsp oregano

\* 1tsp of sugar

\* olive oil

\* salt and black pepper to taste

**Ingredients for the bechamel sauce:**

\* 500ml of milk

\* 70g of butter

\* 70g plain flour

\* pinch of nutmeg

\* 30g of parmesan cheese (plus another 30g for the topping)

\* 1 egg yolk

\* salt and black pepper to taste

**Other ingredients:**

\* 2 medium-large potatoes, sliced lengthways

\* 2 large aubergines, sliced lengthways

\* olive oil

\* few tbsp of balsamic glaze (you can also combine honey and balsamic vinegar)

**Instructions for aubergine:**

1. Preheat the fan oven to 250C, you will also need a couple of oven trays for this.
2. Slice aubergine lengthways, not too thin nor too thick, drizzle with olive oil and balsamic glaze on both sides (aubergine will absorb it very quickly) Season with salt, pepper and oregano.
3. Roast for around 15 minutes and remove from the oven. Set aside to cool.

**Instructions for the bolognese:**

1. Preheat the frying pan with a little bit of oil, bring it close to the smoking point, add the lamb mince and let it brown on one side before mixing it and cooking through. Next transfer to the master pot.
2. Now, using the same pan, fry diced onions, you want them to soften and brown slightly, next add minced garlic, cook for a couple more minutes and transfer to the master pot.
3. To your master pot, add red wine, tomato puree, grounded spices, sugar and the beef stock cube and cook for 10 minutes.
4. At this stage check the seasoning, find a balance between sweet and sour, and add a touch more sugar or a little bit of lemon juice if necessary. Salt and pepper to your taste.
5. Cook the bolognese until nice and thick when ready set aside for the later assembly.

**Instructions for the potatoes:**

1. In a frying pan medium heat a little bit of olive oil, lay the sliced potatoes at the bottom of the pan to cover it, fry for a few minutes until starting to brown then flip them to the other side. You may need to do this in two or three batches.

**Instructions for the bechamel sauce:**

1. Pour milk into a medium-sized pan and heat gently on medium heat.
2. In the small frying pan, melt the butter and add plain flour, combine and cook for a minute or so, once the roux is ready add it to the hot milk whisking straight away and keep the heat on low.
3. Bechamel will start to thicken, continue whisking and when no lumps are present whisk in one egg yolk or two if you are rich.
4. Swap whisk for the spoon as it will be very thick, add grated parmesan cheese, nutmeg, salt and black pepper to your taste.

**Assembling and Baking Moussaka:**

1. Preheat the fan oven to 160C.
2. On this occasion I prepare my Moussaka in a cast iron pan, feel free to use a casserole dish or baking pan if you want to.
3. Layer potatoes first, season them with a little bit of salt while doing so.
4. Next, add one layer of aubergine, then top with all the bolognese mix.
5. Cover with another layer of aubergine and spread bechamel on the top, add grated parmesan cheese, oregano and black pepper.
6. Bake for 1h, eat straight away!

2022-04-22,39,"Pork Ham 17,6 lbs in the oven","Destiny_town","Hi friends! Another recipe for meat lovers. This time a ham weighing 17,6 lbs.

**Ingredients**

* Pork ham with skin  17,6 lbs
* Salt  3-5 tablespoons
* Ground coriander  2-3 tablespoons
* Rosemary  2 sprigs
* Light beer  300 ml
* Sunflower oil  50 ml

We also need: Foil, baking paper and gastronorm container.

**Cooking**

1. Clean the skin with a knife or a metal sponge. And if there are stamps on the skin, then it is better to cut them off.
2. Now cut the skin with a mesh. Into small squares of 0,4-0,6 inches. With a knife, cut not only the skin, but also cut it 0,4 inches deep. Then we pierce the meat with a knife, but not through.
3. Salt, carefully rub with coriander, let stand for 20-30 minutes and then pour beer, well, from all sides.
4. Grease with sunflower oil, cover with a film and put in the refrigerator for a day. It is best to marinate on a baking sheet or in gastronorm containers.
5. The ham can be taken out and turned over every 3-4 hours, but this does not give any special changes.
6. In a day. We take out the ham, let it stand warm while we preheat the oven to 400 °F.
7. Line another baking sheet first with foil and then with parchment paper. You need to cover it so that then the ham is completely wrapped in foil and paper. There are a couple of nuances here: the first is that the foil should wrap the ham in two layers; the second  baking paper may be shorter or already the required size, but, its okay, take a stapler and fasten several sheets of baking paper. The main thing is that the fastening seam is on the side, and not from the bottom  so that the juice does not leak out during the cooking process.
8. Foil and paper were laid, put two sprigs of rosemary, a ham was placed on them, poured with marinade.
9. Pack it in paper first, and then with foil.
10. Preheated the oven, wrapped the ham, now we put the baking sheet with the ham in the oven.
11. Cook at 400 °F for 2 hours, then reduce the degrees to 350 °F and simmer the ham in the oven for another 2.5 hours.
12. After 2.5 hours, we take out the baking sheet, open the meat, pour it well with the juice formed during the cooking process, and put it back in the oven for 10-15 minutes at 430-440 °F , but with the top open. It is not necessary longer  the crust will turn out tough. Time has passed, take out and enjoy.

Thats all!

Cook with pleasure!

I was never too fond of meatballs until I tried this recipe, it takes a bit of prep but it's well worth it. Now it's a family favorite.

Instructional video for my [meatball recipe here](https://youtu.be/ceUqCCLAnLY)

**INGREDIENTS**

**For the meatballs**
* 500g pork mince




* 500g beef mince


* Salt


* 100g good quality bead (sourdough, ciabatta etc) crusts removed


* 100ml milk 


* 1 beaten egg

 
* 50g parmesan (plus extra to serve)


* 1 handful of chopped parsley (plus extra to serve) 


* 1 pinch of nutmeg


* 1 tbsp dried oregano


* 6 cloves of garlic


* Salt and pepper


**For the sauce**
* Olive oil

* 4 cloves garlic, slices

* 1 cup red wine

* 1 tbsp red wine vinegar

* 3 tins chopped tomatoes

* Salt and pepper


**STEPS**

1. Season the pork and beef with salt and combine. Set aside and in a separate bowl combine the milk and bread.
2. Leave to rest for 30 minutes.
3. Add the bread/milk mixture to the meat along with the remaining meatball ingredients. Season well and combine.
4. Form into meatballs, I like them somewhere between a golf ball and tennis ball in size, then refrigerate for 1 hour.
5. When ready to cook, heat the olive oil in a pan and cook in batches then set aside.
6. In the same pan, add the remaining oil and fry off the garlic for 1-2 minutes.
7. Add the wine and vinegar to the pan and make sure you scrape the pan to release all of the charred meatball juice.
8. Add the tomatoes, season well and leave to simmer for 10 minutes.
9. Return the meatballs to the pan and continue to simmer for at least 20 minutes.
10. Serve with homemade pasta, chopped parsley and parmasan.

**TIPS**
* The fattier your meat the better it will taste - we're not here to lose weight. I used 20% fat beef and 12% fat pork.


* Meatballs can be made the day before and left in the fridge.


* The more browning you get on your meatballs and in the pan the better your sauce will taste.


* The longer you simmer the sauce before adding the meatballs the thicker and richer it will become.",2047

### Equipment

* Wide pot

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 3 pound chuck roast trimmed and cut into bite-sized cubes
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 1 tablespoon chili powder I used a mix of silk chili, chili powder, and black Urfa chili
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon ground black lime optional
* 89 cups water or beef stock
* 8 ounces dry beans rinsed, or use 2 15ounce canned beans
* 1 teaspoon chocolate miso plus more to taste, if you like or use red or white miso
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Pickled Charred Corn:

* 2 ears of corn husked and kernels cut from the cob
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 shallot peeled and thinly sliced
* S cup water
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 2 tablespoons fruit and flower vinegar or use distilled white vinegar
* Flaky sea salt

#### For serving:

* Microgreens, cilantro, or minced scallions

### Instructions

#### Brown the beef:

* Pat the beef dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a wide, large pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef in batches, and cook in an even layer for 35 minutes without moving the beef. Flip once a golden crust has formed and brown the other side. Continue cooking until well-browned all over. Transfer to a plate and leave the fond and rendered fat in the pot.

#### Cook the aromatics:

* Add the diced onion to the pot and cook for 78 minutes until it begins to soften and brown. Next, add the chili powder, paprika, cumin, and ground black lime. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

#### Simmer the chili:

* Return the beef to the pot. Pour in 8 cups of cooking liquid (water or beef stock) and add the dry beans. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 2 hours. Stir the chili periodically and add more liquid if needed. Remove the lid and continue simmering for 12 hours more or until the beans are cooked through and the beef is tender and falling aparttaste and season once more to your preferences.
* Scoop out 1/2 cup of the liquid from the chili. Whisk in the chocolate miso until completely melted and incorporated into the liquid. Pour the mixture back into the chili and stir to combine.

#### Prepare the pickled corn:

* Place the corn kernels on a baking sheet in an even layer. Drizzle with the oil and sprinkle with salt. Place directly under a broiler, turning occasionally until the corn chars. You may hear popping as the corn cooks. Depending on your broiler, this will take 4-8 minutes. Turn the corn regularly to prevent it from burning!
* While the corn chars, place the vinegar, sugar, and water in a heatproof glass measuring cup and microwave for 1-2 minutes or until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stir to incorporate.
* Place the shallot in a bowl or mason jar and add the charred corn. Pour the hot water mixture over the vegetables and toss to incorporate completelyseason with a sprinkle of flaky sea salt. Transfer to the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.

#### To serve:

* Spoon the chili into bowls and pile the pickled corn on top. Serve with microgreens, if you like. Enjoy!

2022-04-17,42,"Polish {urek with Rye Sourdough Bread","mienczaczek","{urek is a traditional Polish soup and truly one of my favourites on the Easter holiday table. Prepared in many varieties that differ across Poland and every household. The flavour is complex and unique, thanks to the fermented Rye starter that works as the main ingredient. Once you try it you will love it just like I do :)

**How to prepare {urek?**

First of all, to make {urek you need to prepare the starter, it is simple and it doesn't require maintenance but it takes 5-7 days to ferment. You can also buy the premade version in European supermarkets but the flavour will not be as good as a homemade version.

This recipe makes 6 portions

**Ingredients for the starter:**

\* 500ml (0.52 quart) bottled or boiled water at room temperature (no chlorine)

\* 5tbsp rye flour (you can use wholemeal wheat flour as well)

\* 5 garlic cloves, peeled and slightly crushed

\* 4 bay leaves

\* 10 allspice berries

**Ingredients for the soup:**

\* 1,5 litre (1.58 quart) of vegetable bullion

\* 500ml (0.52 quart) of {urek starter

\* 4 small pork sausages (you can also add smoked sausage)

\* 250g (8.8oz) uncut smoked bacon (boczek)

\* 1tsp marjoram

\* 3 tsp of double cream (soured cream works too)

\* Salt to taste

**To serve:**

\* Boiled diced potatoes

\* Hard-boiled eggs cut in half

\* Sourdough Bread

\* Fresh parsley or dill

\* Cracked black pepper

**Instructions for the starter:**

1. For the preparation of the starter, you need to use water without chlorine as it kills the microbes, simply boil the water first and let it cool down to room temperature.
2. Put all the starter ingredients into a clean jar and stir with a spoon to combine.
3. Cover the jar with a paper towel or a cloth and tie the top (this helps the starter to breathe).
4. Place the jar at room temperature away from the direct sunlight. After around 5-7 days your starter is ready to use. You can use it straight away or store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks (if you keep it in the fridge remove and discard spices from the starter, if you use it straight away you can add it as it is).

**Instructions for the bullion:**

1. To Prepare vegetable bullion combine 1L of water with a couple of diced carrots, 2 medium onions, a piece of celery and leek. Bring to the boil then reduce to simmer with a lid on the pot, set the timer for 1 hour.
2. Once the bullion is ready, separate the liquid from the vegetables (I keep carrots for the soup and discard everything else).

**Instructions for the soup:**

1. Dice bacon and pan-fry on high heat for 4-5 minutes to render the fat.
2. To the hot stock add fried bacon, cooked carrots, whole or sliced sausages, 1tsp of marjoram and bring to boil then simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Whisk Zurek starter and pour into the soup, simmer until soup thickens.
4. Take the soup off the heat and remove the sausages, slice and place back in the pot.
5. Put the cream in the bowl and add a ladle of the soup, mix it together and pour it back into the pot (this prevents the cream from curdling).
6. Serve {urek with hard-boiled eggs and fresh sourdough bread.

Smacznego!

**Insight:**

\- You can add 1tbsp of grated horseradish to the soup, it works fantastic.

* 4 quarts of chicken stock

* 2 teaspoons parsley (fresh is best)
* 1 pre-washed bag of spinach
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons pepper
* 1 box ditalini or pastina noodles

# Instructions

1. Either use chicken bullion cubes and water, or premade chicken stock from the store.
2. Add chicken stock to a large pot at high heat.
3. In another medium sized pot bring water to a boil - this will be for the noodles.
4. Whisk about 4-6 eggs in a measuring cup - you will want a spout, or a square Tupperware container for easy pouring. Set to the side.
5. Put 0.50 teaspoons of salt into a glass cereal bowl and crush with the flat side of a spoon. The finer the salt the better. Set aside.
6. You want the chicken stock to get very hot but not boiling, so lower the heat to medium when the time is right. When its ready stir the broth into a good whirlpool.
7. Slowly pour the whisked eggs into the soup. You want little ribbons of egg to be swirling around.
8. Now add large handfuls of spinach, a couple healthy pinches of parsley, a very healthy teaspoon of garlic powder, about 0.25 cups of parmesan, and sprinkle in your finely crushed salt.
9. Stir and let the spinach cook for about 15 minutes.
10. Drain your noodles and serve the soup over some noodles in a bowl.

# Advice from Grandma

Keep your noodles in a container, you may add them to the soup, but if you like al dente noodles then you can keep them refrigerated until your next meal and enjoy the same deliciousness again.",1557

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, please visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/](https://maplewoodroad.com/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 10 lb pre-cooked ham (approximate weight)
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1 c brown sugar, packed
* ¼ c honey
* 1 tablespoon brown mustard
* ½ c pineapple juice
* ¼ c apple juice
* ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon ground cloves  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
2. Unwrap the ham and place it in a large baking dish. I also decided to pour all the juices from the bag in the dish, to help keep it juicy.
3. If you have a spiral-cut ham, theres nothing else to do. Otherwise, make ¼3 deep cuts in a diamond pattern all over the ham surface (this will allow the juices from the brown sugar ham glaze to drip down inside later).
4. Place in the oven and bake.
5. A ham will take about 1 to 1-½ hours to cook through. After 1 hour, check the temperature by inserting a meat thermometer in the thickest part (being careful not to touch the bone). The ham is ready when the internal temperature has reached 130°F.
6. At about the 1-hour mark, start making the brown sugar ham glaze.
7. Melt butter in a small pan over medium heat. 
8. Once the butter has melted, add all the other ingredients and whisk together.
9. Bring to a simmer, whisking occasionally, and cook for about 5 minutes. 
10. Immediately remove from heat and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes.
11. Check the internal temperature of your ham (the ham is finished cooking when it has reached 130°F).
12. When its getting close to that point, but has about a half hour left, baste half of the brown sugar ham glaze onto the ham. 
13. Fifteen minutes later, brush on the remaining ham glaze and let the ham finish cooking until it has reached 130°F.

Chicken Florentine is usually made with a mornay sauce which is bechamel with cheese. I skipped the cheese because its already quite rich but you could definitely grate some cheese in there if you like!

### Ingredients

* 3 chicken breasts cut in half lengthwise
* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour divided
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* ½ teaspoon paprika
* ¼ teaspoon cayenne powder
* 4 tablespoons butter divided
* 2 tablespoons neutral oil plus more if needed
* 1 yellow onion peeled and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 1 pound cherry tomatoes
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 2 cups water or chicken stock
* ½ cup heavy cream
* 5 ounces baby spinach
* ½ lemon juiced plus additional lemon wedges for garnish
* S cup fresh parsley minced or use fresh basil if you prefer
* 16 ounces penne pasta

### Instructions

#### Preheat the oven to 400ºF.

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Reserve ¼ cup of the pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.

#### Prepare the chicken:

* Pat the chicken dry and set aside.
* In a shallow bowl, combine 1 cup of flour, salt, pepper, dry thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne powder, and stir. Dredge the chicken in the flour and shake off the excess.
* Add the oil to a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add 2 tablespoons of butter. Once the butter is frothy, add the chicken. Cook the chicken in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding the pan. Fry the chicken for 5 minutes per side and transfer to a plate. They do not need to be cooked through!

#### Prepare the sauce:

* Add more oil, if needed, to the same wide pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook for 5 minutes. Next, add cherry tomatoes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Once the cherry tomatoes begin to blisterabout 5 minutes lateradd two more tablespoons of butter. Once the butter is frothy, add the minced garlic, dry thyme, and crushed red pepper.
* Next, stir in 2 tablespoons flour and cook it into the tomatoes for 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in half of the water or stock. Add the remaining water or stock and whisk until completely smooth. Pour in the heavy cream and whisk until smooth. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and let it bubble over the stovetop for 5 minutes. Taste and season the sauce to your preferences. Turn off the heat.

#### Bake the chicken:

* Stir the spinach into the sauce. Place the chicken on top and bake it for 10 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165ºF.

#### Finish the pasta:

* Remove the pot from the oven and transfer the cooked chicken to a plate. Add the lemon juice and cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat. If needed, add the pasta cooking water to loosen up the sauce. Finally, stir in the minced parsley or basiltaste and season once more to your preferences.

#### To serve:

* Divide the pasta between shallow bowls and place a chicken breast on each dish. Garnish with more parsley or basil if you like, and serve with lemon wedges on the side. Enjoy!

Making the Dough Starter

Ingredients 

- 6 tbsp milk (89 ml)

- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour (16 g)

Directions 

1. Over medium heat, stir together milk and flour in a saucepan until a thick paste forms, about one minute. 

2. Remove from heat and place starter inside a small bowl. Cover and chill starter down to room temperature while you put together the rest of the dough.

Making the Hot Dog Buns

Ingredients

- 1 cup milk (237 ml)

- 1 tbsp active-dry yeast (10 g)

- 4 tbsp granulated white sugar (50 g)

- 3 and 1/8 cup flour (390 g)

- 1 tsp salt (6 g)

- 1 large egg + 1 additional egg for egg wash

- 4 tbsp melted butter (57 g)

- 1 tsp vanilla

- 9 hot dogs

- sesame seeds (optional)

- flaky sea salt (optional)

- 2 tbsp honey for glazing (42 g)

Directions

1. Heat milk in the microwave until it reaches 100 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 43 degrees Celsius). Stir in yeast and sugar and let sit to bloom for 10 minutes.

2. Meanwhile combine flour and salt in a separate bowl.

3. In a larger bowl, combine egg, melted butter, vanilla, chilled starter, and bloomed yeast mixture. Mix until smooth.

4. Then add flour and salt mixture. Using a mixer with a dough hook, knead dough for about 6-8 minutes on medium-low speed, or until you get a smooth, supple dough. A sign you are done kneading is if it passes the windowpane test  taking a small piece of dough, slowly stretch it into a thin sheet between your fingers and see if light can pass through the dough without it tearing in the process. Avoid over-kneading. You can knead by hand, but it may take several minutes longer.

5. After kneading, place dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with a towel to let rise until doubled in size, about 45-60 minutes.

6. Once risen, roll out the dough on a floured surface using a floured rolling pin. To avoid sticking, you may need to flour the dough slightly as well. Roll until you form a square about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in thickness.

7. Using a knife or bench scraper, cut the dough into 9 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough between your hands and the floured surface into a thin, long rope shape, about 10-12 inches (25-30 cm) long. Wind each rope of dough around a hot dog so it covers the entire length.

8. Space dough-wrapped hot dogs on parchment lined baking sheets about 2 inches (5 cm) apart and cover with a towel to allow to rise one more time (20-30 minutes).

9. Meanwhile, pre-heat your oven to 350° F (177° C).

10. After the second rise, brush the top and sides of your buns with an egg wash made from a beaten egg thinned out with a tablespoon of water. Sprinkle buns with sesame seeds and flaky sea salt if using.

11. Bake for 17-20 minutes, or until buns are golden-brown and no longer doughy on the inside.

12. Place honey in a small bowl and microwave for 10 seconds just to loosen up. Lightly brush buns with honey to add shine and a subtle sweetness.

Making the Choux Pastry (Dough)

Ingredients

- 1 cup water (237 ml)

- 1/2 cup butter (113 g)

- 2 tsp sugar

- 1/2 tsp salt

- 1 cup flour (125 g)

- 3 to 4 large eggs + 1 additional beaten egg for an egg wash

Directions

1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine water, butter, sugar, and salt, stirring with a wooden spoon occasionally. You can chop the butter into smaller pieces beforehand so it melts faster.

2. Once mixture comes to a rolling boil, take it off the heat and stir in flour to incorporate.

3. Place back onto medium heat and stir dough continuously for about 1 to 2 minutes. You should see the dough start to pull away from the sides of the saucepan and a film of residue form at the bottom.

4. Turn off the heat and set aside the saucepan to allow the dough to cool, about 10 minutes.

5. Add in eggs one at a time, stirring with a wooden spoon to fully incorporate in between each egg. After the third egg, test the dough with the V-test. Scoop up some of the dough with a wooden spoon and let the dough drape down vertically. If the dough drapes down in a V-shape, then it passes the test. If it does not, then whisk the fourth egg in a separate bowl and add little by little to the dough until it passes the test. 

6. Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius).

7. Transfer dough to a piping bag fitted with a large French star tip. Alternatively, you can use a large round tip or simply snip off the end of a piping or Ziploc bag.

8. Line baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment. If using parchment, pipe a small bit of dough underneath the paper in the corners so it lies flat while baking.

9. Pipe your dough onto your lined baking sheets, about 3/4 inch (2 cm) in width and 4 inches (10 cm) in length. Space piped dough an inch (2.5 cm) apart because they will expand in the oven.

10. Brush your piped dough with an egg wash. This can come from an entirely new egg or if you have part of an egg leftover from making the dough, you can use that for the egg wash.

11. Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius) to allow pastry to rise and brown. Then lower temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) to continue to cook through on the inside, about 25 minutes more.

12. After baking, set aside pastry to cool completely on a cooling rack. Prick three holes in the bottom of your eclairs to allow steam to escape. These holes will also be where you pipe in the filling.

Making the Pastry Cream Filling

Ingredients

- 1 cup milk (237 ml)

- 3 large egg yolks

- 3 tbsp sugar (38 g)

- 2 tbsp cornstarch (15 g)

- 3 ounces chopped white chocolate (85 g)

- 1 tsp vanilla

- 1/4 tsp cinnamon

- 1/2 tbsp butter (7 g)

- 3/4 cup heavy cream (177 ml)

Directions

1. Heat milk to a simmer in a pot over medium heat.

2. Meanwhile, whisk together egg yolks, sugar, and cornstarch until smooth, pale, and light yellow.

3. Once at a simmer, slowly pour milk into egg yolk mixture while whisking.

4. Then return milk and egg mixture to the pot over medium heat. Continuously stir for several minutes until mixture thickens. You should be able to run a spatula through the mixture and along the bottom of the pot and leave a clean line.

5. Turn off the heat and stir in white chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, and butter until melted. If there are still unmelted pieces of white chocolate or butter remaining, you can place mixture back onto low heat briefly while stirring until everything is melted and incorporated.

6. Chill the pastry cream in the fridge until cool, about 30 minutes.

7. Whip up heavy cream until thick and you can overturn the bowl without any cream falling out. Remember not to over-whip or go past stiff peaks.

8. Gently fold the whipped cream into your chilled white chocolate pastry cream.

9. Chill in the fridge until ready to use.

Making the White Chocolate Ganache

Ingredients

- 5.3 ounces chopped white chocolate (150 grams)

- 1.8 ounces heavy cream (51 grams)

- dark chocolate (optional for decorating)

Directions

1. In a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water, combine white chocolate and heavy cream.

2. Stir until melted and combined.

3. Set aside ganache to cool.

4. In a separate heatproof bowl, melt a handful of chopped dark chocolate over the same pot of simmering water.

Assembly:

1. Transfer your pastry cream filling to a piping bag fitted with a Bismarck or small round piping tip, and pipe the cream into the holes you made earlier at the bottom of your eclairs. If you do not have a piping tip, you can also slice open your eclairs lengthwise with a knife and add the custard inside with a spoon forming a sandwich.

2. Dip the tops of each eclair with your white chocolate ganache,

3. Drizzle your melted dark chocolate on top using a spoon or piping bag.

4. Enjoy! Eclairs are best enjoyed the day they are made.",5007

**FOR THE MAC**

* 8oz sharp cheddar
* 8oz pepper jack cheese
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) of butter
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1 cup milk
* 1/3 cup Franks Red Hot
* 1 lbs macaroni pasta  


**FOR THE CRISPY CHICKEN**

* 1/2 lbs chicken (tenders ideally)
* 1 1/2 cup flour
* 2 eggs
* 1 1/2 cup bread crumbs
* 1/2 to 1 cup of Franks Red Hot (depending on how saucy you want your chicken)

  
**GARNISH**

* green onions
* ranch (or blue cheese, whatever you prefer)

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTIONS**  


1. To prep, grate your cheese and set aside. 
2. Create the wells to bread your chicken - one with flour, one with your whisked eggs, and one with your breadcrumbs. Season to your taste. Bread your chicken strips by tossing them in the flour, then coating in the egg, then coating in your bread crumbs. 
3. Take your breaded strips and air fry (or regular fry) for 10-12 minutes @ 400F. Set aside in a warm place once they're done cooking. 
4. Go ahead and cook your pasta according to the boxed instructions. Salt your pasta water. I personally cook them slightly under as they will continue cooking in the sauce &amp; when we bake our mac. Set aside 1/4 cup of your salted pasta water, strain. 
5. To make the cheese sauce, begin by melting your butter in a large oven safe pan. Once melted, add your flour. Mix until lumpy. Looks gross, but the butter flour lumps mean you're doing it right! Pour in your pasta water, Franks &amp; milk, stir to combine until smooth. 
6. Once smooth, add your cheeses. Reserve roughly 1 cup of cheese, this will be baked on top. Stir until silky and velvety, then mix in your cooked pasta. 
7. Once pasta and cheese is combined harmoniously, top with additional breadcrumbs and the remainder of cheese. Broil in the oven for 2-4 minutes, keeping a close eye on it. Remove once surface is a nice golden brown. 
8. Back to your chicken tenders, chop them up and toss them in Franks Red Hot. Add your ranch drizzle, an additional Franks drizzle, and top with your coated chopped chicken. Top with green onions.

Note: This is a vegan recipe though you can easily swap the vegan butter for dairy butter if you like!

### Ingredients

* 4 tablespoons vegan butter divided
* 1 pound mixed mushrooms torn or sliced depending on the variety
* 1 stalk green garlic or 8 cloves garlic minced
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 ½ cups arborio rice
* 67 cups warm water or vegetable stock
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### For serving, optional:

* ½ lemon juiced
* ½ cup loosely packed parsley minced

### Instructions

#### Brown the mushrooms:

* Melt two tablespoons of vegan butter into a wide pot. Once frothy, add the mushrooms and cook until all of the liquid releases and evaporates. Depending on the size of your pot, you may need to cook the mushrooms in batches. Depending on the mushroom variety, this will take anywhere from 1820 minutes.
* Continue cooking until the mushrooms crisp up and take on a deep, golden color. If you cooked the mushrooms in batches, add all of them back to the pot and season with salt and pepper.

#### Cook the garlic:

* Next, add the minced green garlic or garlic cloves to the cooked mushrooms along with the dry thyme and cook until just fragrant.

#### Prepare the risotto:

* Add the arborio rice to the pot of mushrooms and cook until it toasts slightly, about 2 minutes.
* Begin adding the warm liquid in 1-cup increments, agitating the rice, and adding more liquid only after the rice has absorbed all the liquid in the pot. You'll need 5 to 7 cups and about 40 minutes of regular stirring. Turn off the heat once the risotto takes on a creamy texture and the rice is al dente. If using water, season the risotto liberally with salt and pepper. If using vegetable stock, you may not need as much salt.
* Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.
* Let the risotto rest off the heat for five minutes.

#### Finish the risotto:

* Stir the juice from half a lemon into the risotto if you like. Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon wedges from the other half of the lemon. Enjoy!

Making the Macaron Shells

Ingredients:

- 80 g almond flour

- 60 g pistachio flour

- 130 g powdered sugar

- 100 g room temperature egg whites (about 3 large eggs)

- Pinch of salt

- 1/4 tsp lemon juice (or white vinegar or cream of tartar)

- 90 g granulated sugar

- 1/2 tsp vanilla

- Few drops of green gel food coloring

Directions:

1. In a food processor, add in your almond flour, pistachio flour, and powdered sugar. Process until very fine, about 30 seconds. Then sift into a large bowl.

2. Add your room temperature egg whites with a pinch of salt in a separate bowl and start beating on low speed. Once foamy, add in your lemon juice and gradually start adding in your sugar, about a few teaspoons at a time. As you add in more and more sugar, you can gradually increases the speed of the mixer and continue to beat the egg whites until you get stiff peaks. Your peaks are stiff enough when you can overturn the bowl and nothing falls out.

3. Add in your vanilla and food coloring and mix in just to combine on low speed.

4. Fold a 1/3 of your dry ingredients into the meringue.

5. Gently fold in the rest of the dry ingredients and continue folding until the batter passes the figure 8 test. For this test, scoop up some of the batter with a rubber spatula and let it slowly flow off back into the bowl. If a continuous figure 8 can be drawn with the batter, you are done mixing. If the flow of the batter breaks during the figure 8 test, continue mixing until it passes.

6. Place your batter in a piping bag with a standard round piping tip and begin piping one inch circular dollops onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat. If using parchment, pipe a little bit of batter in the corners of the paper to keep it flat.

7. Tap your trays of piped macaron batter a few times on the counter to release air bubbles and let them rest for about 40 minutes to an hour. After resting, a skin should have formed on your dollops of macarons, enough that you can gently touch the macaron dollops without leaving an indent. Meanwhile, pre-heat your oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (148 degrees Celsius).

8. Bake for 12-15 minutes. Then allow to completely cool before removing from the tray. Your macarons are perfectly baked if they peel cleanly off the parchment or mat. You are now ready to make the buttercream and start filling.

Making the Pistachio Swiss Meringue Buttercream

Ingredients: 

- 60 grams egg whites (about 2 egg whites)

- 100 grams sugar (1/2 cup)

- pinch of salt

- 1/4 tsp lemon juice (or white vinegar or cream of tartar)

- 127 grams butter (10 tbsp)

- 42 grams pistachio butter (about 3 tablespoons or to taste)

- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:

1. Separate your egg whites from the yolks, making sure not a single drop of yolk ends up in the whites. Place your egg whites in a heatproof bowl such as metal. Reserve yolks for another purpose.

2. Add in the sugar and set the bowl over a pot that is simmering with a couple inches of water.

3. Whisk the egg whites and sugar constantly until all the sugar is dissolved. You can use your fingers to feel if there are still granules of sugar in the egg mixture. Then take it off the pot.

4. Add in your salt and lemon juice. Then on medium-high speed, beat the mixture until it reaches stiff peaks. You know you have reached this stage when you can overturn the bowl and none of the meringue falls out. Avoid over-beating.

5. Add in your softened butter about a tablespoon at a time, making sure you mix in between each tablespoon. 

6. Mix in your vanilla and pistachio paste.

Assembly:

1. Pair up macaron shells of similar size.

2. Pipe a dollop of the buttercream onto the flat side of one of the macaron shells and then top with the other, forming a sandwich.",3916

Making the Dough Starter

Ingredients

- 4 tbsp milk (60 ml)
- 4 tsp all-purpose flour (10 g)

Directions

1. Over medium heat, stir together milk and flour in a saucepan until a thick paste forms, about one minute.

2. Remove from heat and place inside a small bowl. Chill starter while you put together the rest of the dough.

Making the Dough

Ingredients

- 2/3 cup milk (158 ml)

- 2 tsp active-dry yeast (7 g)

- 3 tbsp sugar (37 g)

- 2 3/8 cups all-purpose flour (300 g)

- 3/4 tsp salt (4 g)

- 1 medium egg

- 3 tbsp melted butter (42 g)

- 1 tsp vanilla (4 g)

- oil for frying

Directions

1. Heat milk in the microwave to 100 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 43 degrees Celsius). Stir in yeast and sugar and let sit to bloom for 10 minutes.

2. Meanwhile combine flour and salt in a separate bowl.

3. In a larger bowl, combine egg, melted butter, vanilla, chilled starter, and bloomed yeast mixture. Mix until smooth.

4. Then add flour and salt mixture. Using a mixer with a dough hook, knead dough for about 3-4 minutes on medium-low speed until you get a smooth, supple dough. Avoid overworking the dough. You can knead by hand, but it may take a couple minutes longer.

5. After kneading, place dough in a greased bowl covered with a towel to let rise until doubled in size, about 45-60 minutes (I make the custard filling and chocolate glaze during this time).

6. Once risen, roll out the dough on a floured surface using a floured rolling pin. To avoid sticking, you may need to flour the dough slightly as well. Roll out to 1/2 inch in thickness.

7. Then using a 3.5 inch ring cutter (or similarly sized glass cup), cut out your donuts. Lay cut-out donuts on a tray or cooking rack. You can re-roll any scraps.

8. Cover cut-out donuts with a towel to rise one more time (about 15-20 minutes).

9. Fill large pot with a couple inches of oil. Heat oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).

10. After they finish rising, fry donuts in the oil, about a minute to 90 seconds on each side. I fry donuts about two at a time while carefully monitoring and adjusting the heat to stay around 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Lay fried donuts on a rack to let excess oil drip off.

Making the Custard Filling

Ingredients

- 1 cup milk (237 ml)

- 3 egg yolks

- 1/4 cup sugar (50 g)

- 2 tbsp cornstarch (15 g)

- 1/2 tbsp butter (7 g)

- 1 tsp vanilla (4 g)

Directions

1. Heat milk to a simmer in a pot over medium heat.

2. Meanwhile, whisk together egg yolks, sugar, and cornstarch.

3. Once at a simmer, slowly pour milk into egg yolk mixture while whisking.

4. Then return milk and egg mixture to the pot over medium heat. Continuously stir for several minutes until mixture thickens. You should be able to run a spatula through the mixture and along the bottom of the pot and leave a clean line.

5. Once thickened, add vanilla and butter. Stir to combine.

6. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap so that it touches the custard. Chill in the fridge until ready to use.

Making the Chocolate Glaze

Ingredients

- 2/3 cup powdered sugar (86 g)

- 2 tbsp cocoa powder (14 g)

- 2 tbsp water (30 ml)

- 1/2 tbsp melted butter or coconut oil (7 g)

- 1/2 tsp corn syrup or honey (3 g)

- 1/4 tsp vanilla (1 g)

Directions

1. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and whisk until smooth. If mixture is too thick, thin out with more water. It should be spreadable but not runny. 

Assembly:

1. Using a piping bag with a Bismarck piping tip, fill cooled donuts with chilled custard filling.

2. Lastly, dip donuts in chocolate glaze.

3. Enjoy! Donuts are best served the day they are made.",3723

**Introduction**

Tarte Tatin is an upside down pastry dish traditionally made using apples but I've use plums here for a sweet, jammy dessert.

There's an instructional video [here](https://youtu.be/Xe2UkwVKCQc) if you'd like to watch.

**Ingredients**

* 75g Sugar
* 40g Butter
* 300g Plums - halved and de-stoned
* 1 sheet shop bought puff pastry.

**Instructions**

1. Melt the sugar over a medium heat in an oven safe until it begins to caramelize. Dont stir it but give the pan a shake every once in a while.
2. When the sugar has melted, turn off the heat and add the butter. Use a wooden spoon to mix in but be careful, the mixture will be VERY hot.
3. When the butter and sugar is combined, add the fruit cut side down and leave to cool for about 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, roll out the pastry slightly and cut around a dinnerplate thats a similar size to the pan and gently lay the pastry over the plums, tucking the edges under with a blunt knife. 
5. Give the pastry a few pricks and bake in the oven at 200C for 25-30 minutes until golden brown.
6. Remove from the oven, allow to cool for a couple of minutes and then loosen the edges before flipping onto a plate. 
7. Serve with cream and enjoy.

  
**Tips**

* Can be made with apples or apricots. 
* Eat warm but the topping will set as it cools so if its too damp when turned you might want to leave for a little while.",1393

To make your own Cinnabon Delights at home, you'll need...  


**FOR THE DONUTS**

* 1 1/2 cups of flour
* 1/4 white sugar
* 2 teaspoons of baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon of salt
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup milk
* 2 tablespoons melted butter
* oil for deep frying (we used canola)
* cinnamon sugar

**FOR THE FILLING**

* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 1/3 cup cream cheese, softened
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/4 cup milk

  
**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Whisk together all donut dry ingredients in a large bowl, then stir in melted butter, egg and milk. This will make your batter.
2.  Heat your frying oil to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Roll the batter into circle shapes and drop into the hot oil, frying for about 4 minutes total. Make sure to flip the donuts halfway through so they cook evenly. (Dont be like us and cook your dough in oil that is too hot, or youll have a raw center.)
3. Remove donuts from the oil using a slotted spoon to drain some of the excess oil, and then toss into your cinnamon sugar mixture making sure to evenly coat the whole donut. Allow to cool on a cooling rack while you prepare the filling.  

4. For your filling, whip together the softened cream cheese and vanilla until smooth, and then add in the powdered sugar a little at a time until fully combined. Add milk to the mixture until you reach an ideal creamy consistency. 
5. Pour the filling into a piping bag or ziploc bag with the corner cut off, so you can fill the donuts. Poke a hole into the side of the donut so that you can fill with the cream cheese filling, be sure to move the tip of the piping bag around as you fill the donut to make sure the filling is distributed throughout the center of the donut. As extra help, you can puncture your donut with a chopstick and move it around to make space for the filling before piping it.

2. While the pasta is boiling, toast the Black Pepper in a skillet over low heat until you can smell the pepper.  Then add 1/2 cup of water to the skillet to stop the cooking process.
3.  take 2 Tbsp. of Pasta water and add it to the grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and mix to create a fluffy paste.  Add an additional spoonful of water at a time if needed in-between mixing.  Add a little pepper water from the skillet and mix.  This tempers the cheese, so it's less likely to separate in the pan when combined with pasta.
4. Once the pasta is Al Dente, do not strain it, add it directly to the skill with the pepper water mixture, and gently combine.
5. Turn off the heat on the skillet, and add the cheese paste, and gently stir to until the cheese melts and a sauce forms.  Add more pasta water if as needed to keep the sauce creamy and pasta separate.

Notes

§	CARAMELIZATION: Toss the cauliflower well in the oil mixture to ensure it roasts evenly in the oven. TIP: Dont overcrowd the pan as this will result in vegetables that steam. The key trick is to give them enough space on the pan to allow air to circulate and to crisp it.

§	EXTRA CRISPY: Turn the oven to high broil and broil the tops to the desired texture. Flip them over to crisp the other side as well.

§	REHEATING: Place florets on baking sheet. Reheat in 300°F oven for 5-7 minutes or until heated through. Alternatively, reheat in the microwave or a skillet on the stovetop.

§	STORING: Store in container in refrigerator for 2-3 days.",1436

**FOR THE SHOYU EGGS:**

* 3 eggs
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 2 tbsp water

&amp;#x200B;

**FOR THE BROTH:**

* 1 cup soy milk
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 8 oz shitake mushrooms
* fresh ginger &amp; garlic, a decent sized root &amp; roughly 5 cloves
* 1/2 cup white miso paste
* 2 tbsp chili paste
* 2 tbsp peanut butter (but tahini works even better!)

&amp;#x200B;

**FOR THE CHICKEN KATSU:**

* 1 cup flour
* 2 cups of panko
* 1-2 large eggs
* 8-12oz chicken thighs, boneless
* 2-3 tbsp gochujang
* 2-3 tbsp soy sauce
* 2-3 tbsp honey

&amp;#x200B;

**ETC:**

* noodles, of course (instant ramen noodles are just fine)
* green onions for garnish
* nori (seaweed sheets) for garnish

&amp;#x200B;

1. STARTING WITH THE SHOYU EGGS, combine your sugar, water, and soy sauce in a pot. Heat on low until you see the sugar has completely dissolved. Set aside in a small container.
2. Place your 3 eggs in a small pot with water coming over them by about a half inch. Bring to a gentle boil, and cook for 5-6 minutes for a nice, soft boiled egg. Place them in an ice bath for 10 minutes, peel, and place in the container with your sweetened soy mixture. Let sit in the fridge for 3-4 hours, tossing occasionally to coat all sides.
3. FOR THE BROTH, begin by roughly chopping your garlic, ginger, and shitake mushrooms. Sautee them all together in a large pot until fragrant, then add your pastes, milk, and chicken broth. Salt &amp; pepper to taste. Stir until everything is dissolved and cook on low from 1-4 hours. The longer the better!
4. AND FOR THE CHICKEN KATSU, place your flour, panko, and egg wash all in separate bowls. These will be your wells for breading your chicken. Remember to add salt &amp; pepper to your flour and panko.
5. Alternating hands for wet/dry ingredients, place your chicken thighs in the flour to coat, then the egg wash, and then the panko.
6. We double breaded ours to keep crispy integrity in the ramen, simply repeat the egg &amp; panko step to do so.
7. We cooked our chicken in the air fryer @ 375 for 22 minutes.
8. To make your spicy chicken sauce, simply combine the gochujang, honey, and soy sauce together until velvety and smooth. If you'd like a looser sauce, simply add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until its at your desired consistency. Toss cooked chicken in the sauce. Slice into strips.
9. PUTTING TOGETHER THE RAMEN, get your noodles in a bowl and top with your strained ramen broth. Add your nori sheets to the side, nestling your chopped chicken katsu next to it. Gently place your soft boiled shoyu egg next to the chicken, and garnish with green onions. We added an extra teaspoon of chili paste for flavor and color.

Reminisce of your favorite times with Cayde-6. Tell people you aren't crying, its just how spicy the ramen is. Enjoy.

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/lemon-lavender-cookies/](https://maplewoodroad.com/lemon-lavender-cookies/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 c salted butter, at room temperature
* ¾ c powdered sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 tablespoons honey
* 2 teaspoons dried lavender (culinary grade)
* 1 tablespoon lemon zest (about 1 large lemon)
* 2-¼ c all purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* ¼ teaspoon salt  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. First, cream together butter and sugar.
2. Then, add egg, vanilla extract, and honey, and mix well.
3. Using either a mortar and pestle or a food processor, grind together the lemon zest and lavender until the aromas of both ingredients are released through the oils. In a food processor, this will take just a moment, but if using a mortar and pestle, it will take a minute or two.
4. Add the lemon zest/lavender mixture to the bowl with the butter, sugar, egg, vanilla, and honey, and mix until it's evenly distributed throughout.
5. In a separate bowl, stir together the dry ingredients of flour, baking soda, and salt.
6. Add dry to wet ingredients and mix.
7. Form the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about an hour. It will be easier to roll out the dough once it's chilled a bit, plus this chilling helps the cookies keep their shape during baking.
8. Once the dough has chilled for an hour, preheat oven to 350	.
9. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough until it's just slightly less than ¼"" thick.
10. Next, cut out the cookies in any shape you'd like and place on a lined baking sheet.
11. Bake on the center rack of the oven for 10 to 12 minutes. They won't brown like many other cookies and the color actually won't change much, aside from maybe just a little golden hint at the edges.
12. Let cool and enjoy with a hot cup of tea!",1904

Get ready to grab a spoon and dig in, totally safe to eat and you wont be able to put that spoon down! You wont believe how easy it is to make this cookie dough!  
video recipe [here](https://youtu.be/yO2uAJSlwoM)  
**INGREDIENTS**  
\* 2 cups All-purpose flour  
\* 1 cup Cake flour  
\* 1/2 cup Granulated sugar  
\* 1 cup Brown sugar  
\* 1 Cup butter (2 sticks)  
\* 1 cup mini chocolate chips  
\* 3/4 Cup milk, plus more as needed  
\* 2 tsp vanilla extract  
**INSTRUCTIONS**  
Preparing the flour  
1. Add all of the flour to a pan and turn the pan on medium high heat. Using a whisk, start mixing and shaking the pan ever so often.  
2. Continue to roast until the flour is heated through and has darkened ever so slightly. The flour is ready when it smells similar to popcorn and doesn't appear dusty anymore - it should develop some texture. About 12-15 minutes.  
3. Once done, immediately move the pan off the heat. Mix every 2-3 minutes to prevent any residual heat from burning the flour.  
Making the cookie dough  
1. Soften the butter by microwaving for 20-30 seconds on high. In a large bowl, add in the sugars and butter. Start your stand mixer with the paddle attachment and run on medium speed. It will take about 30 seconds to a minute. You can also use a hand mixer.  
2. When you have a smooth texture like peanut butter, add the 1/2 of the milk and all of the vanilla and mix again. Mix until the dough looks nice and fluffy and the colour is much paler. It will take about 30 seconds to 2 minutes.  
3. Start adding in the flour, little bit at a time while you continue to mix on low speed. Continue to mix until you have added all of the flour and the dough has come together. If the dough appears crumbly or dry, add more milk, 1 Tbsp at a time.  
4. Once the dough has come together, stop the mixer and add in the chocolate chips. Continue mixing until they are well combined. The dough should be soft and smooth - add more milk as required to achieve this texture.  
5. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 20 minutes. Scoop the cookie dough and enjoy!  
Notes: Don't leave the pan unsupervised at any point, the flour will burn and turn the cookie dough bitter.",2292

# Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 yellow onion peeled and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 1 teaspoon sugar optional
* 1 pound ground beef
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 2 teaspoons dry thyme
* 3 teaspoons fruit preserves of your choice (recommend apricot, prune, fig, blackberry)
* 1 cup white rice uncooked
* 1 small head savoy cabbage trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced
* 10 cups water or chicken stock
* Salt and pepper to taste

## For serving:

* Fresh dill
* Sour cream

## Instructions

## Caramelize the onions:

* Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, melt the butter and add the onions. Cook, stirring regularly, for 15 minutes until they soften and the edges begin to darken.
* If desired, sprinkle with sugar to help speed up the caramelizing process. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking for 1520 minutes until the onions are deep, golden-brown, and well-caramelized. Remove them from the pot and set them aside.

## Brown the beef:

* If the pot seems dry, add another teaspoon of oil. Turn the heat to medium-high and add the ground beef. Cook, breaking it up with a spoon, for 1520 minutes until well-browned and thoroughly cooked through. Season with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, and thyme. Add the fruit preserves and stir to incorporate. Cook an additional 12 minutes.

## Simmer the soup:

* Add the white rice, reserved caramelized onions, and the thinly sliced cabbage to the pot. Season the cabbage with a few shakes of salt. Pour the water or stock over and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir the soup occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking.

## Finish the soup:

* Remove the lid from the pot, taste the soup, and season to your preferences. Simmer an additional 10 minutes, uncovered. If the soup is too thick, add another splash of water or stock to the pot.

## To serve:

* Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh dill or parsley. If you like, serve with a dollop of sour cream. Enjoy!

"" 9 cloves Garlic

"" 5 handfuls Petit Pois

"" 5 cups Long grain white rice

"" Sunflower oil


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Step 1. Pork marinating. Prepare 8 hours before cooking, or overnight.

"" In a bowl, mix together;

   1 cup of white sugar

   8 teaspoons of salt

   2 teaspoons of Chinese Five Spice

   1 teaspoon of white pepper

   2 teaspoons of Sesame Oil

   4 tablespoons of water

   4 tablespoons of soy sauce

   4 tablespoons of hoisin sauce

   8 teaspoons of Molasses/Black Treacle

   1 tablespoon of red food colouring

   9 finely minced well sized garlic cloves


"" When well mixed, place 8 tablespoons of the sauce in a separate bowl, over with cling film and place in the fridge.

"" Take the pork shoulder joint, and carve into slices about ½ inch thick, or as close as you can. Place in large dish/dishes. Take your sauce and brush/rub on the pork slices, both sides. Use all your sauce evenly, the pork should be swimming in a puddle of it. Cover and place in the fridge for 8 hours/overnight.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Step 2. Cooking the pork. If using a fan/convection oven, reduce temperatures and times by 10%.

"" Preheat your oven to 475°F/246°C, with a rack positioned in the top third of the oven. Line a sheet pan with foil and place a metal rack on top. Pour 1&amp;½ cups of water into the pan (catches drippings, prevents burning) and transfer HALF of your marinated pork onto the rack, with as much gap as possible between cuts of meat.

"" Place in oven for 10 minutes

"" Reduce the oven to 375°F/190°C, cook for a further 15 minutes.

"" Flip all cuts of meat over, rotate tray, return for 15 more minutes. During those 15 minutes, take the second bowl of sauce you separated last night and mix in 8 tablespoons of honey, and 4 tablespoons of hot water. Stir very well.

"" Remove the tray, take a brush and glaze all cuts of meat with the sauce, flip and glaze the other side. And return to the oven for 10 more minutes.

"" Remove the tray and transfer the meat to a resting rack (or just a tray covered with foil) out of the oven. Apply one more coat of glaze and then leave to rest for 10 minutes.

"" Slice into small cubes and place in a tupperware tub in the fridge.

"" Replace the foil in the sheet pan, add another 1&amp;½ cups of water, return the temperature to 475°F/246°C and repeat the above instructions with the other half of the pork.

Step 3. The Rice.

"" Take 5 cups of Long Grain White Rice and place into a large saucepan with 9 cups of water. Place the pan on the stove at medium/high heat, with NO LID, and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down to low, put the lid on, and cook for 13 minutes. Then take off the heat, leaving the lid on, and sit for 10 more minutes. Take the lid off, stir/fluff up the rice and leave the pan to the side.

"" Place 5 small handfuls of petit pois (small peas) in a pan and cook. Then place it to the side. 

"" Chop 6 spring onions(scallions?) Into small circles, put to the side.

"" Make the following sauce for the rice by mixing together;

   4 tablespoon of hot water

   4 teaspoons of honey

   4 teaspoons of Sesame oil

   1 teaspoon of white pepper

   1½ tablespoons of hoisin sauce

   1½ tablespoons of oyster sauce

   5½ tablespoons of soy sauce.

   Mix very well.

"" Heat a wok over medium/high heat. Add sunflower oil and quickly add ¼ of the rice (don't heat the oil up first or the rice will explode when added) and stir/toss well. Sprinkle on salt and stir/toss well. Add ¼ of the pork and ¼ of the peas and stir/toss well. Pour in ¼ of the sauce and stir well, really get the sauce even, and then toss. Cook while tossing for a couple minutes. Add ¼ of the spring onions and mix well then serve up into a large baking dish.

"" Repeat 3 more times until all the rice, pork, peas, sauce, and spring onions are used. You will now have one very large baking dish FULL of the best pork fried rice you've ever known. Dish up a portion for now, cover the rest and put into the fridge.

2022-03-18,46,"Homemade Take 5 Bars","yellowjacquet","Homemade version of my favorite candy bar! Pretzels, peanut butter, caramel, peanuts, and chocolate. This version uses dark chocolate and I like to finish them with a little bit of flakey sea salt.

# Recipe

Makes: \~ 50 pieces

**Ingredients** 

* \~100 square pretzels (I use Snyders)
* 2 cups creamy peanut butter (I use Jif)
* 1 13.4 oz can dulce de leche (milk caramel)\*\*
* \~1 cup salted peanuts 
* \~24 oz dark bakers chocolate (I use Ghirardelli 60% cacao)
* Flakey sea salt, for topping (optional)



\*\*If you cant find a can of dulce de leche (usually in the baking aisle near the sweetened condensed milk) google how to make dulce de leche from sweetened condensed milk! 

**Instructions** 

1. Line a large (13x17) jelly roll pan with wax paper. Arrange the pretzel squares in neat rows, filling as much of the pan as possible. 
2. Measure out the peanut butter into a microwave safe dish and melt it in the microwave until runny. I use the soften/melt setting on my microwave and stop to mix every 30 seconds. Once melted, pour as evenly as possible over the pretzels. Use a silicone spreader to smooth it into an even layer.
3. Place the tray in freezer until the peanut butter is solid (at least 30 mins).   

4. Pour the can of dulce de leche into a microwave safe dish  and warm it in the microwave until runny. I use the soften/melt setting on my microwave and stop to mix every 30 seconds. Remove the tray from the freezer and pour the dulce de leche over the layer of peanut butter. Use a silicone spreader to smooth it into an even layer.
5. Scatter approximately 1 cup of peanuts over the top of the caramel, try to get it as evenly covered as possible. Once scattered, gently press the peanuts down into the caramel using your hands. 
6. Place the tray back into the freezer until everything firms up again (at least 30 minutes). Note, the dulce de leche will not completely harden. 
7. Once cooled, break the bars into pieces approximately two pretzels in size. Resist the urge to make larger pieces, these bars are very rich. Return the pieces back to the freezer once separated. 
8. Working in batches as necessary, gently melt the chocolate in a double boiler and coat each bar in chocolate then place it onto wax paper. Keep the bars as frozen as possible, only pull one or two out at a time as you go. I use a fork to support the bar and a silicon scraper to make sure its fully coated. Allow excess chocolate to run off before placing on the wax paper. 
9. Optional - after the bars are coated, top with a little bit of flakey sea salt. Add the salt when the chocolate is partially set. 
10. Serve bars at room temp. Store bars in an airtight container at room temp for up to 2 weeks. Store extras in the freezer, they should stay good for months just allow them to come to room temp before serving.   


**Notes**

* 1 batch is huge, consider making a half batch or just store extra bars in the freezer for later!
* I strongly recommend using bakers chocolate and not chocolate chips for coating because it usually melts down smoother, but feel free to use whatever works well for you.

* ½ tablespoon grated fresh ginger
* 1 bunch of scallion, chopped (3 tablespoon whites/light green &amp; 3 tablespoon dark greens)

* 1 tablespoon fish sauce
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Cook pasta in salted water, according to package instructions.
2. In a saucepan, over medium heat, heat a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil.
3. Add the chopped shallots and stir. The shallots should hiss a little when they touch the oil, which means the oil temperature is perfect to sauté the shallots, getting them translucent and bringing out the sweetness. The sautéing will take about two or three minutes. 
4. Add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and chopped white parts of the scallions for another minute, stirring everything well.
5. Add the rest of the ingredients - except the dark green parts of the scallions and the sesame seeds - and reduce heat to a simmer.
6. Mix very well and taste. Yes, its in your face. Its strong, bitey, and hot.

**Ingredients**

* 3lb Alligator Meat
* 1 Quart Buttermilk
* 2lb Small Shrimp, peeled, de-veined tail-off
* 2lb Smoked Sausage, cut into coins
* ½lb Andouille Sausage, diced
* 1 Cup Vegetable Oil
* 1-½ Cups All Purpose Flour
* 2 Yellow Onions, diced
* 2 Stalks Celery, diced

* 6 Cloves Garlic, minced
* 8 Cups Chicken Stock
* 2 Tablespoons Garlic Powder
* 2 Tablespoons Onion Powder
* 4 Tablespoons Creole Seasoning
* 1 Tablespoon Oregano, dried
* 2 Large Bay Leaves

**Instructions**

1. Add the alligator to an airtight container and cover with buttermilk, 1 Tablespoon of Onion Powder, 1 Tablespoon Garlic Powder and 2 Tablespoons Creole Seasoning. Soak in the refrigerator overnight.
2. Start making your roux. Add the flour and oil to a large soup pot. Cook on medium heat stirring about every minute or so to make sure you don't burn it. You want your roux to look as dark as Hershey Chocolate.
3. Add the smoked sausage and andouille sausage and cook in the roux for a few minutes, to caramelize the sausage.
4. Add the trinity of onions, green pepper and celery. Cook until translucent.
5. Add the garlic and cook a further 2 minutes.
6. Add the chicken stock, stirring, until combined.
7. Add 1 Tablespoon Garlic Powder, 1 Tablespoon Onion Powder, 2 Tablespoons Creole Seasoning, 1 Tablespoon Oregano and 2 Bay Leaves. Stir and cover the pot. Turn the heat to low to allow a good simmer.
8. Cook for 1 hour like this.
9. Drain the alligator from the buttermilk and add to the gumbo. Cover again and simmer another 1 hour.
10. Add the shrimp cook to a rolling simmer for about 5 minutes.
11. Turn off the heat and serve on rice, with potato salad.

**Notes**

* Have some gumbo file handy to offer when serving.
* It is important to soak the alligator meat as it tends to be quite a tough type of meat. Soaking in the buttermilk overnight will ensure it's soft.
* I used the tenderloin (from the tail) - it's the most tender part of the alligator.
* Traditionally Okra is used to thicken soups (back in the day). Gumbo actually translates to Okra. I however am not a fan and prefer to use a roux.
* American alligators are in abundance in the south and you can pick up alligator meat from a local meat market - or if you're lucky like we are - happen to know some alligator hunters. This is something you have to be licensed for though, it's not something anyone can just go out and do.
* If you find your Gumbo is a little too thick you can add some boiling water or extra stock.",2635

**INGREDIENTS**  
***Choux Pastry***

* ½ c butter
* ½ c granulated sugar
* 1 c water
* 1 c all-purpose flour
* 4 extra-large eggs

***Crema Pasticcera***

* 4 egg yolks
* 2 c whole milk
* ½ c granulated sugar
* 3 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Lemon zest from 1 lemon

***Additional Toppings***

* Confectioners sugar
* Pitted cherries (either sour or maraschino)  


**INSTRUCTIONS**  
***Crema Pasticcera (Pastry Cream)***

1. In a pot over low heat, warm up the milk and vanilla until it starts to steam.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar, then add the cornstarch and whisk again until smooth.
3. Once the milk has warmed up, add about ½ c of the milk to the egg mixture while constantly whisking. This will temper the eggs, so you dont wind up with scrambled eggs.
4. Increase the heat on the stove to low-medium and add the egg mixture and lemon zest to the milk, whisking continuously. After a few minutes, the crema pasticcera will thicken up to a thick custard-like consistency.
5. Remove from heat, place in a bowl, and let cool on the counter for a few minutes.  
Once the bowl is cool enough to handle, cover it with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic touches the cream. This will prevent it from forming a crust. Place in the refrigerator to cool further.

***Choux Pastry Dough***

1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. In a pot over medium heat, bring butter, sugar, and water to a rolling boil.
3. Next, add all of the flour at once and vigorously stir until it forms a ball.
4. Remove pot from the heat and add eggs one at a time then stirring until each egg is thoroughly incorporated. Stir until it reaches a consistency like a thick icing (not like a bread dough at all!).
5. Let cool a few minutes.

***Baking***

1. Prepare a baking sheet lined with either a silicone mat or parchment paper.
2. Place pastry dough in a piping bag with a star tip (or a ziploc bag with a small piece of corner cut off).
3. Pipe dough into circles measuring about 4 inches in diameter, working from the inside out, then make a second layer on top of the first, but leave a hole in the center of the second layer (this is where the pastry cream will be added later). Make sure to leave a few inches between each one, as they will puff up a bit while baking.
4. Bake for 30 minutes or until the dough turns a light golden brown. When lightly pressed with a finger, the zeppole will have slightly spongy feel, like a doughnut.
5. Let cool on the counter.

***Putting It All Together***

1. Once the zeppole have cooled, remove the crema pasticcera from the fridge and place in a piping bag with a star tip (or a ziploc bag with a small piece of corner cut off).
2. Pipe the cream into the center of each zeppole and continue around, making a circle of cream, then back to the middle for a tall center.
3. Lightly dust with powdered sugar and top with a cherry.",3140

[Super easy sausage rolls](https://youtu.be/AnR3ERkeF7k)  


**Ingredients**



* 250g Sausage meat - pre-seasoned
* 1 pre-rolled puff pastry sheet
* Egg wash

**Instructions**

1. Preheat the oven to 200C/425F.
2. Use a piece of cling film to roll out the sausage meat into two equal sausages the same width as your pastry sheet
3. Place the sausage meat onto the pasty sheet and gently press along the edge of the pastry where it will overlap - this will prevent the pastry from being too thick where it is doubled up.
4. Cut the pastry to size and repeat on the opposite edge
5. Use egg wash to bind the pastry together and then, on a floured surface, cut each sausage into four equal sized pieces.
6. Score the tops and brush with egg wash before baking in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until the meat is cooked and the pastry is a golden brown colour.
7. Allow to cool slightly and enjoy.

**Tips**

* Add a teaspoon of water to your egg wash to make it easier to apply

2022-03-13,15,"Classic Arepas","shots-by-leo","who loves classic Colombian arepas? we got these made by Jenie Ashbaugh, former percussionist for Enrique Iglesias. :)   


**to make your own crispy &amp; delicious arepas at home, you'll need:** 

* 1 cup pre-cooked corn meal
* about 1 cup of warm water (you feel it out with your dough)
* queso fresco, crumbled or sliced
* butter, room temperature
* salt to taste
* arepa griddle (if you have one)

  
**and just follow these quick easy steps!** 

1. Begin by combining your corn meal, some salt, and about 3/4 cups of your water. Combine with your hands, feeling if the dough is too sticky or too firm. If too firm, add more water. If too sticky, add more corn meal. When it is still soft to the touch, but not sticky enough to stick to the side of the bowl, that is perfect consistency. 
2. Separate and form your disks, making them as large/small as you'd like. Press them down with an arepa press, or you can put the dough between lines of parchment paper and press down with a cutting board to flatten. 
3. Get your arepa griddle (or your pan) to medium high heat, adding your arepa dough. Crisp for 2-3 minutes on each side until you get a nice golden brown color, adding butter to the surface as you go to add richness to their color and flavor.
4. Cut off the edges of the arepas so you're able to peel them open, adding your queso fresco. You can stop there, or continue to grill at low heat to melt the cheese.   


and just like that, you have your own cheesy, salty arepas. fill them with eggs, meats, or anything you'd want!

"" 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)

"" 1 teaspoon kosher salt

"" 1 ½ teaspoons honey

"" 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more to oil pan

"" Desired pizza sauce (alfredo, tomato, pesto, etc.) 

"" Desired pizza toppings (tomatoes, cheeses, peppers, meats, etc.)

**Directions**

1. Place flour in mixing bowl with dry yeast, salt, honey, olive oil, and warm water. Put everything in first then add the water. Mix for like 5-6 minutes until everything is totally smooth and the correct consistency& it should be not exactly pourable but not exactly able to form a Doug ball. (Add more water/flour as needed. Should be sticky, wet and essentially impossible to handle though)

2. Olive oil a sheet pan and spread this mixture out and try to fill it to the edges. (This should be pretty easy as its not even really a fully solidified dough, it is pretty liquidy)

3. Cover with another sheet pan and place in a warm (below 110° or yeast will die) oven to bubble for 3-5 hours 

4. Once desired level of bubblyness has occurred do not squish down the bubbles. add salt, and a tiny amount of olive oil and bake at 540° 20-25min (check on it, you want very very light browning) 

5. Remove and add sauce, cheese and other toppings. (When placing cheese Make sure that there is cheese on the edges of the dough on top between the edge of the pan and dough. This way when the pizza cooks the cheese will melt and the rendered cheese fat will fry the edges super crispy)

6. Bake at 540° for 10-20min. You want everything to be really crispy on top and the sides and for all of the dough to cook though.

**Dough**

* 86 grams graham cracker crumbs finely ground
* 228 grams all-purpose flour plus more for dusting
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 50 grams butter
* 132 grams granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

**Graham Cracker Crust**

* 30 grams butter
* 40 grams graham cracker crumbs, finely ground
* 13 grams granulated sugar

**Cheesecake**

* 1/2 large egg (preserve other half for egg wash)
* 113 grams cream cheese
* 50 grams granulated sugar
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 20 canned cherries for garnishing

**INSTRUCTIONS**

**Dough**

* Combine the flour and ground graham cracker crumbs with the baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl.
* In a mixing bowl, combine the soft butter with the sugar until they cream. Then, add the eggs and vanilla to combine.
* Using a wooden spoon, spatula, or stand mixer, mix in the dry ingredients to form a dough. Divide the dough in half and pat it out into discs and wrap them in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least two hours or up to one day.

**Filling**

* Make the graham cracker crust by melting the butter and using a fork to mix in the graham crumbs and the sugar. Set aside.
* Beat the sugar, egg, cream cheese, and vanilla until well blended. Set aside in refrigerator so it becomes more solid.

**Bake**

* Preheat the oven to 350F or 175C and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
* Dust some flour on your workspace and roll out one disc of dough at a time until it's between 1/3 and 1/2-centimeter thick. Add more flour as necessary to prevent sticking.
* Cut out 3 or 7.5cm circles (I use the rim of my whiskey glass), re-rolling scraps as needed. Brush the edges with egg wash. Scoop 1 teaspoon of graham cracker crust and pack it into your spoon. This will help it stick together. Then plop it in the center of your hamantaschen and flatten slightly with the back of your teaspoon. Top that with 1/2 teaspoon of cream cheese. At this point, you can optionally add your cherry on top or save it for the end. If adding it now, be sure to press it slightly into the center.

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, including how to make your own buttermilk, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/irish-soda-bread/](https://maplewoodroad.com/irish-soda-bread/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1-¾ c buttermilk
* 1 large egg
* 4-T c all purpose flour
* 4 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1-½ teaspoon salt
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold and cubed
* 1 c raisins or dried currants (optional)  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Preheat oven to 400	.
2. Whisk together the buttermilk and egg.
3. In a separate bowl, stir together the dry ingredients.
4. In the bowl with the flour mixture, cut in the cold, cubed butter using either your fingers, a fork, or a pastry cutter until it starts to resemble a coarse meal.
5. Stir in raisins or dried currants, if using, until they're well coated in the flour mixture.
6. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir together with a wooden spoon until it's so stiff you can't stir anymore.
7. **Tip:** It should be a sticky, shaggy dough. But if it's still a bit too wet, add a little more flour.
8. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, knead just enough to make sure all ingredients are wet, and form into a round shape.
9. **Tip:** Do not over-knead this bread or it will get tough. The only purpose of slight kneading for a minute is to make sure all the ingredients are evenly dispersed throughout the dough and get it into a round shape.
10. Place the dough onto your cast iron pan, dutch oven, baking sheet, or whatever you're going to use to bake it.
11. Cut a deep X into the top of the bread dough, about 1"" to 1-½"" deep. This will allow the heat of the oven reach the center of the bread, as well as help the bread expand as it rises.
12. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
13. Let cool and then enjoy!",1894

* 2 Poached Eggs
* Hollandaise Sauce

**Ingredients for the Hollandaise Sauce**

* 2 Yolks

* 1/2 tsp Cyder/White Wine Vinegar
* Pinch of Salt
* 1 tsp Chopped Tarragon
* 50g Melted Butter
* Pinch of Cayenne
* Squeeze of Lemon

**Instructions**

1. Whisk together the egg yolks, water, salt and tarragon. After a couple of minutes the mixture should be pale and light. Then whisk for a further two minutes over a bowl of simmering water until the eggs become a little thicker and creamier. Now is a good time to poach your eggs.
2. Remove from  the heat and slowly add the melted butter whilst continuing to whisk until the sauce becomes thick and creamy - you will not need all of the butter and add it slowly to stop it from separating.
3. When you're happy with the consistency, add a pinch of cayenne and squeeze of lemon to taste.
4. Lay the ham on the toasted muffins, add the eggs and ladle over the sauce.

2022-03-05,6,"Seared Shrimp With Garlic Butter Pan Sauce","crashcoursekitchen","I made it my mission to figure out how to get that tiger-spotted char on shrimp that I love so much and figured out a pretty good technique to get that, plus I'm adding my recipe for a white wine/garlic butter pan sauce. [Short video if you want to watch me make it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re0n_YTtE3s&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Seared Shrimp Ingredients**

* 1/2 lb Jumbo Shrimp (16-25 count per lb) (225g)
* 2 tbsp Olive Oil (30ml, 30g)
* 1/2 tsp Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt (1.5g)
* 1/4 tsp Sugar (small pinch)

**Garlic Butter Pan Sauce Ingredients**

* 6 tbsp Butter (85g)
* 5  Garlic Cloves, coarsely minced (25g)
* 3 finger pinch red pepper flakes
* 1/2 cup Dry White Wine (120ml, 115g)
* Lemon Zest To Taste (1/4 to 1/2 lemon)
* Chopped Parsley To Taste (big handful)
* Salt &amp; Pepper To Taste (1/8-1/4 tsp of each)

**Directions/Recipe**

1. Toss 1/2 lb of jumbo shrimp with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, followed by 1/2 tsp of diamond crystal kosher salt and 1/4 tsp of sugar.
2. Preheat a large saute pan over medium-low heat, then spread your shrimp out in an even layer with plenty of room between each piece, no need to add any extra oil to the pan. (If you are getting smoke, your pan is too hot).
3. Sear shrimp for two minutes, or until the first side is nicely browned.  

4. Turn off the heat, flip the shrimp over to the uncooked side, and then let them sit in the pan for 90 seconds before transferring them to a plate where the residual heat will finish cooking them through.
5. Using low heat, melt six tablespoons of butter in the pan your shrimp was in. Then Add five cloves of coarsely minced garlic, and an optional sprinkle of red pepper flakes.
6. Turn the heat up to medium-low, cook just until the garlic becomes fragrant, then add a half cup of white wine and cook for two to three minutes until the sauce reduces, thickens a bit, and doesn't taste boozy anymore.
7. Add your shrimp back into the pan, coat it with the sauce, and finish it with some chopped parsley, a few cranks of ground black pepper, zest from half of  a lemon, some additional salt to taste, and you're good to go.

**Final Thoughts**  
The shrimp and a big hunk of crusty bread to soak up all that heavenly sauce are all you really need to make a satisfying meal, but toss the shrimp along with the pan sauce over a quick cooking pasta like angel hair  and serve with a little side of salad greens and thinly sliced fennel topped with a drizzle of olive oil, a spritz of lemon juice, and pinch of salt for a restaurant quality meal that's ready in about 30 minutes.

2022-03-03,22,"Creamy Chicken Pasta Recipe","BushyEyes","**Recipe here originally: [Creamy Chicken Pasta Recipe](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/creamy-chicken-pasta-recipe/)**

This creamy chicken pasta recipe is a rich, comforting creamy chicken pasta with vegetables like Brussels sprouts and roasted red bell peppers.

This creamy chicken pasta recipe can be made in a few different ways:

* Raw split chicken breasts that you turn into a homemade chicken stock
* Leftover shredded chicken from a homemade or store-bought roasted chicken
* Raw, boneless chicken that you simply chop up and sauté until cooked through before starting the sauce

For the recipe below, I used raw split chicken breasts that I turned into very simple chicken stock. However, this does add more time to the recipe. If youre in a pinch and you have leftover shredded chicken already, you can skip the steps for making the stock and move right into the sauce preparation.

**What you need:**

For this recipe, youll primarily need chicken, pasta, vegetables, and heavy cream. Take a look at some of my substitution suggestions so you can modify this dish any way you like:

* **Chicken:** Omit for vegetarian. You could also use shrimp but you would skip baking the dish to avoid overcooking them.
* **Brussels sprouts:** Use your favorite vegetables in this meal! Try it with zucchini, broccoli or broccolini, cauliflower florets, eggplant, or use spinach.
* **Roasted red bell peppers:** Chopped sun-dried tomatoes

### Equipment

* Large pot
* Baking sheet
* Wide ovenproof pot
* Sieve
* Tongs

### Ingredients

#### Chicken stock (optional):

* 1 pound bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts
* 1 yellow onion quartered, paper left on
* 1 head of garlic halved, paper left on
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Creamy chicken pasta:

* 16 ounces pasta of your choice like strozzapreti, rigatoni, penne, rotini, or fusilli
* 2 tablespoons neutral oil
* 2 red bell peppers trimmed, seeded, and quartered
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 1 pound Brussels sprouts halved
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more if desired
* S cup all-purpose flour
* 1½ cups homemade chicken stock from above or use store-bought stock
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Freshly minced parsley optional, for garnish

### Instructions

#### Prepare the stock:

* Cover split chicken breasts with water and season liberally with salt. Add the quartered onion and halved head of garlic. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 3040 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Skim off the foam that floats to the top as the chicken cooks.
* Use tongs to transfer the chicken to a plate and let it cool. Bring the stock back to a boil and boil for 15 minutes until significantly reduced. Strain through a sieve into a large bowl and set aside. You will need 1½ cups stock for the recipe, and any extra stock can be saved for another use.
* Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred it with your fingers, two forks, or dice it up. Discard the skin and bones.
* Wipe out the pot used for the stock and fill it back up with salted water and return it to the stovetop. You'll use it for the pasta later on.

#### Broil the red bell peppers:

* While the stock cooks, prepare the red bell peppers. Arrange the prepared peppers on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Place under a broiler and cook for 78 minutes until blackened all over. Keep an eye on them, so they don't burn to a crisp!
* Immediately transfer the peppers to a Tupperware dish with a lid or a gallon freezer bag. The trapped steam will help the skins come off easily. Peel the peppers and roughly chop and set aside.
* Turn the broiler off and turn the oven's heat to 400ºF.

#### Cook the pasta:

* Bring the pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until 2 minutes under al dente. Drain and set aside.

#### Cook the vegetables:

* In a wide, oven-proof pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Cook the onion until softenedabout 710 minutesand then turn the heat to high. Add the Brussels sprouts and cook for 6 minutes until well-charred. Add the chopped red peppers and cook for 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl.

#### Prepare the sauce:

* Melt the butter in the pot over medium heat. Once bubbly, add dry thyme and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add flour to the butter and cook for 23 minutes until lightly golden. Slowly whisk in the reserved chicken stock. Bring to a low boil and then reduce heat and continue whisking until completely smooth.
* Stir in the heavy cream and whisk until smooth. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and more crushed red pepper if you like. Turn off the heat.

#### Bake the pasta:

* To the sauce, add the cooked chicken, cooked pasta, and the reserved vegetables and toss to coat and evenly distribute the ingredients. Sprinkle the parmesan cheese on top and transfer to the oven for 1015 minutes or until the Brussels sprouts are fork-tender and the cheese is melted. If you like, broil for 23 minutes to char the top of the pasta.

#### To serve:

* Garnish the pasta with fresh minced parsley and serve immediately. Enjoy!

# Carrie's Arizona King Cake

**Dough Ingredients**

* 3.5 cups of AP Flour (NOT cake flour)
* 1 package Quick Rise Yeast
* 1/4 cup of granulated white sugar
* 1 cup of whole milk
* 1.25 tsp salt
* .25 tsp cayenne pepper
* 2 large eggs, local ones with orange yolks
* 1 tsp each lemon and orange peels zested with microplane
* 6 TB butter (more expensive butter is worth it here) cut into 12 pieces while cold, then softened to room temperature.

**For Filling:**

* 1 TB fresh ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp. ground anise seed (alternately, try cardamom here instead)
* 1 1/3 cups packed light brown sugar
* 8 TB butter softened to room temperature
* Icing Ingredients1 cup powdered sugar
* 1 TB milk, more if needed to thin
* 1/2 tsp real vanilla
* 2 tsp fresh citrus zest (I used some lemon, some tangerine.)

**To Decorate:**

* Sparkly sugar in purple, green and gold
* A plastic baby, ceramic bird, or other féve/trinket to hide in the cake too big to be swallow-able
* Throw beads or other Mardi Gras trinkets to decorate the platter
* Gold cardboard circle or purple/green platter

**Cake Instructions:**

1. Begin warming milk, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat until sugar is dissolved and milk is between 120º to 130º. Do not boil!
2. Mix 2 1/2 cups flour and yeast in mixing bowl, using them e paddle attachment, on low for about 30 seconds.
3. With mixer on low, pour in liquids and mix until incorporated. 
4. Add eggs one at a time. Continue mixing until a shaggy dough forms.
5. Clean off paddle and switch to dough hook. 
6. Mix in the remaining 1 cup flour, a little at a time, until a soft dough forms. Stop adding flour.
7. Continuing with the dough hook on medium speed, add the softened butter pieces one at a time until all are absorbed.Leaving the dough hook at a medium speed, knead until a smooth and elastic dough is produced  maybe 6-8 minutes. 
8. If it seems too sticky, you may add a sparing amount of flour, a spoonful at a time, to correct.
9. Form dough into a ball and place in a buttered bowl twice its size. Flip the dough over, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate an hour.

**Prepare Filling:**

1. With paddle attachment in mixer or stirring together by hand, thoroughly combine cinnamon, anise OR cardamom and softened butter.
2. Fill and Shape DoughRoll dough out into a 10 x 20 inch rectangle, and spread filling along one side lengthwise, leaving a border, and then fold the not-covered side of the dough over the filling. 
3. Press the two sides of the dough together firmly to seal.
4. Leaving an inch or two uncut at one end, make two even cuts lengthwise through the dough, forming three strands connected at the top. This is what we braid.
5. Were looking for a longer braid to shape into a ring, so dont braid the strands too tightly. Depending on your skill/ambition, you may want to try turning the strands as you braid them, so some of the filling is more exposed.
6. Seal the ends of the braid together with firm pressure. (Those who hide the féve in the cake before baking sometimes do so here.)
7. Prepare your pan, covering with parchment or giving it a healthy greasing. Think about gooey burnt sugar and cinnamon on your pan and decide to go with parchment paper or a Silpat liner after all.
8. In preparation to form the ring, gently stretch your braid, being careful of exposed filling on edges. Form a circle with the braid, tuck the tail of the braid under and press into the top of the braid to join. 
9. The shape of your rectangle influences the finished crown. A more elongated rectangle makes longer thinner strips, a longer braid and a crown that has a larger diameter. Mine is the converse, producing a fat crown with a smaller interior space.
10. Preheat oven to 350 F/ 177 C 
11. Cover dough with plastic wrap and let rise an hour in a warm place. If it rises in a cool spot, it will take longer to proof. To test, press with a finger. If there is no indentation its not proofed enough. If it springs back, but slowly, youre in the sweet spot: bake it! If your indentation does not spring back, well, youve over-proofed it. Better get it in the oven and better luck next time for a perfect proof!
12. Bake until golden brown, 2035 minutes. This is a WIDE time variation, and thats because the correct time depends on what you did with the braiding and shaping. A wider, thinner circle will cook faster, and a fat, more-closed circle will take longer. It should be firm to the touch and an internal temperature of 190 F indicates the dough has become cake.
13. If youre on parchment, it will be easy to move to a cooling rack immediately. If you didnt use parchment or Silpat, wait a few minutes for the molten sugar to set up and then move to the rack to cool completely.

**Make the icing:** 

1. Add all four ingredients in a mixing bowl with a pouring lip. Alternately, you may want to use a piping bag if you want to get fussy/fancy.
2. If you didnt bake your doll/féve into the King Cake, this is an optimum time to hide it; before the icing goes on. Some people cut a slit on the underside of the cake and shove it in, or wedge it into one of the slashes.
3. When cake is fully cool, drizzle with the icing and then have some fun with the sparkly sugar. Some cakes are kind of striped with the three colors in their own lane. Others are a bit more mosaic, like mine.",5674

* Large pot
* Sieve
* Whisk

### Ingredients

* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* T cup lard or vegetable oil
* 1 yellow onion
* 5 ribs of celery with leaves
* 2 green bell peppers
* 1 red bell pepper
* 6 scallions

* 1 pound andouille sausage sliced into rounds
* 8 cups water plus more if needed

#### For serving:

* Cooked white rice
* Gumbo filé

### Instructions

#### Prepare the holy trinity:

* Before beginning the recipe, prepare all of the ingredients. Reserve any scraps, including onion and garlic paper, the tops and bottoms of the bell peppers, and any root ends from the scallions and celery for the homemade stock. First, peel and dice the onion. Next, trim and slice the celery. Next, trim, deseed, and dice the bell peppers. Transfer the diced onion, peppers, and celery to a large bowl. Trim and mince the scallions and separate the white and green parts. Next, peel and mince the garlic cloves. Keep the white parts of the scallions and the minced garlic together in a bowl. Reserve the green parts of the scallion for serving.

#### Cook the roux:

* Add the flour and oil to a large, heavy-bottomed stockpot and turn the heat to medium. Cook, whisking or stirring regularly, for 2030 minutes until the roux reaches the color of peanut butter. Next, turn the heat to low and continue stirring for an additional 2030 minutes until the roux reaches the color of a copper penny.

#### Prepare the shrimp stock:

* Melt the butter into a second large pot. Add the reserved shrimp shells and cook in the hot butter for 1 minute. Add the reserved prep scraps and cover with 8 cups of water and a generous sprinkle of salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer as the roux cooks.

#### Cook the gumbo:

* Once the roux finishes cooking, add the onion, celery, and bell peppers and turn the heat to medium-high. Stir to coat the vegetables with the roux and cook for 5 minutes.
* Add the garlic and white parts of the scallions and cook for 1 minute more. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Add the Creole seasoning and cayenne powder if using.

#### Add the stock:

* Strain the stock through a sieve into a large bowl. Using a ladle, add a few ladles of the stock to the roux and whisk to incorporate. Continue ladling the stock, whisking after each addition, until all the stock has been addedtaste and season to your preferences. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for an hour until the vegetables are tender. Taste and season once more. Skim off any foam that floats to the top of the gumbo.

#### Finish the gumbo:

* Add the shrimp and andouille sausage to the pot and cook for 510 minutes until the shrimp are opaque and cooked through. Taste and season once more.

#### To serve:

* Serve the gumbo with cooked white rice and garnish with the green parts of the scallions. Sprinkle with gumbo filé and enjoy!

Enjoy this light and fluffy vegan lemon cake with dairy-free lemon frosting for a sweet and tangy treat.

Prep Time: 1 hr

Cook Time: 40 mins

Resting/Cooling Time: 2 hrs

Total Time: 3 hrs 40 mins

Servings: 12

**Ingredients**

**Dry ingredients for the cake:**

* 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
* 1 ¾ cups cake flour
* 1 ½ cups granulated sugar
* 1 tbsp baking soda
* ½ tsp salt

**Wet ingredients for the cake:**

* ½ cup soy milk, or other plant-based milk
* T cup lemon juice, or juice of 4 lemons
* ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
* ½ cup plus 2 tbsp oil
* 2 tbsp vanilla
* 3 tbsp packed grated lemon zest, from about 3 lemons

**Vegan Lemon Buttercream Frosting:**

&amp;#x200B;

* 2 cups vegan butter or margarine, (stick not spreadable in a tub)
* 8 cups confectioners sugar, sifted
* 1 tbsp vanilla
* ¼ cup fresh lemon juice, from about 2 lemons
* 1 tbsp bottled lemon juice, or 1 - 2 tsp lemon extract
* 2 tbsp packed grated lemon zest, from about 2 lemons
* 8 to 14 drops Lemon Yellow food colouring

**To Decorate:**

* Dried Lemon Slices

**Instructions**

**Cake:**

1. Line three 6-inch cake pans with parchment. I recommend using cake strips for a more moist, even bake. Soak in water until ready for use. Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C.
2. Add the sugar to a large bowl of a stand mixer, then sift in the remaining dry ingredients.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the liquid ingredients including the zest until fully combined.
4. Add the bowl of dry ingredients to the stand mixer and while mixing on low, gradually pour in the wet ingredients.
5. Mix for about 30 seconds or until most of the flour is just moistened and the batter is smooth with a few tiny lumps.
6. Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a large spoon or silicone spatula to mix in any dry flour. Dont overmix.
7. Evenly distribute the batter between the cake pans. If using cake strips, squeeze out excess water, wrap around each pan and secure.
8. Place the pans in the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes with cake strips or about 20 to 25 minutes without. A skewer or toothpick inserted should come out clean.
9. Fully cool the cakes in the pans before removing them.

**Lemon Buttercream Frosting:**

1. Add the vegan butter and confectioners sugar to the stand mixer bowl.
2. Add the bowl to the stand mixer and mix on low while gradually adding the lemon juice and vanilla.
3. When smooth and creamy, remove about ¼ cup of the frosting and set aside. Add the lemon zest and lemon extract to the remainder.
4. Add enough food colouring to get your desired shade of yellow. The colour may darken as the frosting dries.

**To Assemble:**

1. Filling a piping bag, or zip-top bag with the corner snipped, with yellow frosting.
2. Dab a bit of frosting on a cake board, stand or plate. Place the first cake layer on the board.
3. Pipe a swirl of frosting on top, without gaps. Spread evenly then add the second cake layer.
4. Add another swirl of frosting, then the final layer, bottom side up.
5. Spread the top and sides with a thin layer of frosting to crumb coat. Place in the fridge for one hour or until the frosting is chilled.
6. Spread the sides and top with the remaining yellow frosting and smooth.
7. Dab some of the reserved white frosting at random spots on the cake. Smooth to add white streaks.
8. Place the dried lemon slices on the cake and add dots of the remaining white frosting with a #2 piping tip.

**Notes:**

* Warm lemons for about 20 seconds in the microwave, before cutting, for easier juicing.
* Scrape the mixer beater as long strands of zest may stick to it.
* Bottled lemon juice usually has citric acid added which can help add extra tartness and lemony flavour.

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/carne-asada-quesadillas/](https://maplewoodroad.com/carne-asada-quesadillas/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 lb skirt steak
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed and roughly chopped
* 2 teaspoon cumin
* 2 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 2 teaspoon chili powder
* 1-½ tablespoon fresh lime juice
* 1-½ tablespoon olive oil
* Half a bunch of cilantro, chopped
* 1-½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  
1-½ teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 tablespoon chopped jalapeños (optional)
* 4 oz grated sharp cheddar cheese
* 4 oz grated pepper jack cheese
* 4 (8-inch) flour tortillas  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. First, we create the marinade. In a bowl, mix some crushed and roughly chopped garlic cloves (no need to mince), freshly squeezed lemon juice, olive oil, cilantro, and some chopped jalapeños (if used). 
2. Trim the meat if necessary and pat it dry with a paper towel.
3. Season with kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, cumin, smoked paprika, and chili powder. 
4. Use your hand to press these dry ingredients onto the meat. 
5. Place the meat in a Ziploc bag and add the marinade.
6. Gently massage the bag to make sure the marinade evenly coats all of the meat.
7. Try to press out as much air as possible before closing the bag. 
8. Put the bag on a plate and place it in the fridge for at least an hour (but not more than 10 hours). 
9. Massage and turn occasionally to get the marinate working, especially if you plan to marinate for only an hour or so.
10. Once youre ready to cook the meat, add just a little bit of a neutral oil, like canola, to a cast iron pan and bring it to medium-high heat. That means to a heat where the oil is really hot but is not smoking yet.
11. Grab the meat with tongs from the Ziploc bag and shake off some of the excessive marinade and the larger garlic chunks.
12. Add the meat to the pan. It should instantly sizzle and smoke a little when touching the hot oil.
13. Cook for about 3 minutes per side (depending on the thickness of the cut).
14. Check with an instant meat thermometer. It should read 130-140	 in the thickest part.
15. Remove from the pan, place on a cutting board, and lightly cover with foil.
16. While resting the steak for a couple of minutes, grate the cheeses. 
17. Next, slice the beef - against the grain - in small, bite-sized strips.
18. Carefully wipe out the cast iron pan with a paper towel without burning yourself. Its okay if the pan is not completely clean. Any little scraps will only add flavor to the tortilla. 
19. Put the pan back on the stove and turn it up to medium heat.
20. Add a soft taco/tortilla to the dry pan (one that fits the diameter of the pan).
21. Sprinkle the whole width of the tortilla with a quarter of the cheese, then add a layer of beef strips to half of the tortilla.
22. When the cheese starts to melt (which takes maybe 1 or 2 minutes), gently - with a spatula - fold the taco/tortilla in half and also gently press it flat so that it looks like a quesadilla should look. 
23. Flip the whole enchilada = and cook on the other side for another 2 minutes or until the cheese is completely melted. 
24. Slide onto a cutting board and cut in half. A pizza cutter works like a charm. A knife works perfectly fine as well.
25. Place on a plate or cutting board and sprinkle some chopped cilantro over the top. Thats just for good looks.
26. Serve with your favorite accompaniments, such as guacamole, salsa, hot sauce, sour cream, black beans, rice, etc. Enjoy!",3535
2022-02-23,8,"Swiss Cheese Fondue","nivekydoom","**Original savable recipe here:** [**https://mem.ai/p/oGbajRMML8rxHbxCggEm**](https://mem.ai/p/oGbajRMML8rxHbxCggEm)

I've spent the last decade trying small variations on every cheese fondue recipe out theremultiple blends of cheeses, ways to achieve the perfect consistency, and which alcohol to introduce. Ultimately, I landed on this recipe about two years ago. It tastes just like fondue you'd eat on a cold night, at a warm restaurant tucked into a Swiss back alley. I've been making it ever since.

**Ingredients (per person)**

* 1 block gruyere
* 1 tablespoon flour (this is the secret to a smooth fondue)
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 0.5 cup white wine (dry, ideally Pinot Grigio)
* 1 tablespoon brandy
* 1/4 small lemon
* 1/2 baguette (ideally one day old for a drier, firmer texture)
* Black pepper
* Ground nutmeg
* Salt

**Directions**

1. Shred the cheese and toss with flour so that the cheese won't clump while melting
2. Cube bread into 1"" cubes, with crust on every cube
3. Heat the fondue pot\* to medium
4. Add wine &amp; minced garlic to the fondue pot and cook for 2 minutes (You do want the wine to boil.)
5. Reduce the fondue pot heat to medium-low (You do not want the cheese to boil. Try to continuously adjust the heat to be as warm as possible without simmering the fondue.)
6. Slowly add cheese until thick and creamy (Be patient and trusting at first. The consistency will develop as you add cheese. You want to stop adding cheese at slightly thicker than the consistency you want the fondue to remain at. It will thin and smoothen slightly with the addition of lemon juice and brandy later on.)
7. Squeeze in the lemon juice
8. Add ground black pepper to taste (You can add quite a bit.)
9. Add nutmeg to taste (Just a touchdon't overdo this.)
10. Add brandy
11. Mix for 30 seconds
12. Add salt to taste (Usually, no extra salt is needed at all, but make sure to taste for lack of salt in case you added too much acid \[wine, lemon, brandy\] or the Gruyere you used was too mild.)
13. Eat!

This caramelized onion ""carbonara"" recipe is a vegetarian take on the Roman classic. While there is no guanciale in this dish, smoked shoyu adds a great meaty flavor.

If you don't have smoked shoyu, you can add a touch of liquid smoke to taste or simply replace it with a touch of soy sauce.

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 55 minutes

Servings: 4 

Calories: 629kcal

### Equipment

* Wide sauté pan
* Large pot
* Whisk
* Colander, if needed

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 2 yellow onions peeled and diced
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 16 ounces spaghetti, rigatoni, or bucatini
* 12 tablespoons smoked shoyu more to taste if desired
* 4 egg yolks
* 2 eggs
* S cup freshly grated parmesan plus more for serving
* Freshly grated black pepper
* Salt

### Instructions

#### Caramelize the onions:

* In a wide sauté pan, heat the butter and extra virgin olive oil over medium heat until the butter is frothy and bubbly. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring regularly, until the onions deepen in color. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent it from burning. About 15 minutes in, add the sugar and smoked shoyu and continue cooking the onions for an additional 1520 minutes until fully caramelized and deep, golden brown. Season with salt. Turn off the heat.

#### Cook the pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until 12 minutes under al dente. Scoop out 1½ cups of pasta cooking water and drain the pasta. Note: depending on how you time it, you may be ready to cook the eggs right as the pasta finishes cooking, in which case, you can just use tongs to transfer the pasta straight from the water to the pot of caramelized onions. If you aren't ready, just drain the pasta first!

#### Prepare the egg mixture:

* In a large bowl, combine the egg yolks, eggs, parmesan, and ground black pepper to taste. Whisk for 35 minutes until smooth and creamy. Set aside.

#### Temper the egg mixture and finish the carbonara:

* Whisking constantly, pour half of the pasta cooking water into the bowl of eggs to temper the egg mixture.
* Return the heat on the skillet of caramelized onions to medium-low. Add the cooked pasta and toss to coat with the onions.
* Keeping the heat on low, slowly add the egg mixture, tossing regularly, until completely coated. Turn off the heat as soon as the sauce is coated, and the pasta is warmed through (about 12 minutes). If the sauce is quite thick, add more of the remaining pasta cooking water until the sauce reaches your desired consistency. It should be glossy and stick to the pasta! Taste and season with salt and more freshly ground pepper to taste.

#### To serve:

* Immediately serve the carbonara in shallow pasta bowls and garnish with more parmesan and black pepper. Enjoy!

## Equipment

* Large stockpot
* Sieve

## Ingredients

## Chicken stock:

* 3- pound whole chicken giblets removed and discarded
* 2 chicken leg quarters optional
* 5 ribs celery with leaves roughly chopped
* 3 carrots scrubbed and cut into thirds
* 1 onion with paper quartered
* 2 dry bay leaves
* 1 bunch parsley torn or cut in half
* Salt and pepper
* Water

## Chicken barley soup:

* 1 tablespoon oil for sautéing
* 7 ounces mushrooms of choice like beech, cremini, or shiitake, sliced or torn depending on variety
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 4 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and diced
* 5 carrots trimmed, peeled, and diced
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 cup pearl barley
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Fresh minced parsley optional, for serving

## Instructions

## Prepare the chicken stock:

* Place the chicken in a big stockpot with celery, carrots, onion, bay leaves, and parsley. Cover with water and season liberally with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 34 hours. Skim off any scum or foam that rises to the top. Let the pot cool and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.

## Finish the chicken stock:

* The next day, remove the chicken from the broth and transfer it to a bowl. Strain the stock through a sieve into a big bowl and discard the solids. Pick the chicken from the bones and discard the skin and carcass. Wipe out the stockpot and return it to the stovetop.

## Prepare the chicken barley soup:

* Once your stock is ready to go, prepare the soup. Heat the neutral oil in the stockpot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook for 810 minutes. Add the onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring often, for an additional 810 minutes.
* Add the dry thyme, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the reserved stock and chicken meat. Add the barley and then bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 3045 minutes. If needed, supplement the soup with a bit of water or storebought stock, but you likely wont need it!

## Finish the soup:

* Once the barley is tender, turn off the heat, taste the soup, and season to your preferences.

## To serve:

* Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with more freshly minced parsley, if you like. Enjoy!

For my homemade waffle recipe, tips, and tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/strawberry-shortcake-waffles/](https://maplewoodroad.com/strawberry-shortcake-waffles/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 2 waffles
* 6 large strawberries (plus extra for garnish), hulled, chopped, and mashed with a fork
* 2 tablespoons sugar, divided
* S c heavy cream
* 2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened to room temperature
* ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 tablespoon Nutella
* Sprinkle of confectioners sugar (optional)

  
**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. We're first going to make the strawberry compote. Hull and slice about 6 large strawberries, and mash them with a fork.
2. Place the mashed strawberries and 1 tablespoon of sugar into a small saucepan and warm up over low-medium heat. 
3. Simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Next, start making the waffles of your choice, whether that means toasting or cooking.
5. While the strawberries are simmering and the waffles are cooking, let's make the whipped cream. This can be done by hand with a whisk, but a stand mixer or handheld electric mixer makes it much easier.
6. Mix together the heavy cream, softened cream cheese, 1 tablespoon sugar, and vanilla until firm peaks. Note: This whipped cream won't really reach stiff peaks as much as a regular whipped cream does, due to the addition of cream cheese.
7. Place Nutella in a small bowl and microwave for 30 seconds. Then, stir with a spoon to make it soft and spreadable.
8. Once the waffles are ready, top them first with Nutella, then layer on the strawberry compote and whipped cream. Enjoy!",1788

**Ingredients list:**

**For the dough:**

* 450g water
* 7g yeast
* 650g flour (11% protein)
* 18g salt

**For the sauce:**

* 1 can whole peeled tomatoes
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1 pinch oregano
* 1 tsp. sugar (if needed) 

**A must for or the toppings:**

* Buffalo mozzarella
* Low moisture mozzarella
* Pecorino (or Parmesan). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. I will use a food processor. As I explained before, preparing the dough by hand is quite achievable, but it takes 10 minutes to knead. Through the robot we get instant hydration and good gluten network development, with zero effort. We will need 450 g of water at room temperature, 18 g of salt, 7 g of instant yeast, as well as 650 g of pizza flour with at least 11% protein.
2. Close the robot and pulse several times so that the water mixes with some of the flour and a thick paste is created. This makes for an easier cleaning of the bowl afterwards.
3. Start the machine. A ball of dough should form almost instantly on the sides of the bowl. If this does not happen, add a little more flour. Let the machine run for about 45 seconds to develop the gluten network.
4. Prepare your work surface. Without adding extra flour, take out the dough. Knead it several times and shape it into a ball by folding the edges of the dough towards the center and pushing it out with your thumbs.
5. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts or 280 g each. With the same movements as before, shape each of the pieces into a ball. Finally cup the dough with your hands and pull. With this movement we will have perfect dough balls. The last step is to pinch the seam on the bottom of the dough. Do not miss this step, it will ensure easy ""opening"" of the dough without tears.
6. In 4 containers put 1 teaspoon of olive oil each, roll the dough balls in it and close the containers with foil or a lid.
7. Transfer them to the refrigerator for 1 to 3 days and let the yeast do its job. On the day of baking prepare the tomato  sauce. Pour the contents of 1 can into a bowl and mash the tomatoes by hand. Check the taste of the tomatoes. If you feel they are too acidic, add 1 tsp sugar. Also add a pinch of oregano and 1 tsp salt. Stir to combine and leave it in the fridge for a few hours. This will enhance the flavors further.
8. To ""open"" the pizza dough, sprinkle a little flour on the work surface, as well as on the dough in the container. Take out the dough and sprinkle extra flour on top. With your fingertips draw a circle in the dough, one centimeter (or a third of an inch) from its edges.This is how we form the pizza board. We continue by pressing the middle part of the pizza with our fingers again. After a few presses, the dough should have flattened to a size of about 15 cm or 6 inches. Run the fingers of one hand under the dough and turn it over on the other hand. Place it on the counter and press the middle part of the pizza again with fingers to flatten it further.
9. To get the final size of the dough, place the palm of our dominant hand on the dough, just before the board, and pull with the other. After the pull, my left hand turns the dough over on the right, which rotates it 90 degrees and puts it in the starting position. Repeat the movements several times until you reach a pizza base with a diameter of about 25 cm or 10 inches.
10. The flour I use allows me to pull the finished pizza crust on the pizza peel. If you are unsure or if your dough is softer, you can transfer the crust directly to the peel sprinkled with some flour. Or you can just put the dough on baking paper.
11. Next: a few spoonfuls of tomato sauce that i smear with the back of the spoon. Do not overdo the sauce, because the pizza will becom3e too moist.
12. Now comes the time for the selected toppings. I made three types: Margarita, Pepperoni and Quattro Formaggi.
13. For the Margarita, I added only the buffalo mozzarella and Pecorino.
14. For the Pepperoni pizza: the 2 types of mozzarella, salami Pepperoni and Pecorino.
15. For the Quattro Formaggi: the 2 types of mozzarella, cheddar and Pecorino.
16. Before each of the pizzas enters the oven, pour a thin stream of olive oil on top.
17. Bake the pizza on 2 levels. On the lower level I put my baking steel or stone, which I preheat for at least 30 minutes at max temperature. Put the pizza in the oven and immediately turn on the grill to maximum. I'm waiting for the pizza board to puff up and the cheeses to melt.
18. Next put the inverted oven tray as close as possible to the top of the oven. Take out the pizza from the lower level and put it under the grill for about a minute or until golden brown. If you want, now is the time to add a few basil leaves, which you have previously brushed with olive oil.
19. As for the alternative method, take your largest pan. Heat it and put the dough in it, followed by the toppings. Do not heat the pan too much, because the dough will burn. As soon as the board puffs up and the cheeses melt, transfer under the grill.
20. Remove the pizza on a wire rack for a minute, until the cheeses firm up.",5159

2022-02-21,1,"Curry Paste [Homemade]","baidawi","This curry sauce uses very simple ingredients that you can find anywhere. The only novelty ingredient used here is tamarind or tambran. If you cant get your hands on fresh tambran you can substitute it with tamarind chutney or a green mango. The fresh tambran adds a sour note to the curry sauce.

Once you have your curry paste done you can use it to create a variety of dishes. In the [full recipe](https://eatahfoodtt.com/mmhmm/curry-sauce/) I demonstrated how it can be used in three ways.

**Ingredients**

* 3 tbsp curry powder
* 1 tbsp red chili flakes
* 8 carapulay/curry leaves
* 1/2 cup fresh tamarind (shell removed)
* 4 large onions (chopped)
* 10 cloves garlic (minced)
* 23 piece ginger (minced)
* 8 tomatoes (diced)
* 2 bundle chives (chopped)
* 1 bundle fine thyme leaves
* 2 cups coconut milk
* salt &amp; black pepper (to taste)
* 4 tbsp vegetable oil

**Method**

1. Put fresh tamarind into a saucepan with 1 1/2 cups of water.
2. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and allow to simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until thickened
3. Add oil to a pot then sauté onions for 6 to 8 minutes or until light brown in color.
4. Add garlic, ginger, carapuly, curry powder and chili flakes then sauté for 3 to 5 minutes.
5. Add tomatoes, chives and thyme.
6. Season with salt and black pepper then sauté for 3 to 5 minutes
7. Add 3 tbsp of tamarind paste and coconut milk.
8. Simmer on medium/low heat for 15 minutes.
9. Taste for salt then adjust to your preference.

2022-02-20,43,"Caramelized Onion Tart (with balsamic vinegar, honey and thyme)","fuzzician","**CARAMELIZED ONION TART RECIPE**   
*makes enough for 2 hungry people*

**Ingredients**

* 2 large onions
* up to 5 garlic cloves (optional  amount depends on your mood/tastes/what you have)
* 3 Tbsp salted butter
* fresh thyme, as much as you like
* 1 large or 2 small bay leaves (optional  amount depends on your mood/tastes/what you have)
* 6 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 1-2 Tbsp honey
* 2 small sheets of store-bought puff pastry, or enough to cover your pan
* salt
* pepper

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F and small oven-proof frying pan to medium-high heat. Remove puff pastry from freezer to thaw.
2. Peel and cut the onions horizontally across their middle. If using, peel the cloves of garlic.
3. Add enough butter to the pan to coat its bottom generously, and put in a small handful of thyme and (if using) the bay leaves.
4. Once the herbs start getting fragrant, pour in the balsamic vinegar and honey and give everything a swirl to combine. The more honey you use, the stickier/more caramelized the tart will be.
5. Add the onions to the pan, cut side up. Pop in the garlic if using. You should have enough liquid in the pan to spoon a bit over the onions. If not, add a small splash of water and give the pan a gentle swirl to combine the juices. Spoon them over the onions, then season everything generously with salt and pepper and some more thyme leaves.
6. Flip the onions so they are now cut-side down. Cover the pan with a lid and reduce heat to medium-low. Youll want to leave the onions in long enough so that they can soften a bit and absorb the flavours in which they are bathing. This should take about 15 minutes, give or take. Then remove the lid to let the liquid caramelize, turning the heat up if necessary to help the process.
7. While the liquid caramelizes, roll out your puff pastry to ensure it will neatly cover your pan.
8. Once onions are tender and ready, place the pastry over the pan, using a wooden spoon to tuck the edges in snugly around the edges.
9. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until the pastry is nicely golden and puffed up. Remove from the oven (be careful! the pan handle is hot!). To do so, cover the pan with an upturned plate, hold the handle with a thick dishcloth or oven mitt, then confidently flip the pie out of the pan and onto the plate. If using bay leaves, remove before serving.
10. Bring to the table and enjoy! To complete the dish, pair with a green salad and garnish the pie with additional thyme leaves, lightly seasoning the top with a bit of flaky salt plus some freshly cracked pepper.

**Notes:** if you want to make enough to feed 4, or two people twice, you may want to use a medium-large pan so as to fit double the amount of ingredients.

At first I thought the portion size was tiny but neither of us could finish it (I took the leftover and rolled into a ball to eat as a truffle later). I went with a super dark chocolate. I used gochugaru instead of chili flakes because I like the flavor more but to compensate, needed to use a tad more of it to get more heat. The salt flakes made the dish for me. Served with whipped cream (with vanilla and a tiny bit of maple syrup) to balance the richness of the dessert. I think I will use a bit more avocado next time (hard to judge a medium avocado) to add a little more creaminess to the finished product.

* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Fill up a pot with water, place it on the burner, and turn it on. Put a lid on to speed up the boiling process.
2. Unpack the smoked salmon and - using kitchen scissors - cut into thin strips, ¼ to ½.
3. Remove the thyme leaves from the stem but also keep a couple of stems with the leaves on for garnish. 
4. Once the pasta water starts to boil, add a generous amount of kosher salt (about 1-½ Tbsp) and 8 oz of penne. 
5. Cook according to the instructions on the package (or slightly less to keep it nice and al dente).
6. When the pasta has a couple of minutes left to go, melt 2 tablespoon butter in a large saute pan over medium heat.
7. Stir in ½ c heavy cream, about half of the salmon, and half of the thyme leaves. Dont let it boil, just simmer for a minute. 
8. Add ½ c pasta water, ½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper, and ½ teaspoon kosher salt and gently cook for about four minutes. Stir a few times.
9. Taste and add more salt if necessary but dont forget: by adding the rest of the uncooked smoked salmon before serving, that will add a little more saltiness anyway.
10. Drain the pasta and toss into the saucepan with the sauce. Give it a gentle stir until the penne is evenly covered. 
11. Divide among two plates (for a main course) or four plates (for an appetizer) and top with the remaining salmon and thyme leaves.

Prep time: about 3 hours (2-3 hours proofing included)

Cook time: 20 minutes

Serves: 8 Large slices

**Pizza Dough:**

**Ingredients**

* 2 &amp; 1/2 Cups of Bread Flour (All Purpose)
* 1 Cup Water, luke warm
* 1 Tsp Active Dry Yeast (Instant Yeast)
* 1 &amp; 1/2 Tsp Sugar
* 1 Tsp Salt
* 2 Tbsp Olive Oil (for Pan and coating dough)

**Directions:**

1. In a cup or in the stand mixer add water, sugar, and yeast.  Whisk to combine.  Set aside for 10 minutes to activate the yeast.
2. Grease a 13""x9"" pan with cooking spray and olive oil, be sure to get all corners and sides.
3. Once the yeast is active, add the flour and mix until dough forms into a ball and begins to form gluten by stretching.
4. Allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes to hydrate and build more gluten.  This is called Autolyse.
5. After 10 minutes, the dough should expand a little, and should stretch without tearing. Add the salt, and mix/knead the dough for another 8-10 minutes.
6. Remove the dough to a floured surface, and gentley form it into a ball.
7. Place the dough into the greased pan, coat it with some olive oil to prevent drying, cover the pan with plastic wrap, and allow it to proof for 15 minutes.  This will soften the dough so we can form it into the pan.
8. After 15 minutes, press and push the dough flat, and expand the dough to all edges and corners of the pan.  Cover it again with plastic wrap, and allow it to proof for 2-3 hours at room temperature, or in the oven on ""Proof""
9. After 2-3 hours, it should have tripled in volume.
10. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 C)
11. Top the pizza with Cheese as the first layer, then pizza sauce, and then preferred toppings.  Be sure to put extra cheese on the edge for a crispy crust from the burnt cheese (Frico)
12. Once oven reaches 500 F (260 C) place the pan on lowest rack to bake for 15 minutes.
13. After 15 minutes, the cheese should be slightly burnt on top, and the pizza should have crispy edge.
14. Remove the pizza from the oven, and allow it to rest for 5 minutes or more before serving.
15. Enjoy!!

**Ingredients:**

* 3 1/2 Cups of Bread Flour
* 1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees)
* 2 Tbsp neutral vegetable Oil
* 2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
* 1 Packet of Innstant or rapid-rise yeast (2 1/2 Tsp)
* 4 Tsp Kosher salt + and extra to sprinkle on top
* 1/2 cup baking soda

**Directions:**

1. In the bowl of the stand mixer, combine water, yeast, oil and sugar.  Whisk the mixture, and let is stand for 3-5 minutes.
2. Once the yeast has activated, add flour and 4 Tsp of salt to the stand mixer bowl.  Using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed for 5 minutes until the dough detaches from the sides.
3. Turn out the dough onto a work surface that's lightly coated with flour, and knead for a minute to form a dough ball.
4. Place the dough ball into a lightly oil coated bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow it to proof at room temperature for 1 hour, should double in size.Once the dough has doubled in size, deflate the dough gently and extract it from the bowl to a work surface.  Cut the dough into 12 even pieces.  Cover the pieces to prevent drying.
5. Lightly flour a baking sheet.  Take a 1 of the 12 pieces of dough, and roll it into a 20""-24"" string, then lay it down into a u-shape.  Take two ends of the U, and cross them twice, and then fold them towards the bottom of the U and press the ends to the sides of the U.  This forms the pretzel.  Transfer the  pretzel to the floured baking sheet to rise for 20 minutes.
6. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 C) Bring 8 cups of water to a boil, and add the baking soda.  Boil each pretzel into the baking soda for 30 seconds total, 15 seconds for each side.  Once boiled, transfer to a cooling rack and allow the pretzel to rest for 5 minutes.
7. Wipe the flour from the baking sheet, and oil with 1-2 Tbsp of oil.  Sprinkle the baking sheet with salt.  Transfer all boiled pretzels to the baking sheet.  Sprinkle additional salt on top of pretzels before baking.
8. Place the baking sheet into the oven on middle rack for one sheet at a time, and upper middle and lower middle for two baking sheets at a time.  For two baking sheets at a time, switch and rotate the sheets half-way through the baking time.  Bake for 15-20 minutes until pretzels are dark brown.
9. Once baked, remove the pretzels from the baking sheet to a cooling rack, and allow to cool for 10 minutes.

**Notes:**

* Once you've mastered this recipe, you can modify it for interesting and tasty variations.  Switch up the recipe, and try a different type of sugar (molasses, maple syrup etc), instead of oil try melted butter or ghee.
* You can also make these in batches, and store them in the freezer for later, just thaw them out and heat them up at 300 F for 5 minutes in the oven, or in the air fryer.",3455

2022-02-10,39,"Chinese Pickled Chopped Chilies","doubleapowpow","I found this on the internet and have only skimmed it, fwiw.

&gt;You're particularly interested in the role of sugar vs. salt, not lactobacillus vs. yeast. The simple answer to that question is that lactobacilli are salt-tolerant, while yeast is much less so. So adding salt gives the lactobacilli a headstart in converting the sugar present in your pre-pickles into lactic acid, and causes any yeast not killed by the salt to starve, and thus not produce much alcohol.

&gt;If you add more sugar on top of the salt, it won't cause alcohol production because the yeast will still be retarded by the salt, while the lactobacilli are not. You will just get really, REALLY sour pickles because the lactobacilli will convert all that extra sugar into acid as well.

&gt;That said, you can still get alcohol in your ferment. If you initially bite into a pickle and it's fizzy, that's a sign of alcohol. The yeast, while slowed down, is still going to grab some sugar for itself at the beginning and produce both alcohol and carbon dioxide. So carbonation itself is a sign that there is alcohol in your ferment.

&gt;That doesn't mean it's strong enough to make you feel anything, but it's important to remember if anyone consuming the ferment is on probation, or young, or pregnant, or a tee-totaler, or anything else you can think of. I've heard stories of children going to the hospital with high blood alcohol from drinking too much water kefir -- which is NOT a salty lacto-ferment, but still makes a point worth considering. I also know someone who failed a mandatory blood test because she drank kombucha, characterized by acetic acid and friends, not realizing that it could contain trace amounts of alcohol (luckily she managed to explain things and get out of trouble).

&gt;So, if you wanted to have an alcoholic pickle, you'd want to 1) leave out the salt, 2) inoculate with yeast to ensure that lactobacillus (or assorted nightmare bugs) don't manage to outcompete the naturally present yeasts, and 3) control the oxygen present. Adding sugar should be optional, but would be recommended I think.

&gt;[I don't drink alcohol, personally, so I wouldn't know, but I think if you're drinking pickle-born booze, you'll either want it sweet or really, really strong. That way you either won't have to taste it or won't have to think about it very long.]

&gt;I should also point out I don't make explicitly alcoholic ferments, so I'm not a practiced expert. But, the general rule is that you should initially use an aerobic ferment before introducing an airlock and creating an anaerobic environment. That's for two reasons. The first is that yeast can use both oxygen and sugar to produce alcohol, but only require sugar. So, Initially, to get the best of both worlds, you allow the yeast both. However, after a short period of time, if continually exposed to oxygen, the newly produced alcohol will start being converted into acetic acid by other bacteria. That means vinegar. If you take away the oxygen, vinegar doesn't happen.

&gt;That's why kombucha and kefir, for example don't become strongly alcoholic since they ferment entirely in an aerobic environment. Alcohol IS produced by the yeast, but is then in turn converted into various acids by the various strains of bacteria present. This is also why many people choose to perform a secondary ferment with kombucha and beer (although I only know kombucha thoroughly), where they add more sugar, in the form of fruit or flavorings, then cut off the oxygen supply and let the yeast work for a few days while many of the acid-producing bacteria take a backseat. This produces a fizzier drink, which indicates increased alcohol production. Kombucha is still very mild compared to other drinks that are intended to be alcoholic, but it's still worth remembering.",3820

For lots more info, including photo instructions, tips, tricks, and variations, please visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/cinnamon-roll-donuts/](https://maplewoodroad.com/cinnamon-roll-donuts/)

**INGREDIENTS*****Dough For Cinnamon Roll Donuts***

* 1 c warm milk
* 2-½ teaspoon instant or active dry yeast
* ½ c granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* ¼ c butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 c flour, sifted

***Cinnamon Filling***

* ¾ c light brown sugar, packed
* 2 tablespoon cinnamon
* ½ c butter, softened

***Cream Cheese Frosting***

* 6 oz cream cheese, softened
* 1-½ c powdered sugar
* S c butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

***Additional***

* Canola oil for frying (enough to fill a stovetop pot several inches deep)

**INSTRUCTIONS*****Making The Dough***

1. In a bowl, mix together warm milk and yeast, and then let it sit for several minutes to activate the yeast (while this step isn't really necessary with instant yeast, it doesn't hurt either).
2. Then, add the sugar, melted butter, eggs, salt, and vanilla, and mix well.
3. Finally, add the flour and mix with a dough hook until it forms a ball and pulls away from the sides. The dough will still be quite sticky at this point.
4. Remove the dough from the bowl and, on a lightly floured surface, knead by hand for an additional 5 minutes.

***First Rising Of Dough***

1. Lightly coat a large bowl with oil or cooking spray.
2. Place the dough in the bowl and lightly cover with a clean kitchen towel.
3. Leave in a warm spot for about 1-½ hours or until the dough has doubled in size.

***Adding The Filling***

1. While the dough is proofing, make the filling. In a bowl, simply mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until it forms a paste.
2. Once the dough has doubled in size, it's time to roll it out. On a lightly floured surface (or using silicone mats), roll out the dough until it measures approximately 14"" x 20"".
3. Next, spread the filling across the entire surface. I've found that the easiest way to do this is by dropping spoonfuls here and there and then gently spreading it out using a rubber spatula, being careful not to tear the dough.

***Forming The Donuts***

1. Now fold the dough in half by grabbing a short end and carefully pulling it all the way across.
2. Slice off the edges to make clean borders around the dough.
3. Then, slice the dough into 12 equal strips.
4. Twist each of those dough strips several times and pinch the ends tightly together.

***Second Rising Of Dough***

1. Place formed doughnuts on a lined tray and cover lightly with a towel.
2. Let them rest again for about 30 minutes.
3. Note: They will only rise slightly during this time.

***Deep Frying Donuts***

1. Once the donuts are almost finished their second rising, starting heating up the oil on the stove.
2. Pour the canola oil into a pot so that it's several inches deep and attach a candy thermometer to the side.
3. Turn on the stove to medium heat. Our goal here is for the oil to reach between 350	 and 375	, the optional temperature range for deep frying. This will take at least 15 minutes. Make sure the oil temperature stabilizes within this range.
4. Once your oil has reached the proper temperature, it's time to fry the donuts!
5. Using a stainless steel spider, gently place one donut at a time into the oil.
6. Let the donut fry for 40 seconds, then gently turn it over and let the second side cook for 20 seconds.
7. Using a spider or tongs, quickly but carefully remove from the pot and place on a wire cooling rack.

***Cream Cheese Frosting***

1. Place softened cream cheese, powdered sugar, melted butter, and vanilla extract in a bowl.
2. If using a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment. Otherwise, mix well with a spoon until smooth.
3. Once the donuts have cooled, drizzle or spread the frosting over them in any beautiful way you wish.

* High gluten flour  300 gr.
* Salt  1 tsp.
* Sugar  1 tsp.
* Vinegar  1 tbsp.
* Oil  1 tbsp.
* Water  150 ml.

* Cheese - 50 gr.
* 1 eggs
* Feta or white cheese - 100 gr.
* Natural yogurt - 1 tbsp

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions**:

1. Start the food processor and add 150 grams of water at room temperature. The goal is to gather the dough into a ball on the sides of the bowl. If this does not happen add another spoonful of water. Let the food processor run for another 20 seconds, but not more than a minute for the whole process, because the protein will tighten too much. Of course, you can also make the dough by hand, but then you will have to knead it several times.
2. Take the dough and the dry parts out on the workbench and knead until everything is incorporated, and the dough is smooth. This takes no more than 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 3 relatively equal parts and knead them again. It is extremely important here to pinch all the seams on the bottom of the dough. Otherwise, when you start to stretch the dough, it will have weak points that can tear.
3. The next step is to take 100 grams of room temperature butter, flatten the balls of dough to the shape of a disc, and put plenty of butter on both sides. Cover them in a bowl and set them aside for an hour. 
4. Use the time to prepare the different fillings for the types of pastries. Start by slicing 50 grams of salami in rounds and then in halves. Also cut 50 grams of cheese into cubes. For the second pastries, break an egg, crumble 50 grams of white cheese or feta and add a teaspoon of plain yogurt. Depending on the saltiness of the cheese, you can also add salt.
5. I will show you 3 types of preparation. For the first pastry, fold the phyllo in half. You do not need to add extra butter or oil due to the large amount of butter used. Put the stuffing of cheese, salami, and hot jalapeno pepper from a jar on two-thirds of the phyllo and add my secret sauce. Namely, 1-2 tablespoons of the liquid from the peppers jar. It will not only contribute to the taste but when baking it will create steam in the pastry, which will help with its rise. Wrap the pastry in triangle shapes, making sure that it is no more than 3-4 times to ensure proper baking. Finally, wrap the edges under the pastry and place it in the baking tray. out the corners of the dough at the end. When the diameter of the dough becomes about 30 cm (12 inches), lift one end of the dough and run your hand under its center. The air left underneath helps a lot with the stretching. Follow the same steps on all sides. Once the dough is stretched, stick it on the part of the workbench without butter. This allows the phyllo to not shrink back. Continue to pull slowly and calmly without stretching the dough too much. If the protein tightens, let it rest for a minute. Finally, stretch the edges along the entire length of the phyllo so that they are as thin as possible. With this the sheet of phyllo is ready
6. I will show you 3 types of preparation. For the first pastry, fold the phyllo in half. You do not need to add extra butter or oil due to the large amount of butter used.

Wrap the pastry in triangle shapes, making sure that it is no more than 3-4 times to ensure proper baking. Finally, wrap the edges under the pastry and place it in the baking tray.
7. For the second type crumble 50 grams of white cheese or feta above the middle of the phyllo and wrap on both sides. For all pastries, it is important to try to keep as much air as possible in the phyllo so that the pastries rise during the baking and there are no raw dough parts. Close the phyllo like a book and place it in the baking tray.
8. For the 3rd type of pie, it is important to stretch the crust into an elongated shape. Otherwise, It will have too many layers of dough  
when rolling. Put the stuffing on two-thirds of the phyllo again and start rolling. Make the first two rolls very loose, and finally, roll them up completely. Turn the edges towards the center, but also leave room for them to expand during baking.
9. When done baking, cover them with a clean towel for 15-20 minutes.

2. To melt the caramels, assemble a double boiler and place caramels in, adding your milk and salt and stirring until silky smooth. Set aside. 
3. On top of your cookies, spread a light layer of your melted caramel and let cool for 2-3 minutes so you have an adhesive surface. 
4. With the remaining caramel, mix in your toasted coconut shreds. Begin to top your cookies with this mixture. 
5. Once your cookies are topped with the initial layer of caramel and the coconut/caramel topping, you can melt your chocolate with the same double boiler method we used before. Set aside once melted. 
6. Take your cookies one at a time, dunking the bottom of them into the chocolate, and placing on a cooling rack or parchment paper sheet. Once all bottoms are coated with chocolate, use the remaining chocolate to drizzle on top of the cookies. 

THATS IT! Your homemade somoas are done. Indulge, enjoy, and further argue about the best Girl Scout Cookie.

2022-02-07,37,"South Indian Mutton Curry","MatchesMaloneTDK","This is a homemade recipe for Mutton Pulusu, a common type of spicy Mutton curry in Telugu states of Southern India. I used a very hot variant of Guntur chillies for the red chillies and the chilli powder. But they can substituted with any very hot chilli powder and Thai chillies to the same amount as mentioned below. This recipe makes 4-5 portions and it can be enjoyed with any white rice (I recommend basmati) or roti. This recipe can also be used for chicken, but please keep in mind, it will take a lot less time to cook the chicken. If you do not have ghee, just use 2 tbsp extra oil. You can also add a few curry leaves to your curry at the start with chillies and a few with the other herbs at the end if you wish.

""	2 lb sirloin steak (cut into 1½-inch by 1-inch)  
""	2 tbsp oil  
""	1½ tsp ground black pepper  
""	1½ tsp salt  
""	1½ tsp soy sauce  


Instructions  
1.	Cut steak into 1½-inch by 1-inch pieces.  
2.	Whisk together oil, pepper, salt, and soy sauce.  
3.	Add steak to bowl and toss together with sauce until coated.  
4.	Preheat air fryer.  
5.	Cook in air fryer at 400°F for 12 minutes.  
6.	Serve as main dish along with steamed rice, vegetables, or noodles.  


Notes:

More information about this recipe can be found [Here](https://www.swankyrecipes.com/air-fryer-juicy-steak-bites.html?). Cheers!  


Flavor Variations

  
Onions: Add some cut up white or yellow onions to your bowl of sauce and toss well before cooking.  


Mushrooms: Steak and mushrooms go hand in hand. Simply add the mushrooms to the bowl to coat in the sauce with a little more oil and air fry them along with the pieces of steak.  


Spices: Other spices that go great with soy sauce are garlic, ginger, paprika, cumin, coriander, chili powder, lemon juice, and toasted sesame seeds.  


Sauces: Serve the steak bites with a chimichurri sauce, hummus, tzatziki sauce, A1 sauce, barbecue sauce, mustard cream, butter garlic sauce, steak Diane sauce, Worcestershire sauce, or Cajun butter sauce.  


Cheese: I cant get enough of blue cheese crumbles on my steak. Once its done cooking, add some blue cheese crumbles to the steak and allow it to slightly melt into the meat. Many famous steakhouses now offer this option and its one that I really do like. It add a tangy sharp taste to the steak.  


Butter: Toss the air fryer steak in a bowl with butter once its done cooking. Not only will this ingredient add moisture, but flavor to it as well.  


Garlic: If marinating, add the garlic at the beginning to lock in even more garlic flavor and then cook it according to the recipe directions. If youre like me and enjoy raw garlic, mince the garlic and toss it in a bowl with a little melted butter to serve over the beef while plating it for dinner.",2069

**Easy No Knead Focaccia**

* 300g Bread Flour
* 300g All-Purpose Flour
* 14g salt
* 2 tsp instant yeast
* 1 tsp sugar
* 20g good quality Olive Oil
* 535g lukewarm water
* Extra Oil for greasing the dough and pan, and for finishing the bread
* Flaky Sea Salt (optional)

**Method**

1. In a large bowl, combine the bread flour, all-purpose flour, Kosher salt, yeast, and sugar. Add the Olive Oil  and water, and mix with a spatula until a shaggy dough forms and there are no dry parts. The dough is wet and sticky. This is normal. The water quantity is correct.
2. Don't freak out, you will be fine.This is normal. Super wet dough = super fluffy focaccia. The pan is there to provide structure when it bakes, so it's ok that it's wet and sticky! It might look a bit different to mine but if you have weighed your ingredients, all will be ok, promise.
3. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and leave to stand for 5 minutes.
4. Perform a set of stretch and folds on the dough. To do this, wet your hands, then take a section of the dough and stretch it up and fold it onto itself. Rotate the bowl 90° and repeat the process. Repeat this two more times until you have gone around the bowl, then do one more set of four stretch and folds around the bowl (a total of 8 stretch and folds).
5. Cover the bowl with the tea towel and leave to sit for 2 minutes.Repeat the stretch and folding and resting process two more times, for a total of three rounds of stretch and folds, each two minutes apart.
6. Drizzle the surface of the dough with a little olive oil, and turn the dough over in the bowl to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid (to make sure it doesn't dry out), then place in the fridge overnight, a minimum of 12 hours but up to 2 days.
7. Generously drizzle a 9""x13"" (23cmx33cm) non stick baking pan with olive oil.
8. Turn the risen dough out into the pan and turn it to fully coat it in the oil. Shape into a rough rectangle shape by pressing it down with your oiled fingers and tucking edges and corners in if needed. Leave to sit for 5 minutes to relax.
9. Gently spread the dough toward the edges of the pan using your oiled fingers. It does not have to reach all the way - just encourage it to spread out slightly more.Drizzle the surface of the dough with a little more olive oil so that it does not dry out.
10. Leave the pan in a warm spot, uncovered, to rise, until doubled in size, puffy, and jiggly, anywhere from 2 to 4 hours depending on your environment. Toward the end of the rising process, preheat the oven to 450°f / 230°c (conventional, not fan), and arrange a rack in the middle of the oven
11. Drizzle the dough with olive oil, then oil your fingers and use them to dimple the dough all over, pressing your fingers almost to the bottom of the pan. Bubbles will form in the dough - do not pop them, just leave them be. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt if using.
12. Immediately transfer to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown on the surface and pulling away from the sides of the pan.
13. Remove from the oven and allow to stand for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to prevent the bottom from getting soggy.
14. Leave to cool then slice into pieces using a bread knife. Store leftovers lightly wrapped at room temperature.",3423

* Food processor
* Large, oven-safe casserole dish
* 2 Large pots
* Colander or strainer

## Ingredients

## Turkey meatballs:

* 1 tablespoon dashi granules omit if you dont have it\*
* 2 cups water
* 4 scallions trimmed
* 2 shallots peeled and quartered
* 23 Thai chili peppers or crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 tablespoon yuzu miso
* 2 tablespoons shoyu or low-sodium soy sauce
* ¼ cup water
* 1 pound ground turkey
* 1 teaspoon shichimi togarashi
* 2 eggs
* T cup panko more as needed
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil for frying
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Ramen broth:

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and sliced into half-moons
* 8 ounces mushrooms torn or sliced depending on the variety
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons mirin
* 1 tablespoon dashi granules omit if you cant find it
* ½ cup tahini
* 2 tablespoons chili oil
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 teaspoon sesame oil
* Salt and pepper to taste

## For serving:

* 16 ounces ramen noodles
* 4 eggs
* Shichimi togarashi
* Sliced scallions

## Instructions

## Preheat oven to 275ºF.

## Prepare the dashi braising broth:

* In a large oven-safe casserole dish, combine the 2 cups of water and the dashi granules. If you cannot find dashi, use chicken stock here instead. Set aside.

## Prepare the meatballs:

* Combine the scallions, shallot, Thai chili peppers, miso, shoyu, and water in a food processor. Blend until paste forms.
* Place the turkey in a bowl along with the shichimi togarashi, eggs, panko, and the miso paste mixture from the food processor. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Mix with your hands, being careful not to overmix! Add more panko if the mixture is too loose.
* Take a teaspoon of the mixture and cook in a hot skillet or microwave to taste seasoning. Adjust the seasonings as necessary.

## Fry the meatballs:

* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the first batch of meatballs in an even layer, turning every 23 minutes until golden brown all over and mostly cooked through. Transfer to the casserole dish with the dashi stock. Continue frying the meatballs in layers until all meatballs have been fried.
* Transfer the casserole dish to the preheated oven as you prepare the rest of the ramen base. *Note: Don't worry if the meatballs don't cook all the way through in the oven; you'll boil them in the ramen broth at the end to fully complete the cooking process!*

## Prepare the ramen broth:

* Wipe out the pot used to fry the meatballs. Heat the 1 tablespoon neutral oil over medium-high and add the sliced onions. Cook for 5 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook for 810 minutes until they turn golden brown all overseason with salt and pepper.
* Pour in the chicken stock and add the mirin and dashi granules if you have them. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.

## Finish the meatballs:

* Remove the meatballs from the oven and check the temperature. If they havent reached 165ºF yet, add them to the broth and bring them to a boil. Cook in the broth for 710 minutes or until the internal temperature of the meatball reaches 165ºF. Once the meatballs are cooked through, reduce the heat on the broth to low.

## Cook the noodles and eggs:

* Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 4 eggs to water and cook for 8 minutes. Remove from the boiling and transfer to an ice bath for 5 minutes before peeling the eggs and cutting them half.
* Add the noodles to the same water used for the eggs and boil according to package instructions. Drain, rinse and divide between 4 bowls.

## Prepare the tahini:

**Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies (makes 12)**

* 120g unsalted butter, cold from the fridge is fine
* 120g dark brown or light brown sugar
* 45g granulated sugar
* 1 large egg, at room temperature
* 1 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste
* 140g all-purpose flour
* ½ tsp kosher salt
* ½ tsp espresso powder (optional)
* ¼ tsp baking powder
* ¼ tsp baking soda
* 180g chocolate from a bar, chopped (I used 100g dark and 80g milk, use what you like here), plus extra for pressing on top, if desired

**Instructions**

1. Place the butter in a medium saucepan, and place over medium heat. Cook until the butter has melted, and then continue to cook, swirling the pan often, until the butter foams and turns golden brown and nutty - this should take 3-4 minutes.
2. Measure out 95g of the brown butter into a medium or large mixing bowl, and set aside for 15-20 minutes to cool so that it doesn't scramble your eggs.When the butter is cool, add the brown sugar and white sugar, and whisk briefly to incorporate.
3. Add the egg and whisk well for 1-2 minutes, or mix using an electric mixer, until the mixture has lightened in colour and has thickened.
4. Add the vanilla and mix well.
5. Add the flour, salt, espresso powder if using, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix to combine with a rubber spatula until there are some flour streaks remaining - this is to ensure you do not over work the dough.
6. Add the chopped chocolate and mix with a spatula to incorporate and finish incorporating the flour.
7. Line a quarter sheet pan or other container with parchment paper. Using a 2 Tbsp cookie scoop, scoop balls of dough (approx 55g) , arranging them on the parchment (they can be touching). Cover with plastic wrap or a lid and chill the dough for at least 30 minutes.
8. 10 minutes into the chilling period, preheat the oven to 350°f / 180°c.  Line two sheet pans with parchment paper.
9. Arrange 6 cookie dough balls onto the pan. If desired, flatten each ball of dough, press more chocolate on the top, and roll into a ball, then space evenly on the pan.
10. Bake the cookies for 11-13 minutes, or until set around the edges and golden brown. Bake for closer to 11 minutes for still gooey inside, or 12-13 for more set cookies.
11. Remove from the oven, and if desired, use a cookie cutter slightly bigger than the cookies to 'scoot' them into a round shape.
12. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt if using. Leave to cool on the pan for 10-15 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack.
13. Repeat the baking process with the remaining 6 balls of dough.
14. Store leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature.",2772

2022-01-30,28,"Roast Cauliflower with Spiced Chickpeas &amp; Green Herb Tahini","leviathanfood","This recipe uses for dried chickpeas, which first need to be soaked in water for a minimum of ten hours. They will triple in size during this process, so use a container big enough to accommodate this. Canned chickpeas can be substituted if time is an issue. In both cases be sure that they are completely drained and dried before roasting to ensure crispiness. If you enjoyed this I have more original recipes on my website [Leviathan Food](https://www.leviathanfood.com/).

**INGREDIENTS**

***CAULIFLOWER &amp; CHICKPEAS***

*1 large head cauliflower*

*sumac*

*100g dried chickpeas*

*200ml water*

*1 heaped tsp. paprika*

*1 heaped tsp. dried coriander*

*1 pomegranate*

***GREEN HERB TAHINI***

*2 heaped tbsp. light tahini*

*1 heaped tbsp. natural yoghurt*

*1 tbsp. honey*

*20g flat leaf parsley*

*20g fresh coriander*

*20g fresh chives*

*20g fresh basil* 

*small sprig fresh dill*

*6 tbsp. light olive oil*

*juice of 1 lemon*

*water*

**METHOD**

1.) Preheat oven to 200° C (390° F). Oil a baking sheet well and spread the chickpeas out. Roll them around to ensure an even coating and season with coarse salt and pepper. When the oven has heated set them inside and roast for around 30 mins, giving a toss every ten mins or so. Remove when golden brown. Immediately add paprika and dried coriander mix and more salt if needed. Mix well to coat. 

2.) Transfer chickpeas to a bowl and set aside. Wipe out baking tray and coat with fresh oil. Remove the outer leaves of the cauliflower and begin by cutting thick slabs from the centre of the head outwards. Don't worry if the outer bits start to fall apart. Place them all on the baking tray and add some extra oil. Season and roast for about 25 mins until toasty and darkened.

3.) Add tahini, lemon, yoghurt, honey, oil and herbs to high-powered blender or good food processor. Add pinch of salt and mix with pulses before going onto high setting. Add a few drops of water while mixing to help blend and emulsify. You are looking for slightly runny and pourable consistency. 

4.) To serve lay chickpeas down with cauliflower on top before liberally pouring over the green tahini sauce. You can use the baking tray to cut down on washing up. Sprinkle sumac over the top and add pomegranate seeds. You can buy these separately or cut the fruit open and hit the back of it with a wooden spoon to release the seeds. Garnish with flat leaf parsley.",2415

2022-01-30,79,"Onion Bhajis with Chilli Sauce","mienczaczek","Do you see them? chilling by that chilli sauce? One is about to jump in!

Onion Bhaji is one of my favourite Indian appetisers. I love their crunch and delicious inside. Dip them in a nice sauce and stuff it in your mouth, absolutely fantastic!

Super easy to prepare, served with various dips like mango chutney, mint yoghurt or chilli sauce. On this occasion I prepared simple chilli sauce from my Indian friend's recipe, try it yourself and you will not regret it.

**Ingredients for 15 Bhajis:**

\* 4 medium or 2 large white onions, cut in half and sliced

\* 1 green chilli, seeds removed and finely sliced

\* 1 medium potato, cut into fine matchsticks

\* 1tbsp of garlic and ginger paste

\* a handful of chopped fresh coriander

\* 1tsp of salt

\* 1tsp of mild chilli powder

\* 1tsp of ground coriander

\* 1tsp of turmeric

\* 1tsp of ground cumin

\* 1 large egg (you can skip for the vegan version, reduce the flour by 50g)

\* 150g (5.3oz) of gram flour (made of chickpeas)

\* 1L of vegetable oil for deep-fat frying

**Ingredients for chilli sauce:**

\* 1 red chilli, seeds removed and sliced

\* 1 red bell pepper, diced

\* 1 garlic clove

\* juice of a half lemon

\* 50ml of water

\* 1/4tsp of salt

\* 1/4tsp of sugar

\* 1/4tsp of ground cumin

**Instructions for Bhajis:**

1. Preheat a deep fat fryer or a small pot with oil to 170C (340F) (you can check pot oil temperature with an electric probe)
2. Mix sliced onions with potato matchsticks, green chilli, garlic ginger paste, fresh coriander, salt and spices. Do so until all onions are coated with colours.
3. Mix in one egg to coat the onions then add chickpea flour, combine until no signs of dry flour is left.
4. Use gloves for protection, take a small amount of Bhaji mix and shape in your hands into a ball (do not compress the mix) put it gently into the hot oil. Cook Bhajis until golden-brown then flip upside down for another minute or so to colour the topside. I recommend using a spider strainer or tongs to remove Bhajis from the oil. Place them onto a kitchen paper to drain excess fat.
5. Do it in a few batches until all Bhajis are done, serve straight away or reheat in the oven later before serving.

**Instructions for Chilli sauce:**

1. Place all the ingredients in the bullet like this one and blend into a smooth chilli sauce.
2. Transfer into a bowl to allow air bubbles to escape, then transfer into a serving dish.

Recipe can be found here: https://www.thespeltkitchen.com/airfryer-nutella-doughnut/





INGREDIENTS


- 125ml water

- 125ml milk

- 60g butter

- 25g fresh yeast 

- 400-450g flour 

- 2 teaspoons vanilla sugar

- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg

- ¼ teaspoon cinnamon

- 65g sugar

- Nutella 

- Vegetable oil or spray (for cooking)

- Icing sugar (for sprinkling)


INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a pan, heat the water, milk and butter, just until the butter is starting to melt. Remove from the heat and allow to cool until it just lukewarm. Then sprinkle in the yeast. Stir until combined and leave for around 10 minutes to activate.

2. In a large bowl, mix around 350g of flour with the sugar, vanilla sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon. Pour in the wet ingredients and gradually add more flour as needed. Knead for around five minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic and then place back in the bowl and cover with a towel (see note 4). Leave in a warm place until it has pretty much doubled in size.

3. Drop dollops of Nutella (around 1-2 teaspoons each) on a baking tray lined with grease-proof paper. Place in the freezer for an hour to harden up.

4. Knock back the dough and briefly knead again, and then divide into 8 roughly equal sized balls, pulling the outsides in to make a nice, smooth finish. Take each ball and flatten in the palm of your hand and place one of the Nutella dollops in the centre. Pull over the outsides of the dough so that the Nutella is completely covered.

5. Place the dough balls on a baking tray lined with grease-proof paper, cover, and leave in a warm place to proof for around 45-60 minutes.

6. Actifry: remove the rotary part of your Actifry, then sprinkle in a touch of vegetable oil. Place the lid on and let it run for a couple of minutes, then gently place several doughnuts in (you will need to cook them in batches). Brush a little oil over the top. Because the rotary part is not being used, you will manually need to shuffle the doughnuts around to ensure an even cooking.

7. Airfryer: spray or grease your Airfryer basket with oil. Do the same with the top of the doughnuts. Place them in the basket with a nice amount of space between them (you will need to cook them in batches) for about four minutes each on 175°C.

8. When golden brown, remove from the Airfryer and leave to cool on some kitchen paper. Sprinkle liberally with icing sugar and scoff them down while still warm!

**Prepare the herbs:**

**Cook the orzo:**

Once the soup is boiling, add the orzo. Stir regularly to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Cook for 10 minutes until al dente.

* Cinnamon 1 tsp  
  
* Sugar 1/4 cup  
  
Recipe:  
  
1. Mix Sugar, Milk &amp; Yeast until sugar is dissolved, wait for it to show life  
  
2. Add Yeast mixture, 2 egg yolks, and bread flour to a mixing bowl  
  
3. Knead until dough is whole and not sticky

6. Make each 36g into a taught ball, pinch the seams  
  
7. Let it rise for 30 min  
  
8. Flatten the balls a bit, use a ring to make holes in the flattened balls (save the holes for frying too!)

11. Cover the donut with cinnamon sugar and enjoy!

  
  
Tips  
  
* Dust the surface your working in with flour before making the balls, makes it easier to lift the donuts to the fryer  
  
* 36g was a sweet spot for me in terms of size, 40g was a bit too big  
  
* if you mishandled the donuts while cutting the holes or while anything really, and make dents, do not worry. The frying will fill out any imperfections as the bubbles fill it up  
  
* cinnamon sugar really is the easiest topping and really warms you up too! Especially if you eat the donut while it's still warm.

2022-01-24,4,"Classic Chicken Tikka Masala","shots-by-leo","hi there! be ready for a nap after eating this, but it is so worth it.   


**FOR THE MARINADE:** 

* Roughly 2lbs of chicken thighs
* 1 cup of plain yogurt
* 2 tablespoons of minced garlic
* 2 teaspoons of garam masala
* 1-2 tablespoons of ginger
* 2 teaspoons of cumin
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 1 teaspoon of ground red chili powder
* salt, to taste

**FOR THE CURRY:**

* 2-3 tablespoons of vegetable oil or equivalent 
* 2 tablespoons of butter
* 1 large yellow or white onion, diced
* 1 tablespoon of ginger, grated (or powder is fine)
* 2 teaspoons of garam masala
* 2 teaspoons of cumin
* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1-2 teaspoons of ground coriander
* 14-16oz tomato sauce
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* salt to taste
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 teaspoon brown sugar
* 1/2 cup of water if needed (if curry is too thick)
* garnish with fresh cilantro 

**INSTRUCTIONS:**  


1. Starting with your chicken, put all the thighs in a bowl with your marinade ingredients. Stir to evenly incorporate and let marinate for 30 minutes or overnight (if you're feeling ambitious and want to prep ahead of time.)
2. Heat your oil in a large skillet. Begin to get a beautiful brown sear on each sides of your chicken thighs, being careful not to crowd the pan. Repeat this process until you have seared all of your chicken, about 2-3 minutes each side. Set chicken aside, we'll cook it the rest of the way in the curry.
3. In the same pan, melt your butter and add your onions, garlic, and ginger to sautee for a few minutes or until fragrant. Once fragrant and soft, add your garam masala, cumin, coriander and turmeric. You're only going to fry these spices together for under a minute, you don't want to burn them. 
4. Time to pour in your tomato sauce! You can also salt this to taste, and also add in your chili powders. The chili powder is optional though, depending on your spice level tolerance. Simmer the sauce for 20 minutes, you want it to thicken and all the spices to get together. You want it to be a dark red color. 
5. Now, add in your cream and sugar. You will also add your chicken, and submerge it in the sauce, allowing the chicken to fully cook in the sauce for about 10 minutes. The sauce should end being thick. If needed, there is where you'd add your water, if you'd like a looser curry. 
6. Serve with rice and naan, garnish with cilantro. Or green onions, if you have the curse of cilantro tasting like soap.

2022-01-24,31,"Vegan Tom Kha","BushyEyes","**Recipe here originally: [Vegan Tom Kha](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/vegan-tom-kha/)**


This is one of my favorite soups of all time. It's so spicy and flavorful and is perfect for a cold day. I started reading more about it and realized it was actually pretty easy to make at home, so I gave it a go today. The only real challenge with this one is sourcing the ingredients, but I have substitutions listed below!

Normally, you'll see it at the restaurants as *tom kha gai*

*Tom* means soup, *kha* means galangal, and *gai* means chicken

I made a vegan version, so I didn't use any chicken though thin slices of chicken can be added during the second simmer if you eat meat!

* **Shiitake mushrooms**: replace with any mushroom
* **Galangal:** replace with ginger root
* **Lime leaves:** replace with juice and zest from 1 lime
* **Lemongrass:** Omit if you cant find it
* **Thai chili peppers:** Your favorite hot pepper, such as serrano or jalapeño, or use crushed red pepper to taste
* **Vegan fish sauce:** Add more soy sauce and omit this if you cant find it. Or, use the classic fish sauce if you arent vegetarian
* **Coconut milk:** Your favorite plant-based cream or milk.

**How to serve it:**

* You can serve it simply as a soup.
* Serve with cooked rice or rice noodles
* Add torn soft tofu or thin slices of chicken to the broth to add some additional protein and heartiness to this soup.

## Equipment

* Large pot
* Slotted spoon or sieve

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon neutral oil
* 1 pound mixed mushrooms torn or sliced
* 12 lime leaves or juice and zest of 1 lime,
* 1½ inch piece of galangal peeled
* .25 ounces lemongrass about a 6-inch piece
* 4 Thai chili peppers trimmed and halved, optional
* 6 cups water
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons vegan fish sauce, optional
* 14-ounce can coconut milk
* Salt and pepper to taste

## For serving (optional):

* Cooked white rice
* Cilantro
* Chili oil
* Lime wedges

## Instructions

## Cook the mushrooms:

* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring often, for 1015 minutes until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl.

## Prepare the galangal and lemongrass:

* Place the peeled galangal on a sturdy cutting board. Use the handle of your knife or a heavy-bottomed pan and smash the galangal until crushed open. Next, remove the tough outer layers from the lemongrass and crush the same way you crushed the galangal.

## Cook the aromatics:

* Add 1 teaspoon of neutral oil to the pot and turn the heat to medium. Add the lime leaves, galangal, lemongrass, and halved Thai chili peppers. Sizzle in the pot for 1 minute until fragrant. Pour in the water and soy sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1520 minutestaste and season to your preferences.

## Strain the broth:

* Use a slotted spoon to remove all of the solids from the potalternatively, strain through a sieve. Discard the solids and return the broth to medium-high heat.

## Finish the tom kha:

* Add the coconut milk and vegan fish sauce to the pot. Bring to a low boil and then reduce heat and simmer for an additional 10 minutestaste and season to your preferences.

## To serve:

* Ladle the tom kha into bowls and serve with cooked rice, fresh cilantro, and a drizzle of chili oil. Garnish each dish with a lime wedge. Enjoy!

For full recipe, tips, tricks, and variation ideas, please visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/creamy-mushroom-pasta/](https://maplewoodroad.com/creamy-mushroom-pasta-without-cream/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 4 oz pasta of your choice
* 12 oz fresh mushrooms of your choice (portobello, cremini, shiitake), chopped
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 tablespoon butter
* 1 shallot, finely chopped (about ½ c)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 Tbsp)
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* ½ c fresh herbs, such as parsley, sage, rosemary
* ½ c white wine (or pasta water)\*
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
* ½ c pasta water
* 2 oz (½ c) finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan)
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste
* 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, or more to taste

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Start by bringing a pot of salted water to a rolling boil for the pasta.
2. Next, add a tablespoon of olive oil to your saute pan and bring to medium heat.
3. Add the chopped mushrooms and let them saute. Theyll brown on the edges and will release some of their liquid. Stir a couple of times and cook for about 4 minutes.
4. Next, add the butter, shallots, salt, and pepper, and cook for 2 minutes.
5. Add the garlic, mustard, tomato paste, and the herbs and stir very well so that everything is mixed well.
6. After just another minute (you never want to overcook the garlic or your dinner might be toast), add the wine and lemon juice.
7. Taste. If you think it needs more salt, add some. But be mindful, well still add the starchy pasta water and Parmesan, which will both add more salt.
8. Lastly, add the grated Parmesan and the pasta water and stir.

**Directions**

1. Preheat the oven to 425F/220C/200C fan. Toss the squash in a bit of olive oil and salt, then place on a baking tray and roast for around 30 minutes, or until the squash is starting to look caramelised and a bit brown on the edges.
2. In a medium saucepan on medium heat, add just enough olive oil to shallowly cover the bottom of the pot. Once the oil is hot, add in the garlic, ginger, chili(s) and turmeric, half the scallions or chives, plus a pinch of salt.
3. Once everything is all nice and fragrant, add in the carrot, celery and shallot. Cook, stirring occasionally, and leave to soften and mingle with the other flavours for a few minutes (without browning).
4. Add the roasted squash in to the pot, stir through and cook for around 5 minutes more, adding a bit more oil to the pot if things start to catch.
5. Pour in the hot water or vegetable stock, season with a bit more salt, stir, and leave to simmer gently for 15-20 minutes before blending smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning and soup thickness to your taste.

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, please visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/nutella-babka/](https://maplewoodroad.com/nutella-babka/)

**INGREDIENTS**  
***Babka Dough***

* ¾ c whole milk, warm
* S c granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 teaspoon active dry yeast
* 2 large eggs
* 3 c all purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 6 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into small cubes

***Nutella Filling***

* 1-¼ c Nutella chocolate hazelnut spread
* ¼ c unsalted butter, melted
* ¾ c finely chopped hazelnuts

***Simple Syrup***

* ½ c granulated sugar
* ½ c water  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. The first step is to let the yeast bloom for a few minutes while you gather the rest of your ingredients.
2. Stir together warm milk, sugar, vanilla, and yeast. Let sit for about 5 minutes.
3. Next, using a dough hook attachment, add the flour, salt, and eggs, and mix again at low speed.
4. Keeping the dough hook on low speed, add the butter a few cubes at a time, and then let it continue kneading on the same speed for 5 minutes. During this time, the dough will pull together nicely and form into a sticky dough.
5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot to proof for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.
6. Once the dough has doubled in size, roll it out on a lightly floured surface, until it measures approximately 14"" x 16"".
7. Cut the edges to make a rectangle shape (I like to use a pizza cutter to easily make smooth, straight lines).
8. Stir together the Nutella and melted butter.
9. Very gently spread the Nutella and butter mixture over the dough using a rubber spatula, being careful not to tear the dough, then sprinkle finely chopped hazelnuts over the spread.
10. Starting on a long side, tightly roll up the dough into a log shape.
11. Then, with the seam side facing down, slice the roll in half lengthwise, with the filling side facing up.
12. Twist the two sides and pinch the ends together to form a long braided loaf.
13. Place in a parchment lined 9"" loaf pan.
14. Lightly cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot to let it rise again for 2 hours.
15. Preheat oven to 350	.
16. Remove the plastic wrap from your loaf pan and bake the bakba on the middle rack of your oven for 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the bread comes out clean.
17. While the babka is baking, make the simple syrup.
18. Simply stir together sugar and water and simmer on the stove for a few minutes until the sugar has completely dissolved. Then remove from heat and let cool.
19. Once the babka has finished baking but while it's still warm and in the lined loaf pan, brush the simple syrup over the top. Yes, all of it!
20. Let the babka soak up all the syrup and cool completely before removing from the pan.
21. Serve and enjoy!",2819
2022-01-18,44,"Spicy Orange-Glazed Mushrooms","BushyEyes","Oh goodness. Im a mushroom fiend!

So, it depends on the variety but Ill do a breakdown:

Baby Bella, cremini, button: all the same family. The biggest issue I find is when theyre OLD - they get disgusting to me and I cant eat them. So when I make cremini or baby Bella, I look for ones that arent bruised and you cant see the brown gills (the biggest indicator of freshness is whether the cap is still tight to the stem or not&when it starts to flare out and you see all the brown gills, the mushrooms are old, and I find they cook up to be mushy and they dont brown as well as they should.) They should be firm and when you cut them open, they should be a nice pearly white color. 

Shiitake: these are almost always delicious. If theyre soft or mushy, they arent going to crisp up well. 

King oyster mushrooms (the ones with the score marks in my picture): these are amazing. You can cut the base into thick rounds and they have the same texture as scallops. You can also shred them with a fork and its ridiculously close texture-wise to shredded meat. Ive made shredded mushroom tacos before and they are soooo good. 

You can also get more interesting varieties like maitake (hen of the wood), blue oyster, or lions mane. People make crab cakes with lions mane mushrooms and they look so similar to crab its insane! Sometimes I find hen of the wood to have a funkier flavor than I like but that might just be me. 

For cooking them, you need lots of time to properly brown them. Any recipe that says to cook mushrooms for 3-5 minutes is full of shit im sorry. I take issue with it. The mushrooms should be cooked in batches and they need to release all their water and the water needs to evaporate before they can brown properly. It usually takes 15-30 mins depending on how many mushrooms you have. But once you get them good and golden brown&omg. Nothing better. Add a little vermouth and serve with some crispy sage. Soooo good! 

Hope that answers your question. Im a mushroom fiend lol = the biggest thing with mushrooms is really just freshness. If theyre wet, walk away!! It means theyre old.",2123

Get the full recipe, tips, and tricks at: [https://maplewoodroad.com/chocolate-orange-cake/](https://maplewoodroad.com/chocolate-orange-cake/)

**INGREDIENTS**  
***Chocolate Orange Cake***

* 2 c all-purpose flour, sifted
* 1-½ c granulated sugar
* ¾ c cocoa powder
* 2 teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ½ c vegetable oil
* 2 large eggs
* ½ c orange juice
* 2 tablespoon orange zest (about 1 large orange)
* ½ c whole milk
* ½ c hot, freshly brewed coffee
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Vegetable shortening or cooking spray to grease two 9"" round baking pans
* Parchment paper

***Chocolate Orange Buttercream***

* 3 sticks unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* 6 oz bittersweet chocolate bar
* ½ c heavy cream
* 3 c powdered sugar
* ¼ c orange juice
* 2 tablespoon orange zest (about 1 large orange)
* 2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* ½ c cocoa powder
* ½ teaspoon salt

***Candied Orange Slices (optional)***

* 1 large orange, cut in thin slices
* 2 c granulated sugar
* 2 c water

  
**INSTRUCTIONS**   
***Chocolate Orange Cake***

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Using vegetable shortening or cooking spray, grease two 9"" round cake pans, then place a circle of parchment to line the bottom of each.
3. Whisk together vegetable oil, eggs, orange juice, orange zest, milk, hot coffee, and vanilla.
4. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
5. Slowly add dry ingredients to wet and mix just until all ingredients are combined (but in order to keep the cake light and fluffy, don't overmix).
6. Divide batter equally between two greased and lined cake pans.
7. Bake on middle rack for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
8. Let cool a few minutes, then turn out onto a plate, remove the parchment from the bottom of each cake, and flip right side up onto cooling racks to cool completely.

***Chocolate Orange Buttercream Frosting***

1. While the cakes are cooling, make the chocolate orange buttercream frosting.
2. Break the chocolate bar into small pieces and add to a microwave-safe bowl, along with the heavy cream.
3. Microwave for 30 seconds, then stir. Then microwave in 15-second increments, stirring after each one, until smooth. This should take about 1-½ to 2 minutes total.
4. Once the chocolate and cream are melted together, let it cool on the counter for a few minutes while you start the frosting mixture.
5. Whisk softened, room temperature butter until smooth (scraping down sides of bowl as necessary).
6. Add powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, blending until smooth between each one.
7. Next, add the orange juice, vanilla extract, cocoa powder, salt, and orange zest, and mix well.
8. Finally, add the melted chocolate and mix one more time until the frosting is smooth and fluffy.

***Frosting The Cake***

1. First, apply thin layer of frosting to both 9"" cake rounds, then place in the fridge to cool and set the crumb coat (while a crumb coat is not absolutely necessary, it does help seal in any loose crumbs that get mixed into the first layer of frosting).
2. Then, finish frosting your cake by adding a nice thick layer of frosting on top of one of the cake rounds, to act as the middle layer.
3. Place the second cake on top and add frosting to the top and sides of the layer cake.  
Finally, add any decoration that your heart desires, using candied orange slices, some extra sprinkles of orange zest, and shaved chocolate.

***Candied Orange Slices (optional)***

1. Candied orange slices should be made the day before, but, in a pinch, can be made the same morning.
2. Slice an orange into thin slices (I was able to slice a large navel orange into about 12 slices).
3. Make a simple syrup by combining 2 cups of granulated sugar with 2 cups of water in a saucepan. Bring to a light boil until sugar has completely dissolved.
4. Add orange slices and turn heat down to a simmer. Simmer the orange slices for 20 minutes.
5. After 20 minutes, gently remove the orange slices and dry them.
6. Here, you have two options: Either place the orange slices on a drying rack for up to 24 hours to dry. Or, if you have a food dehydrator, place the slices on a lined tray. Turn on the dehydrator to 160°F. After about 1 hour, if you wish, twist the orange slices and hold them in place with toothpicks, then continue drying. I found that by using a dehydrator, my orange slices were dry after about 5 hours.",4498

2022-01-10,53,"Homemade Detroit-Style Pizza","shots-by-leo","To make your own Detroit-style pizza at home, you'll need...

**FOR THE DOUGH**

* 300g bread flour (2 solid cups) all purpose is fine, but you will get a denser dough. bread flour is great for a chewier yet lighter dough
* 5g instant yeast (1 teaspoon)
* 9g salt (1 generous teaspoon)
* 220g water (roughly one cup, but remove a tablespoon or so)
* olive oil as you go

**EVERYTHING ELSE**

* brick cheese, 10-14 ounces. if you can't find cheese at your local store, you can use monterey jack or a sharp white cheddar
* tomato sauce of your choice
* toppings of your choice
* optionally, whole milk mozzarella. i like adding a little bit of this so i can still get that nice stretch when it all melts. but this is not traditional, i just like it for funsies and preference.
* Lloyd pan, but a 9x13 high walled pan will work just fine.

**DIRECTIONS**

1. Making your dough: begin by whisking your flour, salt, and yeast together in a bowl. warm up your water until it's warm (I like to see if it feels like a comfortable hot-tub temperature) and add it to your flour.
2. Once the water is added, combine in a bowl until you have a shaggy dough ball form. Once you have achieved the shaggy dough ball look, let it rest for 10 minutes. 
3. After those 10 minutes, place on a floured surface and kneed until you have a smooth, cohesive ball of dough. Get a container or bowl and coat with a small layer of olive oil, and place the dough in to rise. You can keep it out at room temperature for 2-3 hours to use for dinner, or in your fridge for 2-4 days. 
4. Once your dough has had time to rise and poof, gently press and stretch it into your pan. No need to add extra olive oil for non-stick, as the dough has been stretching in oil so it will non-stick naturally.
5. If you have any toppings, put these on first!
6. Once your dough is stretched to reach the edges of your pan (and you have added your potential toppings) take your slices of brick cheese and line the edges where the dough meets the metal pan. When these melt, it will achieve those crispy cheese edges Detroit-style pies are known for. Of course, add the brick cheese to the rest of your pie as well.
7.  Optionally, tear some of your mozzarella and add it to your pizza.
8. Add your two thick rows of tomato sauce.
9. Place in your oven for 15 minutes @ 500F. Look for those perfect crispy cheese edges! Once out of the oven, I added some pecorino romano and oregano, just for a little something extra.
10.  Enjoy!

* Parchment paper if needed
* Hand mixer

### Ingredients

* 2 medium apples such as Pink Lady, Fuji, SugarBee, or Gala
* ½ cup unsalted butter room temperature
* T cup granulated sugar
* 3 eggs
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons whole milk
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1½ cups cake flour or use all-purpose flour
* 2-3 tablespoons turbinado sugar

### Instructions

#### Preheat oven to 350ºF.

#### Prepare the baking dish:

* If using, line the dish with parchment paper and grease the sides of the dish. If not using parchment paper, grease the entire baking dish and set aside.

#### Prepare the apples:

* Core the apples and quarter them. Place each quarter, cut side down, on the cutting board. Slice each quarter into 1/8'' slices. Keep each sliced apple quarter intact so you can easily place them right on top of the cake when ready (refer to the photo).

#### Prepare the cake batter:

* Place the butter in a mixing bowl and use a hand mixer to mix for 1 minute until fluffy. Add the sugar and mix for 23 minutes until fully incorporated.
* Add the eggs one at a time and mix after each addition until fully incorporated.
* Add the vanilla extract, lemon juice, salt, and baking powder and mix again. Add the milk and mix once more until incorporated. It's okay if the mixture appears to be lumpy or curdled.
* Add the cake flour and mix until just incorporated. Do not overmix the batter!

#### Bake the apple cake:

* Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and smooth it out with a rubber spatula. Carefully pick up each sliced apple quarter (keeping the quarters intact as seen in the photo) and place all the sliced apple quarters cut-side down on top of the cake.
* Scatter the turbinado sugar on top of the cake.
* Transfer to the oven and bake for 45 minutes or until a toothpick pierced into the center of the cake comes out clean.

#### Broil (or torch) the turbinado sugar:

* Turn on the broiler. Broil the cake for 13 minutes, being careful not to burn the top, until the sugars begin to melt. Remove from the oven. Alternatively, use a blowtorch to melt the sugars.

#### To serve:

* Let the cake cool and then slice and serve with whipped cream or whipped crème fraîche. Enjoy!

## Equipment

* 2 Large pots
* Colander or sieve

## Ingredients

* 4 ounces diced pancetta
* 1½ pounds boneless short ribs
* 1 pound loose hot Italian sausage
* 1 pound ground beef
* 2 teaspoons neutral oil if needed
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 2 carrots peeled and small-diced
* 2 ribs celery trimmed and small-diced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 cup dry red wine
* 2 28- ounce can whole-peeled tomatoes
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 teaspoon sugar optional
* 24 ounces pasta such as paccheri, rigatoni, or pappardelle
* Salt pepper and crushed red pepper to taste

## For serving:

* Grated parmesan cheese
* Freshly minced parsley

## Instructions

## Cook the pancetta:

* Place the diced pancetta in a large pot. Turn the heat to medium. Stir occasionally for 45 minutes until the fat renders and the pancetta browns. Remove from the pot and transfer to a large bowl.

## Brown the short ribs:

* Pat the short ribs dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Place the short ribs in the pancetta fat and cook over medium-high heat for 35 minutes per side until browned all over. Transfer to the bowl with the pancetta.
* Add the sausage and beef and cook, breaking up with a spoon, until browned, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the bowl of pancetta and short ribs.

## Cook the aromatics:

* If needed, add another teaspoon or two of oil and turn the heat to medium-high.
* Add the onion, celery, and carrots and cook for 57 minutes. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper.

## Brown the tomato paste:

* Melt the butter into the onions. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds. Add the tomato paste and cook, mashing it into the aromatics, for 2 minutes until it begins to deepen in color. Be careful not to burn the garlic.
* Pour in the red wine and turn the heat to high. Whisk the wine into the paste and continue until the wine begins to boil. Boil for 5 minutes until it just begins to reduce.

## Simmer the ragù:

* Add the tomatoes and bring to a boil. Stir in all of the meat from the bowl. Season the sauce with salt, pepper, sugar, and crushed red pepper. Add the bay leaves.
* Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 34 hours or until the short ribs can be shredded easily with a fork.

## Shred the short ribs:

* Remove the ragu from the heat and carefully remove the lid. Shred the beef and mash any remaining whole-peeled tomatoes. Turn the heat to medium-high and let the ragu low-boil uncovered, for 1520 minutes. If the liquid evaporates too quickly, add beef stock in ¼ cup increments. Taste and season the sauce.

## Cook the pasta:

* Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the pasta.

## Coat the pasta:

* Return the heat on the ragu to medium. Once bubbly, add the pasta cooking water along with the cooked pasta. Toss to coat for 1-2 minutes. Taste and season once more to your preferences.

## To serve:

* Divide the pasta between bowls and garnish with parsley and grated parmesan cheese.

2022-01-01,1,"Grilled chicken thigh, chicharrones and corn tacos","gourmandiario","**Ingredients**

For the chicken

* 3 Chicken thighs (with skin)
* 150g of natural yoghurt
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1tsp of ground paprika
* 1tsp of turmeric powder
* Salt

For the corn cobs

* 1 or 2 Precooked corn cobs
* Butter
* Salt

For the mojo

* Couple dried peppers
* Couple Garlic cloves
* 1/2 Onion
* 1 Carrot
* 1tsp of ground cinamon
* 1tsp of powdered hot paprika
* 1tsp of oregano
* 2 tbsp of tomato paste
* 1 bouillon cube of choice (i use chicken)
* Oil (preferably sunflower)

For the tortillas:

* Either use store-bought (weath, corn or mix), or do a simple dough of 3 parts weath flour, 1 part warm water, 1/3 parts of oil, 1tsp of baking powder and a pinch of salt.

**Directions**

1. Start by deboning the chicken thighs and pulling the skin. Save it for the chicharrones later.
2. Prepare the chicken marinade mixing together the yoghurt, minced garlic clove, paprika, turmeric and salt, and add it to a bowl with the meat. Mix well so all of the chicken is coated in the mixture, and leave it in the fridge for at least 12 hours.
3. When the 12 hours have passed, you'll want to prepare the corn cobs to cook them together. Cover them in butter and salt and you're good to go.
4. Grill the marinated chicken and the corn until they start to slightly burn on their sides. You are looking for some exterior crispness and interior juicyness.
5. Grill the shicken skins until they turn golden, and immediately put them on paper towels to drain excess fat. Let them rest so they can get crispy.
6. For the mojo, put all the ingredients in a pot and cook them until vegetables are tender. You can add some water to help. Then blend them together with somoe oil until you have a slightly emulsified mixture. You can pass it through a sieve for a better finish, and add some sugar to taste.
7. Roughly chop the grilled chicken, and cut the corn cobs so that you keep some kernells together per piece.
8. Plating is pretty straightforward, but i love to add cilantro and lime juice.

These are cake donuts because they are not made with yeast! They are fluffy and cakey. We love to eat them with a little powdered sugar!

I made an instructional recipe video if you are interested or if you are more of a visual kind to understand ;) [Old-Fashioned Donut](https://youtu.be/pk8GpIf6Dqk)

1. *Whisk the eggs and the sugar together until they are super fluffy and light (you can do this step with a hand mixer)*
2. Add the melted butter and vanilla
3. Mix  the flour(480g) and baking powder together
4. Put a third of your flour into the egg mixture
5. Mix until its almost fully incorporated
6. Add half of the milk
7. Then add another third of the flour
8. Add the leftover milk
9. Finish with the flour
10. When you have finished mixing, the dough should still, be sticky but it should still come together ( you dont want it runny)
11. At this point, you can add flour until you are satisfied with the texture
12. Wrap it up and refrigerate at least 30minutes

Step 2- Cutting the Donuts

1. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and you should see that it is not so sticky anymore
2. Roll it out on the counter
3. Use a cookie cutter to cut circles out of the dough
4. Use a very small cookie cutter ( we use the cap of a small bottle) to cut out the donut hole
5. You can reroll the extra dough
6. Place all the donuts on a baking tray and all the holes in a bowl for later

Step 3 - Frying

1. Put the shortening in a saucepan
2. Heat it until it reaches 350°F
3. Then put a couple of donuts in it to fry
4. After about 40seconds it should be golden enough to flip them on the other side
5. Wait another 30-40seconds and take them out
6. Place them on a cooling rack with paper towels under it so the shortening drips off
7. Do the same with all the other donuts!
8. Wait for them to cool down ( or dont ;) ) and enjoy!
9. You can freeze them if you dont want to eat them right away!",2271

For some reason, a few years ago, I suddenly felt the need to try and come up with a gluten free cookie recipe that also came out well with vegan substitutes for the egg and butter (unfortunately, I lost the recipe for five years and can't remember the exact vegan version - I *think* I substituted banana for the butter and ground flax + water for egg?).

It took a lot of trial and error, but this is the result. I've gotten a lot of positive feedback on the cookies, but I would love to know what people I *don't* know think about them.

Hopefully my instructions make sense and are easy to follow. If y'all have any suggestions for changes to make it more clear, please let me know!

4. Pat dry the eggplant slices and bread each one of them: from flour, to egg, to breadcrumbs. 

5. Fry each slice in vegetable oil, the temperature should be around 175-180C.

6. Assemble the dish: first some sauce, then the eggplants, then dill, then Parmesan and mozzarella cheese. Do as many layers as you can fit in your casserole dish.

**Ingredients:**

**Tortillas:**

- 200g nixtamalized corn flour

- 1 tsp salt

- 300ml warm water

**Jackfruit:**

- 1 can (560g) canned green jackfruit, drained, cut into smaller pieces

- 1 tsp smoked paprika

- 1 tsp cumin, ground 

- 1/2 tsp salt

- 2 tbsp vegetable oil

- 1 large white onion, diced

- 3 garlic cloves, minced

- 1 can (400g) canned, chopped tomatoes

- 400ml veggie stock

- 1 tsp sugar

**Garnish:**

- Avocado

- Pickled red onions

- Cilantro

- Lime juice

- Hot sauce

**Preparation:**

1. For the tortillas: mix flour with salt, then add the water and combine well. Rest for at least 30 minutes. Divide into balls of around 40-50g. 

2. Put each ball between 2 sheets of plastic wrap (or just use a ziplock cut into 2 pieces like I did), and press them in a tortilla press (which I didnt have) or just use a rolling pin. They should be very thin.

3. Heat up a skillet until very hot and cook the tortillas for around a minute on each side. Keep them wrapped in a towel until ready to use so they keep warm and dont dry out. 

4. For the jackfruit: start by sautéing the white onion with some vegetable oil. After 3-4 minutes add the garlic. After a minute - add the paprika, cumin and salt. Cook for another 30 seconds, then add the jackfruit, tomatoes and stock along with some sugar.

5. Simmer for 15 minutes, then smash the jackfruit with a potato masher. Cook for another 15 minutes until the liquid reduces and you get a pulled pork consistency. 

6. Garnish with avocado slices, pickled red onion, cilantro lime juice, and optionally some hot sauce. I just blended a can of chipotles in adobo until smooth. 

Didnt want to include this in the recipe per se, but for a quick pickled onion - just slice an onion, add the juice of half a lime, some salt and sugar, mix well and let sit for 30 minutes or so. 

You could surely use store bought tortillas - havent found any that I like where I live, so I just prefer to make my own.

Edit: As we are being snarky though. Have some counter evidence https://taaleidoscoop.nl/blog/oliebol-vs-krentenbol/ 

&gt; Je kunt de term krentenbol ook tegenkomen als manier om een oliebol met krenten of rozijnen te onderscheiden van een gewone oliebol. Toch zullen veel mensen zon oliebol-met-krenten gewoon een oliebol noemen.

And here  https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliebol. 

&gt; Oliebollen zijn vaak gevuld, meestal met krenten of rozijnen. 

At the very least it establishes that what you call ""krentenbollen"" are also oliebollen so saying the original person shouldn't have called these oliebollen as they aren't is also silly. 

Equally silly I suppose as the time I have spend arguing silly semantics on the internet now. So I'll leave it at a ""fijne jaarwisseling en gelukkig nieuwjaar"".",1062

**Directions:**

1. Cut the oyster mushrooms into sticks (similar to the size of French fries).

**INGREDIENTS**

* 2-½ lbs beef chuck shoulder, cut into 1 cubes
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* ¼ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
* 6 oz bacon, cut into 1"" squares (1-½ c)
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1-½ c carrots, cut into 1"" pieces
* 1-½ c yellow onions or shallots, roughly chopped
* 2 c dry red wine like Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot
* 2 tablespoon flour
* 2 c beef stock or bouillon
* 2 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme or a couple fresh sprigs
* 2 bay leaves (remove before serving)
* 10 pearl onions (optional, but nice addition)

***Mushrooms***

* 10 oz cremini (button) mushrooms, quartered or halved, depending on size
* 2 tablespoon butter (or more as necessary)
* 2 tablespoon garlic, minced
* Olive oil as needed
* Salt and pepper to taste

***Additional Ingredients***

* 4 tablespoon flat leaf Italian parsley, chopped
* 1 lb egg noodles

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat.
2. Add the bacon (it should sizzle). Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.   
 Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
3. Add beef cubes (make sure they sizzle when touching the oil) and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Make sure not to overcrowd the pan. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
4. Add carrots and onion (or shallots) and stir for about 3 minutes. Season with ½ teaspoon kosher salt and ¼ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper.
5. Add the cooked bacon and browned beef cubes, add 2 tablespoon flour, give it a really good stir, and cook for 2 minutes.
6. Add 2 cups red wine, 2 cups beef stock, 2 tablespoon tomato paste, thyme, bay leaves, and pearl onions. Bring to a boil.
7. Stir and reduce to a simmer. Now, its time to put the lid on.
8. Stir every 15 minutes or so to make sure youve got a good simmer going and nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan.
9. After about 1-½ hours, it should be ready, or close to it. Now is a good time to taste. Dont sweat it if it still seems a little strong on the wine taste. Itll mellow. But make sure it doesnt need any more kosher salt.
10. Now that the beef bourguignon is almost ready, were going to sauté the mushrooms. In a large frying pan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoon butter until it slightly bubbles and foams.
11. Add minced garlic for just 30 seconds (you want them fragrant but not burned) and add the mushrooms.
12. Stir, add a little olive oil (or more butter) if you think the mushrooms are too dry. Season with a pinch of kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes.
13. Add the sautéed mushroom-garlic-butter mixture to the Dutch oven and give it one more last stir.
14. Serve over your favorite side dish. In my case, thats buttered extra-wide egg noodles.
15. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and pour everyone a nice glass of red wine.",3053

FOR THE NOODLES:
3 blocks instant ramen noodles (about 9 ounces), flavor packets discarded

2 tablespoons sesame oil

2 tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed or vegetable

2 tablespoons soy sauce

1 14-ounce package extra-firm tofu, patted dry and cut into ¼-inch thick slices

3 baby bok choy, trimmed and sliced vertically into 4 pieces

Handful of cilantro leaves

FOR THE MARINADE:

2 tablespoons hoisin

1 tablespoon sesame oil

1 tablespoon maple syrup

1 garlic clove, grated

1 teaspoon sesame seeds

Step 1
Heat the oven to 450 degrees and place one rack on the top and one on the bottom. Fill a kettle or medium pot with water (about 8 cups) and bring to a boil. Place the noodles in a heat-proof bowl and cover with boiling water. Soak for 5 minutes, then drain. Set aside the bowl to use in Step 5.

Step 2
Make the marinade: In a medium bowl, whisk to combine the hoisin sauce, sesame oil, maple syrup, garlic and sesame seeds.

Step 3
Place the noodles on a sheet pan. Add the sesame oil, 1 tablespoon of neutral oil, soy sauce, and ½ teaspoon of kosher salt. Toss to combine, then spread the noodles out evenly.

Step 4
Dip each tofu slice into the marinade, coating both sides, then add them to the sheet pan, pushing the noodles aside so that the tofu touches the pan and doesnt just sit on top of the noodles. Place on the bottom rack of the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Reserve excess marinade.

Step 5
Place the baby bok choy into the reserved bowl, then add the remaining 1 tablespoon of neutral oil and ½ teaspoon of kosher salt, and toss to coat.

Step 6
Remove the sheet pan from the oven (the noodles should be crisp on the bottom and around the edges) and add the bok choy to the pan. Return the sheet pan to the top rack of the oven and bake for 4 to 7 minutes until the greens are vibrant with crispy edges, and the top of the noodles are crispy. Drizzle with the remaining marinade, top with cilantro leaves and serve.",1962
2021-12-21,12,"Bubbie's chicken soup (aka Jewish penicillin)","BrinaElka","Everyone has their own way to make chicken soup, so here's mine (from my Bubbie) 

Ingredients: 

"" Chicken pieces (bones, a picked over rotisserie, wings... dark meat is more flavorful)

"" 1 large onion, peeled and cut in half

"" 2-4 carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks

"" 2-3 ribs celery, with leaves, cut into chunks

"" 2-3 parsnips, peeled and cut into chunks 

"" salt and pepper

Instructions:


1. Throw everything into the biggest soup pot you've got and fill with cold water. (If you've got a soup sock or cheesecloth, put everything in there and then into the pot. It makes straining easier at the end). 



2. Bring to a boil and skim skim skim. Just keep skimming off all the foam and junk. Eventually, it'll boil clear. 



3. Set to a simmer and let it cook down. Way down. More. More. Nope, more. That's why you used a HUGE pot, so you can cook it way down. Taste and salt as needed. 



4. Remove the soup sock, or pour everything into a strainer over another medium soup pot. 



5. Pick out chicken meat if applicable, and a few carrot chunks to serve. 

(If you're going to make matzah balls, use the box mix. Don't boil them in the soup, as they'll absorb all your delicious broth.) 


Serve hot, and celebrate your inner Jewish grandmother.

ETA: if it's really fatty, you can chill it overnight and skim off some of the fat before reheating to serve.

Updated about seasoning: I find that dill is very overwhelming in the seasoning, so all we add is salt and pepper as needed. Cooked down enough, mine has a rich flavor due to the chicken bones. Again, everyone has their own version, so add whatever herbs you like!",1643

* 1 c brown sugar, packed
* ¼ c honey
* 1 tablespoon brown mustard
* ½ c pineapple juice
* ¼ c apple juice
* ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon ground cloves  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

* Preheat oven to 325°F.
* Unwrap the ham and place it in a large baking dish. I also decided to pour all the juices from the bag in the dish, to help keep it juicy.
* If you have a spiral-cut ham, theres nothing else to do. Otherwise, make ¼3 deep cuts in a diamond pattern all over the ham surface (this will allow the juices from the brown sugar ham glaze to drip down inside later).
* Place in the oven and bake (a ham will take about 1 to 1-½ hours to cook through). After 1 hour, check the temperature by inserting a meat thermometer in the thickest part (being careful not to touch the bone). The ham is ready when the internal temperature has reached 130°F.
* At about the 1-hour mark, start making the brown sugar ham glaze.
* Melt butter in a small pan over medium heat. 
* Once the butter has melted, add all the other ingredients and whisk together.
* Bring to a simmer, whisking occasionally, and cook for about 5 minutes. 
* Immediately remove from heat and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes.
* Check the internal temperature of your ham (the ham is finished cooking when it has reached 130°F).
* When its getting close to that point, but has about a half hour left, baste half of the brown sugar ham glaze onto the ham. 
* Fifteen minutes later, brush on the remaining ham glaze and let the ham finish cooking until it has reached 130°F.

I decided to make this spiral-shaped beauty, filled with spinach and soft brine cheese. Moreover, I reached out to our Greek friends and used their ultra thin Filo / Phyllo dough sheets, in order to get a super crisp Kol Borek (Turkish, which translates to ""arm borek/pastry"").

**Enjoy the recipe and the latest episode of United Cuisines on Youtube!**

INGREDIENTS

* Filo / Phyllo dough sheets \[10 oz / 300 g\]
* spinach \[1 lb / 450 g\]
* Turkish ""white cheese"" or Greek Feta \[7 oz / 200 g\]
* vegetable oil \[1/3 cup / 80 g\]
* clarified butter \[3 oz / 90 g\]
* 1 medium-sized onion
* Aleppo chili flakes \[1 tsp\]
* salt &amp; pepper to taste
* sesame &amp; nigella seeds

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Wash and roughly cut the spinach, peel and chop the onion into small cubes
2. Sauté spinach in a pan over medium-low heat with a tablespoon of olive oil. Add the first batch of spinach, which will wilt and considerably shrink in size quickly. Using a kitchen tong, turn it upside down, let wilt, add another batch, and repeat till all the spinach is in the pan. Cook for 3 minutes, mixing and turning multiple times. Transfer into a bowl and let cool down
3. In the same pan, sauté the onion with some olive oil over medium heat for 3-5 minutes, till translucent
4. Grab the spinach, squeeze the water out of it and transfer the greens into the pan. Combine spinach and onion, season with salt &amp; pepper to taste and mix in a teaspoon of Aleppo peppers
5. Transfer into the bowl of earlier, let cool down, crumble the white cheese/Feta over it and combine well
6. In parallel, put the vegetable oil and clarified butter into a small saucepan  and place it over low heat. Let heat up till the butter is fully melted and set aside
7. Grease a round oven-safe dish - preferably metal - with the butter-oil mix
8. Grab one ultra-thin dough/filo sheet and paint it with the butter-oil, before placing a second sheet on top and greasing it as well
9. Spread a generous amount of the spinach-cheese filling along the long side of the rectangle. Grab the sheet at the same end where the filling is and start rolling - not too loose, nor too tight. Place it along the rim of the greased oven pan, follow up with the next rolls and spiral inwards till the pan is fully covered
10. Brush with some more of the butter-oil mix, sprinkle with sesame and nigella seeds and bake at 180°C/360°F on the lower third of your conventional oven for around 45 minutes till golden and crisp. Monitor the process, as baking/browning can vary strongly depending on your oven

***Cookie Dough***

* 240 grams all-purpose flour
* 4 grams baking soda
* 3 grams kosher salt
* 200 grams rolled oats
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
* ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom
* ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
* 226 grams unsalted butter, room temperature (2 sticks)
* 200 grams light brown sugar
* 150 grams white sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 tablespoon good quality vanilla
* 135 grams pecan pieces
* 100 grams white chocolate chips

***Brandy soaked cranberries***

* 1 tablespoon orange zest
* 1 cup dried cranberries
* ¼ cup cognac or brandy

***Icing***

* 200 grams confectioners' sugar
* 3 tablespoons whole milk
* 1 teaspoon good quality vanilla

# Instructions

1. In a medium container with a tight fitting lid combine orange zest, cranberries, and cognac - stir together. Allow mixture to sit on the counter overnight (up to 12 hours).
2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and cover several full size baking sheets with parchment paper.
3. In a medium-sized bowl mix together flour, baking soda, kosher salt, oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and ginger - set aside.
4. In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment (or a large bowl if that's unavailable), add room temperature butter and both sugars - mix together until smooth and fluffy. Next, mix in the egg and vanilla until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and gently fold in all of the dry ingredients. The mixture will seem dry, but don't worry - the dough will hydrate during resting time.
5. Divide the cookie dough into roughly 1.5 ounce segments using a spoon or medium cookie scoop (you can weigh them if you want but it's not necessary), roll each segment into a ball, and place the balls onto a prepared cookie sheet. Bake cookies for about 14 - 16 minutes. Finished cookies will have light brown edges with a slightly soft center. Cool directly on baking sheet.
6. In a shallow wide dish (I used a shallow cake pan) mix confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla. Mix until icing is thick. To decorate, either gently dip the tops of the cookies into the icing or use a spoon to drizzle the icing on top of the cookies. Frosting will set in about an hour. Store in an airtight container. Cookies are best eaten within 5 days.

* 15 g almond petals
* chocolate
 
**Directions**
  
1. Beat the cold whites with a pinch of salt until they stop falling off. Nuts are ground in a blender, but not to crumbs. Mix nuts with flour and sweetener. We combine the proteins with the dry mass, very carefully mixing the flour in one direction so that the proteins do not fall off.
 
2. We draw 4 equal circles on baking paper (I have 12 cm) and spread our mass evenly. We send it to a preheated 180 ° oven for 20 minutes.
 
3. For the cream, mix soft cottage cheese with honey. Soak the gelatin in water for 20 minutes. Then put it in a water bath until completely dissolved. After that, gelatin can be added to the curd.
 
4. We smear our cakes with the curd mass, then apply the cream on top and on the sides. Sprinkle with almond petals. We draw a chocolate cobweb. First we apply spirals with chocolate, then we draw straight lines from the center to make a spider web.
 
5. We send our cake to the refrigerator for impregnation.",1233

2021-12-09,19,"Medovik | Honey Cake","Sweet_SerGio","***Ingredients:***

***Honey cake layers:***

* Eggs - 3(150g)
* Salt - 3g
* Granulated sugar - 180g
* Honey - 150
* All-purpose flour - 600g
* Baking soda - 12g
* Unsalted butter - 90g

***Sour cream frosting:***

* Heavy cream 33% - 400
* Vanilla extract
* Powdered sugar - 200g
* Sour cream 30% - 800
* Lemon juice\\zest

***Honeycomb decoration:***

* White chocolate - 150g
* Yellow food colouring
* Honey

***Preparation:***

1. Line a strainer or a small colander with cheesecloth. Set this contraption over a deep container or bowl (so that the whey can strain out the bottom without touching the strainer). Put the sour cream into the strainer and cover tightly with plastic wrap or a plastic bag and put it in the refrigerator until it has a thick texture and some amount of whey liquid has been released(at least 24 hours but up to 2 days).
2. Add granulated sugar, honey, unsalted butter, eggs, salt and baking soda to a medium saucepan and melt them together over medium/low heat, whisking occasionally until sugar is completely dissolved. Dont put them over high heat to prevent boiling.
3. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a standing mixer with the paddle attachment. Then add sifted all-purpose flour and start mixing for a few minutes on a medium speed until the dough reaches a clay consistency and doesnt stick to the bowl.
4. Cut the dough into 15 equal pieces(77g each) and let it chill for a few hours or overnight in the fridge.
5. Take your dough out of the fridge and let it warm up a little bit. On a well-floured surface, roll each piece out into a thin 22cm circle. You can sprinkle the top with a little flour too to keep dough from sticking to your rolling pin.
6. Using a cake ring(you can use a lid from a saucepan) cut each dough circle to make a perfect shape. Keep the scraps for later! Place each dough circle on a parchment paper and pierce with a fork all over the surface to prevent air bubbles. Bake in the oven at 200C(392F) for 6-7 minutes until golden brown. Let them cool completely.
7. Finally, bake the scraps separated evenly on a re-used sheet of parchment. Once the scraps are baked, cooled and firm, you can crush them with a rolling pin or pulse them in a food processor until you have fine crumbs.
8. Beat heavy cream with powdered sugar until fluffy and stiff peaks form (1-2 min on high speed). Add strained sour cream and mix gently. You can also add vanilla extract, lemon zest or juice to your taste.
9. Place the first cake onto a turntable and top it with 6-8 tablespoons of frosting; spread it gently and equally until its surface is completely covered. Place the next cake over the frosting layer without pressing it down. Repeat the process until all the layers have been stacked and topped with the sour cream frosting. Frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting.
10. Dust the top and sides with your cakecrumbs, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. This cake needs time to absorb some of the cream and soften, so be patient. Its worth the wait!
11. Place finely chopped chocolate in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 15 seconds; remove the bowl from the microwave and stir. ... - Repeat the process until most of the chocolate has melted and is smooth. At this point add yellow food coloring and mix everything thoroughly.
12. Place the bubble wrap bubble-side up on a flat surface. Pour the chocolate on top of the bubble wrap. Spread it fairly thick: you don't want to see the shape of the bubbles beneath. Let it chill out in the fridge. Gently peel off the bubble wrap. Cut it with a cake ring 2-3cm smaller than the actual cake.
13. Place chocolate honeycomb on top of the cake. Using a star nozzle, pipe swirls of frosting around the top of the cake. You can also fill hexagonal cells with honey.

2.Sift dry ingredients together. Place sugar, eggs and salt into a mixer bowl and whisk until light and fluffy. Add dry ingredients(in 2 batches) into the batter and mix on a low speed. Add milk and melted butter and continue mixing. At the end add boiling water and mix until well combined.

3.Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and put it in the oven and bake for 40min until done. Insert a toothpick into the center of the cake if it comes out clean, it is done.

2021-12-04,27,"Orange-Maple Roast Duck","BushyEyes","**Recipe here originally: [Orange-Maple Roasted Duck](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/orange-maple-roast-duck-recipe/)**

This orange-maple roast duck recipe may be time-consuming but it's so unbelievably easy to prepare and tastes incredible.

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 3 hours 30 minutes 

Servings: 4 people

### Equipment

* Sheet pan
* Roasting rack
* Small pot

### Ingredients

* 5-6 pound whole pekin duck; giblets and neck removed 
* Salt pepper
* 8 clementines divided
* 3-4 shallots
* 4 star anise pods
* ½ cup maple syrup
* 1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard
* 1 teaspoon dijon mustard

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Duck:

* Preheat oven to 350ºF.
* Pat the duck dry and use a sharp knife to create angled slits along the breast. Cut into the fatty parts around where the legs meet the body and between the wings and the body. You just want to make enough slits around the fatty part of the duck skin so that the fat renders out.

#### Stuff the Duck:

* Peel the shallots and quarter. Quarter 4 of the clementines. Stuff the duck with the clementines and shallots and tie the legs together. Season the duck liberally with salt and pepper.

#### Roast the Duck:

* Line a baking sheet with foil and place a raised roasting rack on the foil. Place the duck on top and transfer to the oven, breast-side up, for 1 hour.
* Flip the duck and cook, breast-side down, for 1 more hour.
* Remove the duck from the oven. At this point, you can drain off the duck fat and reserve it for another use.
* Roast the duck, breast-side up for 40 minutes more.

#### Prepare the Glaze:

* In a saucepan, combine the juice of the remaining 4 clementines, maple syrup, 4 star anise pods, and 1 teaspoon dijon mustard. Bring to a boil and whisk until smooth. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat.
* Remove the duck from the oven and brush half the glaze over the duck. Return to the oven for 20 more minutes.
* Brush the duck with the remaining glaze and bake for 10 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil for 4-5 minutes until the skin darkens on top, being careful not to burn the sugars in the glaze.
* *Note: You can reserve a few teaspoons of the sauce and spoon it over the duck at service.*

#### To Serve:

* Remove from oven and serve! Enjoy!",2275

2021-12-04,2,"Bibimbap","kaydunlap","Vegan Beef Bibimbap - This makes 4-6 servings.

Ingredients: 

- 1 XL or 2 Medium Zucchini
- 2 Large Carrots
- 1 bunch Green Onion
- 16 oz Mushroom
- 2 Tbsp Garlic
- 2 Tbsp Ginger
- 3 Tbsp Mirin (or vinegar)
- 1 lb protein of choice (ground beef, bison, turkey, vegan mince)
- salt &amp; pepper
- high heat oil, like canola oil
- Cooked white rice

For the Sauce:

- 4 Tbsp Soy Sauce
- 2 Tbsp Sesame Oil
- 2 Tbsp Sweet Soy Sauce (or sub additional 2 Tbsp soy sauce + 2 Tbsp sugar)
- 1 Tbsp+ Sriracha (or gochujang, sambal oelek, spicy sauce of choice)

Instructions:

For the sauce:

- Combine the soy sauce, sweet soy sauce, sesame oil, sriracha, and some fresh ground black pepper. You can omit the sriracha at this step if you prefer, and just put it on at the end to your taste. Set aside until later.

For the pickled green onion:

- Separate the green onion into greens + whites. Chop the green tops into roughly 1 inch segments and set aside. Finely slice the white bottoms and place them into 3 Tbsp Mirin (or vinegar) with a pinch of salt and set aside until later.

[Prep](https://i.imgur.com/Gppoq3L.jpg):

- Using a veggie peeler, peel the carrots into ribbons. I don't mind having a variety of sizes, but keep in mind that smaller pieces tend to catch more easily and burn if you aren't careful.
- Slice your zucchini into 1/4-1/2 in discs, then cut in half to make half moons.
- Slice the mushrooms (or buy them pre-sliced) :)
- Mince the garlic &amp; ginger (or buy it pre-minced, because you hate mincing them) :)

[Cook](https://i.imgur.com/QEaBFu8.jpg):

- Preheat a wok (or other large pan) over Med-High heat with a small amount of high heat oil and cook your mushrooms until they release all their water, and then cook that off. I rinse my mushrooms, but you can add a small splash of water to your wok if it's too dry. They will release a ton of liquid, so be patient. Once the water has cooked off, season with salt &amp; pepper, add a splash of oil, and saute until browned and some of the mushrooms are crispy. Set the mushrooms aside.

- Add another splash of oil (if needed), and cook the zucchini until it starts to soften and brown, season with salt &amp; pepper, then set aside. I prefer to do this in batches. Otherwise some may burn, while others don't get any color before they turn to mush.

- Reduce heat to Medium. Add another splash of oil (if needed). Cook the carrots until they soften slightly and get some color, season with salt &amp; pepper, then set aside. Stay on top of these, because they burn easily, especially smaller ribbons.

- Brown your protein of choice. We went with Beyond Beef this time, but we've also made this with Impossible burger, ground beef, ground bison, chopped steak, and even omitted it entirely. Once your protein is browned (and drained if relevant), season with salt &amp; pepper, add 1-2 Tbsp of your prepared sauce, and stir to combine. Then push the protein to the sides, add a small amount of oil if the pan is dry, and cook the garlic &amp; ginger until fragrant (30-60 sec). Mix it in and then add the chopped green tops of the green onion, stir to combine, and cook another 30 seconds until just starting to wilt.

- Serve over white rice. Add some of the zucchini, carrot, mushroom, and protein. Top with the pickled green onion, sesame seeds, 1-2 Tbsp sauce, and Sriracha to taste.",3363

* icing sugar

**Method:**

1. Crush the cardamom pods in a pestle and mortar to remove the seeds. Discard the outer shell. Grind the spice up to a fine dust. If you can only find pre-ground cardamom then use about one tsp. of it in this recipe. Peel the apples and slice them up into small chunks between ½ and ¼ of an inch big. Heat some butter in a pan on medium high heat until it just begins to toast and brown slightly and add the apples. After about two minutes add the cardamom followed by the cinnamon and brown sugar. Grate a bit of fresh nutmeg over the mixture and stir it around. You do not want to overcook your apples, just take the edge off that raw bite. Turn the heat off and set them aside to cool.     
2.  Sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl and add the sugar and salt. When the apple mixture has cooled add it in along with the beaten egg, melted butter and sparkling apple cider. Stir the batter well to combine. If the mix is too wet, add a touch more flour. If its too dry add a small bit of cider.
3. Heat a few inches of vegetable or canola oil in a pan. Test a small dollop of batter. If it sizzles and cooks straight away the oil is hot enough. Scoop the batter up with a large tbsp.and use another one to drop it gently into the oil. Irregular shapes and edges are part of the fun. Do 4  5 fritters at a time and make sure the oil doesnt cool too much, this can cause sogginess and oiliness. Cook for a few minutes until golden brown before turning and doing the same on the other side. Take them out of the oil and allow the excess to drip off on a wire rack or soak on some kitchen paper.
4. You can serve your fritters simply dusted with sugar or cinnamon, or both, while a simple glaze can be made by sifting icing sugar and mixing with a drop of the cider. Aim for a pourable viscosity and drizzle it over the top or dunk the fritters in for an even coating. If opting for the glaze, allow the fritters to cool for a few minutes first.",2671

RECIPE:

INGREDIENTS: 

* 1 can (15 oz) Pumpkin Purée
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 4 eggs (1 egg used for egg wash)
* 1 and 1/2 tablespoons pumpkin spice
* 1 tablespoon corn flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

&amp;#x200B;

DIRECTIONS: 

* Thaw the pie crust for a while, so it gets easy to roll out. You don't want the crust to get too soft either
* Dust enough flour on the board and roll the crust out to 1/8th inch thick and 1 inch wider than your pie dish.
* Once you rolled it out, transfer the dough to the pie dish and instead of pressing down the dough, gently push down the edges to shape it properly.
* Trim off the excess and then tug the edges to form a thicker edge of the pie. Then shape the edge as per your liking.
* Place the pie dish in the fridge for 15 minutes before you blind bake.
* The trimmed off dough, can be rolled out and cut out to autumn leaves shape using cookie cutter (link given in notes below) or anything else of your choice. These will be baked separately and added on top of the pie to decorate the baked pie.
* Layer the cut-out autumn leaves and place it in a cookies sheet. Place it in the freezer to be used later.
* Preheat the oven to 400 F to blind bake the pie crust.
* Crush a parchment paper and place it on top of the pie crust. Then top it with dried beans or lentils. Level it out so it's evenly spread out.
* Bake for 10 minutes.
* Then remove the parchment paper and bake for 5 more minutes.
* While the pie crust cools off a little, prepare the filling.
* Also preheat the oven to 350 F
* In a mixing bowl, add the pumpkin purée along with sugar, 3 eggs, heavy cream, pumpkin spice, corn flour, and salt. Give a whisk until it looks smooth without any crumbs.
* Pour the filling to the partially baked pie crust.
* Crack the extra egg and use it to rub on the edges of the pie crust.
* Bake for 40 minutes, might need more time if you are using a 9-inch pie dish. After halfway through, start keeping an eye. Once the side gets firm, but the center is a little wobbly, take it off the oven and let it cool completely before you slice.
* In the meantime, take out the autumn leaves from the freezer and rub egg wash on all of them. Then bake at 400 F for about 15 minutes.
* When you are ready to slice, prepare the pumpkin spiced whipping cream. Just add a little amount of pumpkin spice and sugar and whip the heavy cream.
* Decorate the pie with whipped cream and the autumn leaves.
* To slice the pie, dip the knife in hot water and then whip it clean before slicing. This will ensure a clean slice every time.
* Enjoy the creamy pumpkin pie.",3004

**INGREDIENTS**  
***Crust***

* 10 oz graham crackers or gingersnaps
* 1-½ sticks unsalted butter, melted

***Pumpkin Cheesecake Filling***

* 1 lb Philadelphia cream cheese, softened
* ¾ c granulated sugar
* 16 oz pure pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie mix)
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tablespoon flour
* 1-½ teaspoon cinnamon
* ½ teaspoon ginger
* ½ teaspoon nutmeg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

***Whipped Cream (optional)***

* 1 c heavy cream
* 2 tablespoon granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  


**INSTRUCTIONS**   
***Making the Crust***

* Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers or ginger snaps until they're cookie dust...or very fine crumbs. If you don't have a food processor, you can place the crackers in a ziplok bag and crush them with a rolling pin.
* Place the ""cookie dust"" in a bowl and add melted butter. Mix with a fork until the crumbs stick together well when pressed between your fingers.
* Using your fingers, press the crust into the bottom and up along sides of the springform pan in an even layer.

***Pumpkin Cheesecake Filling***

* Preheat oven to 350°F.
* To soften cream cheese, either leave it sit out on the counter for a little bit until it has reached room temperature, or remove foil wrapper from cream cheese and microwave for about 30 seconds.
* Using a stand mixer or a handheld electric mixer, first mix together cream cheese, eggs, and sugar until well blended.
* Then, add remaining ingredients and mix just until well blended and smooth.
* Pour into crust and spread evenly using a rubber spatula.
* Bake at 350°F for 45 minutes.
* Wearing oven mitts, give the oven rack a good shake. If the outer 2"" have firmed up, but the inside is still a bit wobbly, that's fine. Turn off the oven, but leave the cheesecake in the oven for another hour, while it cools down...then put it in the refrigerator. Cooling the pie in this slow manner helps reduce the chance of cracking.  
* Chill for at least 6 hours. 
* Serve with homemade whipped cream.

***Whipped Cream (optional)***

* Using a stand mixer or a handheld electric mixer, whisk together 1 c heavy cream, 2 tablespoon sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract until firm peaks.  Enjoy!",2365

This recipe is vegan and delicious and the pepper works very well with the sweet and salty aubergine. There is a tempura guide below the recipe with tips and troubleshooting.

If you would like more original recipes of mine please consider following: [https://www.leviathanfood.com/subscribe](https://www.leviathanfood.com/subscribe)

**Ingredients:**

&amp;#x200B;

*Aubergines*

2 aubergines

2 tbsp. mirin

2 tbsp. rice wine vinegar

2 tbsp. sesame oil

1 tbsp. white sugar

2 tbsp. white miso paste

&amp;#x200B;

*tempura &amp; batter*

1 whole pepper

2 heaped tbsp. cake flour

1 heaped tbsp. rice flour

1/4 tsp. baking soda

100ml ice-cold sparkling water

pinch of salt

canola oil for frying

**Method:**

1. Preheat oven to 180° C (355° F). Slice the aubergines lengthways in two and score them  
with a criss-crossed diamond pattern along the white interior section. Heat some oil in a pan  
and place them with this side down and fry for a couple of minutes until they brown and  
caramelise. Turn them over and cook the skin side for another few minutes while you make  
you the glaze. Add more oil if needs be, as the aubergines can soak it up.

  
2. Mix the mirin, miso, sesame oil, sugar and vinegar together to make a paste. Take the  
aubergines out of the pan and lay them on a baking tray, skin side down with the white  
facing up. Smear the paste liberally over each one until it is used up and place the tray in the  
oven to bake for approximately 25 minutes. The glaze will bubble and brown and get some  
nice charred bits, just be mindful that it doesnt burn. Take them out and plate them up,  
ready for the tempura topping.

  
3. Slice the pepper up into thin even strips. Make the tempura batter by sifting the dry  
ingredients into a bowl and gently mixing with the cold sparkling water. Do not over mix it.  
Some lumps are fine. Put your oil on. Dust the pepper in some flour and shake the excess off  
before adding to the batter and frying. 

**Tempura Guide:**

When done correctly, tempura is very light and crisp and keeps the integrity, flavour and  
texture of the vegetables intact. Below are some tips and troubleshooting.  
\- Aim for a frying temperature of between 170°C and 180°C (335°F and 350°F). If you dont  
have a thermometer, you can test to see if the oil is ready by dropping a little bit of the  
batter in. If it bubbles up and starts to sizzle immediately then your oil is hot enough.

  
Tempura that comes out too oily and a bit soft is most likely due to the oil not being hot  
enough. Remember to use a heavy-bottomed pot with tall walls. Adding too much at the  
same time can reduce the temperature of the oil and it can also make the oil boil over the  
side, so be careful and add a few bits at a time. Take the bowl over and dip the pepper in,  
allow the excess to fall off and gently and confidently drop it into the pot.

  
Do not over mix your batter. We use cake flour and rice flour because of the low gluten  
content. This makes for a very light batter. The baking soda and the ice cold carbonated  
water also helps with this. You can use chopsticks to gently mix it. I like to use a large spoon  
to gently turn it and break up some of the lumps. You may need to add an extra drop of  
water to get a consistency that is not overly thick but that can comfortably coat the  
vegetables.

  
Serve the tempura and eat it as soon as possible. It doesnt do too well sitting around for

**Ingredients:**

- 4 lamb shanks, around 400g each, cleaned and with the bone frenched

- 1 tsp garlic powder

- 1 tsp ground cinnamon

- 1 tsp ground cumin

- 1 tsp smoked paprika

- 1 tsp chilli flakes

- 1 tsp salt

- 1 tsp ground pepper

- 1 tsp fresh rosemary, chopped

- 2 tbsp olive oil

- 4 tbsp vegetable oil

- 250ml dry red wine

- 2 large onions, julienned

- 1 large carrot, roughly chopped

- 6 garlic cloves, smashed

- 4 bay leaves

- 500ml chicken stock

**Preparation:**

1. Make the seasoning by combining garlic powder, cinnamon, cumin, paprika, chilli, salt, pepper and rosemary.

2. Rub some olive oil on the shanks, then coat thoroughly with the seasoning. Marinade in the fridge for at least 2-3 hours. The longer, the better (up to 36 hours I would say). 

3. Heat some vegetable oil in a large, oven-safe pot over high heat. As soon as the oil gets very hot (barely starting to smoke), start searing the shanks until browned on all sides. Work in batches if your pot is not big enough.

4. Add the wine, onion, carrot, garlic and bay leaves. Sit the meat on top of the veggies so it doesnt directly touch the pot.

5. Add the stock, bring to a simmer, then transfer to an oven preheated to 160C. Braise for 3 hours or until the meat is really tender - literally falling of the bone.

6. Reserve the shanks, strain the liquid and cook to reduce to your desired thickness.

7. Serve with some sauce poured on top of the shanks, and some extra on the side.

2021-11-16,3,"Vegan &amp; GF Dark Chocolate Tarte","Doryhotcheeto","This chocolate tarte is both Vegan and Gluten Free, but its so good that I dont even want to make it about that. Our family has no food restrictions, and I make it regularly for both special occasions and just because. This chocolatey, decadent, and easy pie comes together in half an hour. Once assembled, you can pop it in the fridge and forget about it overnight. Best served cold, it makes for a great make ahead kind of pie, good for chaotic holiday cooking or to take to a friends. If you are traveling with it, stick it in the freezer and it will freeze solid, making it travel-proof.

**EQUIPMENT :**

* Kitchen Scale
* Sauce pan
* Pie plate (Whatever size is fine. The smaller the plate, the thicker the pie.)\*Mortar &amp; Pestle (Or some other way to crush your hazelnuts)

**INGREDIENTS - TART CRUST :**

* 100g Almond Flour
* 50g Cocoa Powder
* 60g Coconut Oil - Liquid
* 30g Sugar
* Pinch of Salt

**INGREDIENTS - FILLING :**

* 1 Can / 400g of Full Fat Coconut Milk (Mine was 17% Fat )
* 250g Dark Chocolate
* 100g Sugar
* 1tsp Vanilla
* Pinch of Salt
* Toasted Hazelnuts
* Flaky Sea Salt

**TROUBLESHOOTING :**

* I love this pie, but Im always worried that the filling may not set solid. If that happens, then freeze before serving so you can get a clean cut.
* If you want to ensure it sets solid, you want to cook the filling long enough / hot enough. When I use a cast iron dutch oven, it takes more like 25 minutes because it takes 5 minutes to heat up whereas if Im using a light sauce pan, it gets hot very quickly. So make sure it gets to an initial boil before lowering the heat so the filling is bubbling, simmering for at least 20 minutes to ensure it sets solid. You want to see big bubbles erupting on the surface the whole time as opposed to small fast bubbles.

**INSTRUCTIONS :**

* Preheat oven to 170\*C
* Lets do the nuts first. When nuts enter my house, the entire bags contents get toasted before they are used because toasted nuts are empirically better than untoasted nuts. If you have raw hazelnuts, and youre just toasting them for this tarte, I would say maybe 2 handfuls for abut 10 minutes. Keep an eye and nose out for them as they will start to smell delicious when ready. When cooled, crush them up to sprinkle on top later. Set aside.
* Mix all the crust ingredients together. Make sure the coconut oil is in liquid form. Our flat right now is chilly so the coconut oil likes to stay as solid as a bar of soap, so I always have to heat mine up, but it is necessary to ensure the crust sticks to itself and doesnt crumble.
* I line my pie plate with parchment paper and then squish it all in, trying to make an even layer on the bottom. I just use my hands, but a measuring cup or something with a flat bottom might help. If youre using a smaller pie plate, you may have a lot of crust, so go ahead and squish up to the sides as evenly as possible. It probably wont go all the way to the top of the pie plate which is normal.
* Use a fork to dock your crust - poking holes in it.
* Bake for 15 minutes.
* Now for filling! Grab all your ingredients and measure them out.
* Add the coconut milk, chocolate chips, sugar and salt into the sauce pan. Get it to an initial boil and then lower the heat to simmer for 20 minutes over medium heat while the pie is baking. Kind of like making caramel or browning butter, dont go anywhere. Stay put and keep stirring so you dont get lumps at the bottom. At first it will look like chocolate chips sitting in a coconut milk bath, but it will come together into a thick syrup / shiny pudding. Add the vanilla after you kill the heat.
* Take your pie crust out of the oven and kill the heat.
* Pour the filling into the pie crust. It will look like a wet chocolate sauce. Sprinkle on crushed hazelnuts and a pinch of flaky salt. ( I always place the pie plate on a sheet pan before it goeS in the fridge because its very jiggly and wet at this stage, and it is much easier to manoeuvre a cool sheet pan than a piping hot pie plate. I also put down a trivet or something for the sheet pan to rest on in the fridge so the heat isnt sitting directly on the surface. )
* Now this baby needs to go into the fridge to cool, preferably overnight, but for at least 4 hours. Try to be patient because checking it every ten minutes or so like I did will mean it takes that much longer to firm up.",4384

Calories: 246kcal

## Equipment

* Large pot
* Colander
* 12×8 baking dish
* Saucepan

## Ingredients

## Green bean casserole:

* 2 pounds French green beans haricots verts, rinsed
* 2 teaspoons neutral oil
* 8 tablespoons butter divided
* 1 yellow onion peeled and sliced into half-moons
* 12 ounces mushrooms scrubbed and thinly sliced
* 1/3 cup sweet vermouth
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 1/2 cup vegetable stock or water
* 2 cups heavy cream or half-and-half
* 3/4 teaspoon nutmeg more or less to taste depending on your preference
* 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
* Salt to taste
* Butter or cooking spray

## Crispy fried shallots:

* 10 shallots approximately 1 pound; peeled and thinly sliced in rings
* Neutral oil
* Flaky sea salt

## Instructions

## Preheat oven to 375ºF.

## Blanch the green beans:

* Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 2 teaspoons of salt. Add the green beans and cook for 5 minutes until bright green. Drain and transfer to an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Once the green beans have cooled off, drain off the water and set the green beans in a paper towel-lined bowl to soak up any excess water.

## Cook the mushrooms:

* Heat 2 teaspoons of neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, occasionally turning, for 5-7 minutes until it softensseason with salt.
* Melt 4 tablespoons of butter into the onion. Once bubbly and melted, add the mushrooms and cook for 1215 minutes. Allow the mushrooms to release their liquid and for the liquid to evaporate. Once the liquid has evaporated, the mushrooms will take on a deep, golden brown color. Don't rush the mushroom cooking process!
* Pour the sweet vermouth into the pot of mushrooms and bring to a boil. Boil for 56 minutes until it is mostly reducedseason with salt and pepper. Transfer the mushrooms and onions to a bowl. Wipe out the pot.

## Prepare the sauce:

* Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter in the pot. Once bubbly, add the flour and whisk to incorporate it into the butter. Continue stirring until the flour takes on a nutty aroma, about 2 minutes.
* Whisking regularly, pour in the vegetable stock, and continue whisking until a slurry forms. Next, begin adding the heavy cream in half cup increments and whisking after each addition. Continue until all of the cream has been added, and the sauce is thick. Season with salt.
* Simmer for 510 minutes over low heat until the sauce is thickened to your liking. Season it with salt, white pepper, and nutmeg.
* Fold the cooked mushrooms and onions into the sauce and stir to coat. Turn off the heat and set it aside.

## Assemble the casserole:

* Grease a 12×8 baking dish. Arrange the green beans in the baking dish and pour the mushroom sauce over the top and toss to coat the beans with the sauce. If you like, add a sprinkle of flaky sea salt on top.

## Bake the casserole:

* Transfer the casserole to the oven for 2530 minutes or until the green beans are tender and the sauce is bubbly and browned around the edges.

## Start the shallots:

* As the casserole bakes, cook the shallots. Place the shallots in the saucepan and pour in oil to just barely cover them.

## Sizzle the shallots:

* Turn the heat to medium and cook, turning the shallots occasionally, for 68 minutes until they just begin to turn golden brown in places.
* As the shallots continue to deepen in color, continue stirring more frequently, turning them often in the hot oil.
* Continue for an additional 13 minutes or until all the shallots are deep golden brown. The precise timing will depend on the heat on your stovetop, so keep a close eye on the shallots and continue turning them until golden brown.
* Once the shallots are golden brown, immediately use a slotted spoon to transfer the hot shallots to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Allow the excess oil to cool slightly and then transfer it to a heat-proof jar. The oil will keep for several weeks in the refrigerator.

## Finish the casserole:

* Remove the casserole from the oven and sprinkle the crispy shallots on top. Then, return to the oven for 5 minutes more.

## To serve:

* Serve the casserole alongside your favorite accompaniments and enjoy!

Add ½ cup of cream and whisk regularly to incorporate. Continue adding the cream in ½ cup increments, whisking after each addition, until all of the cream is added and the sauce is smooth. Cook over medium heat for an additional 34 minutes until thickened slightly. Season with salt, nutmeg, and white pepper. Turn off the heat.

#### Assemble the gratin:

* Arrange a layer of potatoesoverlapping them slightlyon the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Pour a third of the sauce over the top and use the back of your spoon to smooth it out to ensure even coverage. Next, add a third of the cheese.
* Arrange another layer of overlapping potatoes and add half of the remaining sauce. Scatter half of the mushrooms on top and add half of the remaining cheese. If your gratin appears to mound in the middle, use your hands to flatten it out (it happens to the best of us).
* Arrange the final layer of potatoes on top. Pour the remaining sauce on top. Note, if youre short on sauce, supplement with a few splashes of cream on top! Add the remaining cheese and then finish with the remaining mushrooms and leeks. Smooth it out.

#### Bake the gratin:

* Transfer the baking dish to the oven and bake for 45 minutes or until the potatoes are fork-tender and the sauce is bubbly and browned on top.

#### Prepare the breadcrumbs:

* Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter into a skillet. Cut the challah into large cubes and add it to the skillet. Cook, occasionally turning, for 3 minutes until golden brown all over. Turn off the heat.
* Transfer the bread cubes to a food processor with the parsley and garlic and pulse until finely minced. Set aside.

#### Broil the gratin:

* Remove the gratin from the oven and turn on the broiler. Scatter the breadcrumbs on top and transfer to the broiler for 1-3 minutes until golden brown on top. Turn off the heat.

#### To serve:

* Let the gratin stand at room temperature for 10 minutes. Serve warm. Enjoy!

Ingredients:  
Tangzhong  
\-85g milk  
\-15g all-purpose flour  


Dough  
\-50g sugar  
\-1tb yeast  
\-1tsp salt  
\-210g pumpkin puree  
\-1 large egg  
\-400g all-purpose flour  
\-4tb butter, melted  
\-neutral oil (to great the bowl and plastic wrap)  


Egg Wash  
\-1 large egg, beaten

  
Instructions:  
1. In a saucepan, pour 85g milk and 15g all-purpose flour. Turn the heat to medium and whisk. Whisk constantly until the milk thickens into a paste. Turn off the heat and move the milk paste into a large bowl to cool.  
2. Put the saucepan back on the stove and add in 4tb butter. Let the butter melt with the residual heat in the pan, or over low heat.  
3. In the large bowl, add 50g sugar, 1tb yeast, 1tsp salt, 210g pumpkin puree, 1 large egg, and the melted butter to the milk paste. Mix to combine the wet ingredients.  
4. Add in 400g all-purpose flour, and mix until a dough forms.  
5. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until the dough is smooth and a little bit tacky, about 10 minutes. The dough is very wet, so ideally you'd use a stand mixer to mix and knead the dough. If you don't have one, then use a bench scraper to help you knead by hand.  
6. Shape the dough into a ball and place into a slightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a slightly greased piece of plastic wrap, and let the dough rest at room temp for about 60-90min until almost doubled in size.  
7. In the meantime, prepare 10"" long pieces of kitchen twine for shaping the dough into pumpkins. Use three pieces of twine per pumpkin to make 6-section pumpkins, and four pieces for 8-section pumpkins.  
8. After the dough has risen, turn it out onto a floured work surface again. Cut off about 30-50g of dough for the stems, depending on how big you want the stems. Set this dough aside for now.  
9. Cut the remaining dough into 8-12 pieces, and roll each piece into a ball.  
10. Lay down the pieces of twine in a star shape , then place the dough ball on top of the intersection of the pieces of twine. Loosely tie the twine around the dough ball. Adjust the spacing of the twine if desired.  
11. Cut the stem dough into the same number of pieces, and shape it into stems however you like.  
12. Place the pumpkins and stems onto a parchment lined baking sheet, and cover with a kitchen towel. Let the dough rest at room temp for about 45min until they're puffy.  
13. Preheat the oven to 350F.  
14. Beat one large egg in a bowl, then brush the dough with the beaten egg. Bake at 350F for about 25min.  
15. Remove the bread from the oven to a cooling rack and let them cool for a few minutes.  
16. Remove the twine when the bread is cool enough to handle, then insert the stems into the middle of each pumpkin.

1kg=2.2lbs, 100ml=0.4cups

Ragout: 

* 1kg red deer, cut into 2cm cubes
* 2 large onions, cut into cubes
* 1/2 bottle semi-dry red wine
* 500ml game stock
* 1 bay leaf
* 5 juniper berries
* 1/2 cinnamon stick
* 1/4 vanilla pod
* 3 cloves
* 3 green cardamom pods
* 1/2 tsp lemon zest
* Salt and pepper 
* clarified butter

Dumplings: 

* 1kg potatoes 
* 2 eggs
* 100g potato starch
* 2tbs melted butter
* 1tsp each of salt, pepper and nutmeg

The red cabbage came in a glass, but I added an apple and cloves. For 400g cabbage I used 1/2 apple (in cubes) and 2 cloves. Heat everything in a pot for 15 minutes. 

**METHOD**

Put a pan on high heat and add clarified butter, then brown the meat all over. Remove the meat, add the onions to the pan, brown them as well. Re-add the meat and deglaze with wine and stock; reduce heat. 

Once the alcohol has vaporised, add water to just cover the meat. Add all the spices, preferably in a spice satchel. Simmer for roughly 90 minutes or until the meat is tender; keep the temperature in the pan just under the boiling point. Add lemon zest, and salt and pepper to taste just before the end.

If you want to make the dumplings yourself, cook the potatoes, then drain the water, and mash the potatoes. Add egg yolks, starch, melted butter, salt, pepper and nutmeg, and mix everything thoroughly. If the dough is too sticky, add more starch. 

Form tennis balls, put them into boiling water, and cook for a minute. Then reduce the heat, and let them sit in almost-boiling water for about 20 minutes. Start with a small test ball to make sure your dough sticks together in the water.",1638

**Ingredients**  
1 Refrigerated Pie Crust  
1-½ Cups Pecans, chopped  
4 Tablespoons Butter, unsalted  
1 Cup Light Brown Sugar  
1 Teaspoon Cinnamon  
¼ Teaspoon Nutmeg  
¾ Cup Corn Syrup  
1 Tablespoons Vanilla Extract  
3 Large Eggs  
**Instructions**  
Preheat oven to 350°F.  
Arrange the crust in a glass/ceramic pie dish (9"") then place in the refrigerator while you prepare the rest.  
In a pot heat the butter, sugar, vanilla and corn syrup until the sugar is melted.  
In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the cinnamon and nutmeg.  
Allow the sugar mixture to cool slightly before adding the egg mixture, constantly stirring so that the egg doesn't form.  
Remove the pie crust from the refrigerator and add the chopped pecans evenly over the bottom (the pecans will rise to the top during cooking)  
Fill the pie crust with the butter/egg mixture.  
Bake for 50 minutes. If it looks like the edges of the crust are browning too fast use foil to cover.  
**Notes**  
This pie is our favorite recipe and is delicious even with a store bought pie crust (pie dough), but if you have your own pastry recipe feel free to use it. It's perfect as a dessert at Thanksgiving dinner, it's right up there alongside a pumpkin pie and apple pie.  
  
I found using a glass/ceramic dish to yield best results.  
  
Crunchy pecans work the best in this classic pecan pie... make sure yours are fresh.  
  
You could use a light corn syrup if you prefer, or I've also heard people use pure maple syrup too.  
  
Grab yourself a large bowl and add a scoop of vanilla ice cream for the best taste!

## Equipment

* Skillet
* 9×13 Baking Dish
* Baking sheet

## Ingredients

* 1 pound challah or brioche bread cut into bite-sized cubes
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 sweet onions peeled and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons butter divided
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 4 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and small-diced
* 1 tablespoon fresh thyme minced
* 1 tablespoon fresh sage leaves minced
* 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary minced
* 3 cups vegetable stock
* 2 eggs
* 4 tablespoons butter melted
* 2 teaspoons fig miso or white miso
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Cooking spray or butter for greasing the baking dish

## Instructions

## Dry out the bread:

* Preheat oven to 200ºF. Arrange the diced bread on a baking sheet and transfer to the oven for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, grease a 9×13 baking dish.
* Remove the bread from the oven and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Turn the heat on the oven to 350ºF.

## Caramelize the onions:

* Heat the oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes until they just begin to deepen in color. Sprinkle with salt and reduce heat to medium-low. Continue cooking for 30 minutes or until the onions begin to caramelize. Stir them occasionally, but dont disturb them too often or else they wont caramelize.
* Melt 1 tablespoon butter into the onions and sprinkle the sugar on top. Continue cooking for 1015 minutes until they are fully caramelized.
* Spoon half of the onions into a bowl and pour the remaining half over the diced bread and toss gently to distribute them evenly.

## Cook the celery:

* Return the skillet to the stovetop over medium heat. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter into the celery and cook for 78 minutes until it just begins to soften. Add the minced herbs and toss to coat. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the celery mixture over the bread and toss gently to distribute the celery evenly.

## Prepare the liquid:

* Combine the vegetable stock and eggs in a bowl and whisk until completely combined. Pour over the bread.

## Bake the stuffing:

* Scatter the remaining caramelized onions on top of the stuffing. Cover with foil and transfer to the oven for 35 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking an additional 10 minutes until the middle has set and the top is golden brown. Remove the stuffing from the oven and turn on the broiler.

## Prepare the miso butter:

* Combine the melted butter and miso in a bowl and whisk until smooth. Pour the mixture over the stuffing.

## Broil the stuffing:

* Transfer the stuffing to the oven under the broiler for 23 minutes. Keep an eye on it so that it doesnt burn, but the butter should cause the bread to crisp up and turn deep golden brown. Remove from the oven.

## To serve:

* Serve the stuffing warm. Keep leftovers in an airtight container for 34 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer for up to a month. Enjoy!

The easiest bread I know how to bake. The gluten is developed when mixing the flour and water and by later stretching the dough with wet hands. This is a no mess bread, a so called wet-dough, that stays moist for several days after baking. Enjoy.  


Ingredients   
550 grams bread flour (mine has between 11-12% gluten)  
430 ml warm water  
2 grams dry yeast  
8 grams salt  
1. Mix the yeast and salt with the warm water and let it sit for a couple of minutes to rehydrate.   
2. With a fork, begin to beat in the flour. As in the video, the more flour you add in, the more you'll be able to turn the batter over onto itself. This it to help form the gluten.   
3. Once you've added all the flour, cover and let it rest for half an hour.   
4. Take a bowl of water and place it near your dough. Dip your hands into the water then reach in and pull the dough. Stretch and pull that dough until it's tight. If the dough ever feels sticky, dip your hands back in the water.  
5. Let the dough rest another half hour and repeat the process.  
6.  Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured workspace and shape the dough (I prefer a loaf pan but round loaf works well.. Dip your hands in water and use a pastry scraper to help you. Resist the urge to add flour!  
7. Let the dough rest for 60-90 minutes, till it has almost trippled.  
8. Bake in a hot 220C/430F for 20 minutes, then turn down the oven to 190C/380F. (Throw a few ice cubes in the oven at the beginning to create steam which helps the bread rise further.)  
9. Let cook on a wire rack and enjoy.  
Note: I often bake this bread when I have a free morning or afternoon. I let the dough rise 90 minutes each time while I run errands and take care of things, coming back to beat it down. In my opinion, the longer rising times improve the flavor of the finished bread.   
I also make this early evening and put it in the fridge for the final rise. Just put a piece of buttered/oiled wrap on it to prevent the top from drying. In the morning, let it rest on the counter for 30 - 60 minutes before putting it in the oven.",2206

1.Combine yeast with lukewarm milk and leave to activate for around 10 minutes.

2.Mix all the remaining ingredients with yeast and milk mixture adding melted butter at the end. Work the dough for a few minutes until smooth in touch (the dough will be sticky to start with, do not add any more flour) you can use a stand mixer with a hook attachment for this.

3.Shape the dough to a ball and rest in the metal bowl covered with cloth in a warm place until doubles in size (around 1,5h) If the ambient room temperature is low, warm up the bowl with hot water as this will help to speed up the process.

**Ingredients**  
2lb Boudin Sausage Links  
2 Large Eggs  
½ Cup Buttermilk  
1 Tablespoon Creole Seasoning  
2 Cups Breadcrumbs, plain  
1 Teaspoon Onion Powder  
1 Teaspoon Garlic Powder  
1 Cup All Purpose Flour  
Oil, for frying  
**Instructions**  
Remove casing from Boudin Sausage links with kitchen shears.  
Roll Boudin Sausage meat into 1-½"" Balls, then refrigerate for 1 hour or more.  
Beat eggs in a medium sized bowl.  
Add the buttermilk to the eggs and mix together.  
In another medium sized bowl mix the seasonings with the breadcrumbs.  
Set up your dredging stations, with the flour in a bowl first, then the egg/buttermilk mix and last the breadcrumb mix.  
Remove the boudin balls from the refrigerator and coat each one in the flour first, then into the egg/buttermilk mix and last the breadcrumbs.  
Heat frying oil to 350°F (at least 2"" deep) and fry until golden (about 3-4 minutes). Serve right away with a dip.  
**Notes**  
Depending on the brand of Boudin Sausage that you buy, some are more dry/wet than others. Our favorite boudin is on the dryer side so I sprinkle the sausage meat with a little water to get the mixture to stick together well. If your chosen boudin sausage is too wet try to squeeze the fluid out while rolling. Use the best boudin you can find that you enjoy.  
  
Putting the Boudin Balls into the refrigerator (or freezer) will ensure it doesn't fall apart before you coat and fry them.  
  
Some people use a food processor to get the rice mixture to the texture they're looking for.  
  
Make sure you have damp hands when pressing the boudin balls together, it'll help prevent sticking.",1742

To help you visualize the steps, here's the link to a video showing the process.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixqB1HfK\_bw  
**Base Recipe**  
1 pre-baked tart shell or pastry  
2 cups of milk  
40 grams of white flour (approx. 4tbs)  
56 grams of butter (approx. 3 tbs)  
1-2 cups of minced vegetable (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots are good options) OR  
1 -2 cups roasted vegetables, chopped  (such as kabocha, pumpkin, squash, turnips, parsnips)  
Salt to taste.   
**Optional Mix-Ins**  
1/2 - 1 cup cheese (parmesan or Swiss cheeses are especially good)  
1 teaspoon fresh herbs  
1 egg yolk   
1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg  
Minced bacon or ham  
**Make the White Sauce**  
 1. In a saucepan melt the butter.  
 2. Add all the flour at once and cook for about 3 minutes.  
 3. With a whisk in hand, add all of the milk at once and stir quickly and constantly until the flour mixture is dissolved. (The milk MUST be cold. If the milk is warm, you will create lumps in the sauce.)  
 4. With a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, continue to stir the mixture until it thickens. This should take 2 - 4 minutes over medium heat.   
 5. Add all of your minced vegetable and stir to incorporate.   
 6. Add in any mix-ins you would like to incorporate.  
 7. If you plan to bake, remove from heat and pour into a prepared tart shell and bake for 40 minutes at 180°C/350°F.  
 8. If you plan to serve without baking, continue to cook on the stove top for 5-10 minutes stirring constantly to ""cook"" the vegetable to your liking.   
 9. However you prepare it, it will thicken as it cools to room temperature.   
 10. Serve at room temperature or cold.   
   
**Note**: As a failsafe, you can prepare a mixture of tablespoon corn/potato starch dissolved in 3 tablespoons water. If your sauce is too liquid by the end of cooking (at the end of step 6) begin to add this solution to the mixture and stir vigorously to quickly thicken the sauce.",1938

* Add in the 7oz Ube Cookie Butter and mix well again until smooth.
* Take the pie crust out of the freezer and pour in the filling.  Smooth out top with a butter knife.
* Dot the remaining Ube Cookie butter all over the top in random places.  Using a clean butter knife make swirls with the Ube Cookie butter  by dragging the knife down and around and side to side.
* Place in the freezer for 3 and a half hours.Meanwhile, defrost the ready made coco whip in the refrigerator.

**Preparation:**

1. Brush 1 tbsp of olive oil over the pumpkin flesh, place cut sides down onto a baking sheet, roast in an oven set to 200 C for 30 minutes or until the flesh is soft. 

2. Place a pot over medium heat, add the butter and 3 tbsp of olive oil, melt the butter.

3. Add the onion with some salt, sweat for 3 minutes. Add the carrots and leek, cook for another 3 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic and apple, cook for 2 minutes. 

4. Add the chilli flakes, turmeric, paprika, potato, beans, stock, salt and pepper. Make a bouquet garni with the rosemary and thyme. Add it to the pot. Cover and cook for 30 minutes.

5. Remove the herbs, add the pumpkin flesh (discard the skin), sour cream and vinegar, then blend until smooth. If too thick, add some water or stock. If too thin - cook and reduce.

The potato in this recipe is completely optional, it adds to the creaminess but it can be omitted. So are the beans - these additionally add some more protein to the soup, making it more hearty.

The green apple adds some acidity, but also optional. 

I used chicken stock, but you could use veggie stock instead to make this dish vegetarian. 

I served the soup with some fried chorizo, roasted pumpkin seeds, chives and toasted bread.

* Sieve
* Heatproof bowls

### Ingredients

#### Chicken broth:

* 3- pound whole chicken giblets removed and discarded
* 5 ribs celery roughly chopped
* 1 onion quartered
* 1 head garlic halved lengthwise
* 5 sprigs thyme
* 1 sprig rosemary
* 2-3 fresh bay leaves or 1-2 dry bay leaves
* 1 bunch parsley torn or cut in half
* 1 tablespoon black peppercorns
* Salt
* Water

#### Chicken noodle soup:

* 1 tablespoon oil for sautéing
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 4 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and diced
* 5 carrots trimmed, peeled, and diced
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1½ cups noodles of choice such as fusilli, farfalle, orzo, or wide egg noodles
* ¼ teaspoon white pepper
* 1 tablespoon fresh dill minced
* S cup fresh parsley minced
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice

### Instructions

#### Simmer the stock:

* Place the chicken in a stock pot. Add the celery, onion, garlic, thyme, rosemary, bay leaves, parsley, and black peppercorns on top. Season liberally with salt. Add water, covering the chicken by 1 inch.
* Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 34 hours, skimming off any foam or scum that floats to the top.

#### Cool the chicken:

* Remove the chicken and garlic halves from the broth and set them aside cool.

#### Hard simmer the broth:

* Being the broth to a hard simmer (just below boiling) for 30 minute to 40 minutes or until it reduces slightly and takes on a dark golden color.

#### Strain the broth:

* Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard solids. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.

#### Prepare the chicken and garlic:

* Discard chicken skin and pick meat from the bones. Shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Discard carcass. Pop the garlic from the paper and transfer to a small bowl.
* At this point, you may refrigerate the broth, chicken, and cooked garlic for 4-8 hours and remove the congealed fat from the top of the broth. Or you can continue on with the recipe as-is and simply remove any congealed chicken fat from the soup the next day.

#### Sauté the soup aromatics:

* Heat 1 tablespoon oil in the stockpot over medium heat. Add the diced onion, celery, and carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, for at least 10 minutes until they begin to soften and char. Season lightly with salt.

#### Cook the garlic paste:

* Melt the butter into the aromatics. Once bubbly, add the reserved, cooked garlic and mash it into the aromatics until a smooth paste forms.

#### Simmer the soup:

* Add the shredded chicken to the pot along with the strained broth. Add an additional 34 cups water or enough to cover the soup ingredients by 2 inches. Simmer for an additional 2030 minutes or until the carrots are tender. *Note: you may need to add more water, as necessary, depending on how salty and reduced your broth became from the hard simmer. Just taste and add ½ cup of water at a time as necessary!*

#### Cook the noodles:

* Taste the broth and adjust the seasonings as necessary. Bring to a boil. Add the noodles and cook for 812 minutes or until just al dente.

#### Finish the chicken noodle soup:

* Once the noodles are tender, reduce heat and add the white pepper, dill, parsley, and lemon juice. Cook an additional 5 minutes. Once the herbs are bright green and the noodles are tender, turn off the heat.

#### To serve:

* Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with crusty bread. Enjoy!

**Ingredients**

***Cake***

* 8 tbsp butter (or margarine)
* 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* zest of one orange
* juice of one orange
* 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* a pinch of salt

  
***Filling***

* 4 apples 
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 tbsp cinnamon
* 3.5 tbsp butter (or margarine)

**Directions**

1. Leave a stick of butter out on your counter for about an hour, or until it reaches room temperature.  
(While you're waiting for the butter to soften, you can always get a head start on the recipe by working on the filling  instructions begin in step 5.)  
In a large bowl, combine wet ingredients: butter, Greek yogurt, sugar (not a traditional ""wet"" ingredient, but it goes here), vanilla extract, zest and juice of one orange (if using the same orange, you'll want to zest before cutting into the orange, and squeezing for its juice).
2. In another bowl, combine dry ingredients: baking powder and salt with flour. Slowly add dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredient mixture, kneading until dough is combined and elastic when stretched out. The dough will knead a little love to work the dry ingredients through it. Oh, that pun was very much intended.  
Dough too dry? Add a splash of water. Too wet and sticky? A little more flour should do the trick.
3. Divide dough into two equal parts and form into a ball. Wrap both with plastic wrap and move to the refrigerator, chilling for at least 30 minutes.
4. While dough is chilling (or if you're waiting for your butter to soften) wash and then grate apples using the coarse edge of your grater (the side with the large holes).  
I prefer to leave the skin onit contains most of the apple's nutrients, after allbut if that's not your jam, feel free to peel the apple before you grate it.
5. Using a tea towel or paper towel, squeeze as much liquid as you can from the grated apples.  
My preferred method is putting the grated apple in a strainer, covered with a doubled-up paper towel, and then pressing the liquid out with the weight of a couple bowls resting on top of the paper towel. You can leave the apples to drain while you work on other parts of this recipe.  
You won't believe how much liquid comes out of these apples!
6. In a large bowl, combine grated apples with the cinnamon and sugar. Stir until well-combined.
7. Heat 3.5 tbsp butter (or margarine) in a saucepan. Add grated apple, cinnamon and sugar mixture to the pan, and cook until tender, approximately ten minutes. The mixture will look and smell like the caramel on a caramel apple. No judgement if you taste a bit of this step, just make sure it cools off, first!
8. Set aside mixture, and let cool. I return it to the same bowl I used to create the grated apple, cinnamon and sugar mixture, minimizing how many bowls I use.
9. When you remove the dough from the refrigerator, begin by pre-heating the oven to 350°F.
10. Grease or butter a 9x9"" cooking dish or baking tray. Stretch out one ball of dough so it's pressed into the bottom of the dish, covering the dish from edge to edge. Using a fork, prick it all over. Cook for 30 minutes.  
**Note**: If you have two dishes of the same size, that will fit side-by-side in your oven, you can cook both pieces of dough at the same time. If not, I like to leave the second ball of dough in the fridge. It won't hurt the dough by staying in longer.
11. Allow to cool on a cooling rack while repeating step 11 with the other ball of dough.  
Spread cooled apple mixture evenly over the bottom piece of cake while the top piece is cooking.
12. Once the top piece of cake is cooked, allow it to cool and then place on top of the apple mixture that's already spread over the bottom piece.
13. The traditional Romanian topping is dusted with powdered sugar, but can you imagine the variations you can try? Drizzled homemade caramel with crushed walnuts, a cinnamon and sugar crumble, a layer of thin-sliced apples . . . the options are endless!   

14. If you do choose to go the traditional route, the best way to do so is with a flour sifter.  
Cut into squares (the size of your choosing) and se bucura/enjoy!",4263

**Enjoy the recipe and United Cuisines on Youtube!**

INGREDIENTS \[20 Lamingtons in 9x9 in / 22 x 22 cm baking pan\]

For the batter:

\- 4 eggs

\- fine caster sugar \[150 g\]

\- all purpose flour \[1.5 cups / 180 g\]

\- baking powder \[1 tsp\]

\- unsalted butter \[2 tbsp / 25 g\]

For the coating:

\- powdered/icing sugar \[2.5 cups / 250 g\]

\- cocao powder \[5 tbsp / 30 g\]

\- unsalted butter \[2 tbsp / 25 g\]

\- milk \[1/2 cup / 120 ml\]

\- desiccated coconut flakes \[3 cups / 200 g\]

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Start by greasing your baking pan, properly line it with parchment paper and set aside. Pre-heat oven to 350°F / 180°C
2. To make the batter for the sponge cake, grab an electric mixer and a big bowl, crush the eggs and add the fine sugar. Begin whisking and beat the mass for a few minutes, till it drastically increases in size by almost 200%. Once the color desaturates and the batter turns less runny and starts to stick to your whisk, you can stop
3. Begin to gently incorporate the all purpose flour and baking powder, which you put into a mesh strainer and sift 1/4th of it over the batter. Gently fold it into the batter with a wooden spoon or spatula. Repeat the step 3 times with the remaining flour
4. Melt 2 tbsp of butter and fold it into the batter, as well as a teaspoon of vanilla extact, if you like
5. Transfer the batter into your lined baking pan and spread it all over, before giving it 1, 2, max 3 good tappy taps, in order to bring big bubbles to the surface. Don't overdo it, though! Remember, we created those many small bubbles on purpose, in order to get a spongy cake
6. Place in the middle of your pre-heated oven and bake for 15-25 minutes, depending on the oven and what sort of pan, glass or metal, you use
7. In parallel, take a medium-size bowl and combine the sifted icing sugar and sifted cocao powder
8. Pour the milk into your saucepan, add the butter and heat up together, till butter is melted and milk hot. Add it to the bowl and mix well, till sugar and cacao are dissolved. Let rest till completely cooled down
9. Get the cake out of the oven once done and place it on a cooling reck. Remove the parchment paper, and let cool down completely
10. Depending on your baking pan, the cake might end up with uneven edges, which you shall level, before cutting the whole cake in into beautiful squares of around 2 inch / 5 cm. You should end up with 20 pieces
11. Get two bowls ready, distribute 1/3 of the cacao-sauce in one and 1/3 desiccated coconuts in the other. Coat the sponge cakes well in the cacao sauce first, preferably use forks, elevate and let drain for a few seconds over the sauce-bowl, before dropping them into the coconuts. Use a spoon or your hands to fully cover the cakes in white coconuts flakes and transfer them on a rack to rest
12. Enjoy!

2021-10-25,1,"Irish Barmbrack - Sweet Halloween Treat","leviathanfood","Barmbrack, Irish tea brack or in Irish, bairín breac (meaning speckled loaf) is a traditional sweetened bread commonly made around the Halloween season in Ireland. Many of the older traditional recipes use yeast, and are lighter in colour and texture than the bracks most people come across today. 

For this recipe I referenced many different sources, including my mothers copy of All In The Cooking, first published in 1946 and famous Irish flour makers Odlums well established directions.I went through a few tests to find the right balance that worked for me and did my own take on it. I found light brown demerara sugar best and added a glaze of orange and honey. Its customary to place a ring wrapped in parchment paper inside the brack, with the tradition saying that whoever finds it in their slice is meant to marry that year. There are other regional gifts or tricks that have been reported to have been included inside the loaves, such as a pea  meaning you wont marry that year, a stick for an unhappy marriage, a piece of cloth for poverty and a coin for riches and wealth.

**Ingredients:**

2 teabags

300ml boiling water

250g mixed peel

120g sultanas 

125g light brown demerera sugar

225g self-raising flour

1 egg

1 tsp. mixed spice

1 tbsp. honey

1 segment fresh orange

**Method:**

1.) Brew a batch of strong tea with the boiling water and the teabags and allow to cool completely. Add the mixed peel and sultanas to a large bowl and soak them evenly in the tea overnight.

2.) Preheat the oven to 170°C (340 °F). Butter and line a 900g (2lb) loaf tin with parchment paper.

3.) Beat the egg and add it to the mixture and give it a stir before sieving in the flour and spice mix. Add the sugar and give the whole thing a good stir with a wooden spoon.You are looking for an even, smooth and slightly runny batter that falls off the spoon after 1  2 seconds. If you feel the mixture is a little bit dry you can add a drop of water or more cold tea if you have it to hand.

4.) Transfer the batter into the loaf tin and place it in the oven. If you are adding a ring wrap it in greaseproof paper and pop it in before baking. You are aiming for a 1hour bake, but its wise to check it after 45 minutes to make sure it isnt browning too much on the top. If this is the case, simply turn the heat down a bit. Check the centre with a chopstick or a cake tester, if it comes out clean the brack is baked.

5.) Add the honey and a good squeeze of fresh orange juice to a small pan on a medium heat and allow it to reduce to a syrup. Brush this over the top as soon as the brack comes out of the oven and allow it to cool on a wire rack. Keep in a sealed container once cooled and the brack will continue to moisten in the coming days.",2903
2021-10-24,3,"Beyond Meat Lasagne Bolognese","Elomack","Beyond Meat Lasagne Bolognese 


**Ingredients:**


**Meat sauce:**

- 3 tbsp vegetable oil

- 500g beyond beef, mince

- 1 large onion, chopped

- 2 celery stalks, chopped

- 1 medium carrot, chopped

- 3 cloves of garlic, minced

- 1 tsp tomato paste

- 1 tsp fennel seeds, ground

- 100ml dry red wine

- 400g chopped tomatoes (I used canned)

- 500ml veggie broth

- 1/2 tsp ground pepper

- 1 tbsp sugar

- Salt to taste


**White sauce:**

- 1 tbsp unsalted butter

- 1 tbsp AP flour

- 250ml warm milk

- 100g Parmesan cheese, grated

- 1/2 tsp nutmeg

- 300g ricotta cheese

- Salt and pepper to taste


**Assembly:**

- lasagne sheets

- 250g fresh mozzarella cheese

- A bunch of Basil


**Preparation:**

1. Heat a pot with vegetable oil over high heat. Once its really hot, add the beyond beef, and let it brown for 2 minutes. Dont disturb it, otherwise it wont brown properly. Add the onion, cook for 3 minutes. Add the carrots and celery, cook for another 3 minutes. Add the garlic, tomato paste, fennel seeds and give it another minute. Add the red wine, tomatoes, broth, sugar, salt and pepper. Simmer for at least 1 hour, the sauce should be pretty thick by then. 

2. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the flour and cook for a minute or two, but dont let it brown. Slowly pour in the milk while constantly whisking. Cook until thickened, remove from heat and add the Parmesan. Keep whisking until the cheese melts, then add the ricotta, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix well.

3. Assembly. Get an oven-safe pan. Start with a thin layer of meat sauce, then keep alternating between lasagne sheets, meat sauce and white sauce as many times as you can. When you get to the middle layer (depending on how tall your pan is), add the basil and half of the mozzarella. Keep layering as before. When you get to the last layer, finish with the rest of the mozzarella.

4. Cover with aluminum foil and cook for 25 minutes in an oven preheated to 200C. Remove the foil and cook uncovered for another 25 minutes.

5. Remember to let it rest for at least 15 minutes once its out of the oven.


When it comes to the white sauce - some people prefer bechamel, some a mixture of ricotta and egg. My favorite is combining a bechamel with Parmesan (thus making a mornay sauce) AND also adding ricotta.


I used lasagne sheets that dont require precooking.

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour 5 minutes 

Servings: 24 bars 

Calories: 187kcal

## Ingredients

* 2½ cups all purpose flour
* 1½ teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon kafe hawaij or pumpkin pie spice
* 1 cup unsalted butter at room temperature
* 1 cup light brown sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 15- ounce can pumpkin puree
* 1 cup labneh
* S cup granulated sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* ¼ cup maple syrup

## Instructions

* Preheat oven to 350ºF.

## Prepare the dry ingredients:

* In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and kafe hawaij (or pumpkin pie spice).

## Prepare the wet ingredients:

* Place the unsalted butter in a large mixing bowl and beat with a hand-mixer until whipped and smooth. Add the brown sugar and continue mixing until combined.
* Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat for 1 minute.
* Add the pumpkin puree to the wet ingredients and beat until just combined and smooth.

## Combine the wet and dry ingredients:

* Slowly pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Do NOT overmix. It will look a bit lumpy and not as smooth as cake batter, and that's okay. Wash off the beaters.

## Prepare the baking sheet:

* Line the baking sheet with parchment paper, leaving an overhang of paper on all sides.
* Add half the pumpkin mixture to the baking sheet, using a rubber spatula to smooth it out. Set aside.

## Prepare the labneh mixture:

* Wipe out the bowl used for the flour.
* Place the labneh in the bowl. Mix on high with the hand mixer until smooth. Add the sugar, egg, maple syrup, and vanilla extract and continue mixing until completely smooth. Taste and add more maple syrup if you prefer a sweeter labneh.

## Finish preparing the baking sheet:

* Using a spoon, drop half the labneh mixture over the layer of pumpkin mixture and use a toothpick to create a swirl pattern.
* Pour the remaining pumpkin mixture on top and smooth it out with a spatula. It won't be perfect but that's okay! Drop the remaining labneh mixture on top and smooth it out once more and ensure the mixture goes edge-to-edge.

## Bake the pumpkin bars:

* Transfer the baking sheet to the preheated oven for 3545 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

## To serve:

* Allow the bars to cool completely before cutting. Serve with whipped cream and a dusting of kafe hawaij.
* Store the bars in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

Recipe video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/z6MELVQGqjQ)  
  
Ingredients: \[6 portions\]

**Chocolate cake**  
85 g (5 pcs) egg yolks  
12 g (1 tbsp) granulated sugar  
60 g (¼ cup) vegetable oil  
60 g (¼ cup) milk  
20 g (3 tbsp) cocoa powder  
45 g (3 tbsp) hot water  
90 g (½ cup+3 tbsp) cake flour  
170 g (5 pcs) egg white  
75 g (6 tbsp) granulated sugar  
  
**Buttercream**  
113 g (½ cup) unsalted butter  
80 g (¼ cup) sweetened condensed milk

Instructions:

**Chocolate cake**

1. Dilute cocoa powder with hot water. Set aside.
2. Whisk egg yolks along with 12 grams of sugar. Add oil and mix until well-combined. Then add milk and mix well.
3. Sieve in the flour in two batches. Mix after each addition until the batter is smooth. Mix in the diluted cocoa. Set aside.
4. Beat egg white until frothy with an electric mixer running at high speed. Then gradually add sugar as you mix. Continue beating until it almost reaches stiff peak consistency.
5. Mix in 1/4 of beaten egg white into the cake batter using a spatula or a hand whisk. Then add another 1/4 of egg white. From here on, we want to gently combine the mixture. Be careful not to deflate the batter. Again, mix in another 1/4 portion. Add the remaining egg white. Mix just until no white streaks are seen.
6. Pour batter into an 11-inches (28 cm) square pan that has been lined with parchment paper. Spread the batter evenly. Tap the pan twice onto the counter to remove air bubbles.
7. Bake in a preheated oven at 285°F (140°C) for 20 minutes, then increase to 320°F (160°C) and continue baking for 15 minutes. Once baked, remove the cake from its pan and let cool completely.

**Buttercream**

1. Beat the softened butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add condensed milk and mix just until combined.

**Assembly**

1. Cut and divide the cake equally into two. Spread the buttercream over one piece of the cake. Cover it with the other piece to make a sandwich.
2. \[Optional\] Trim all four sides of the cake with a serrated knife to get clean-cut edges.
3. Divide the cake equally into three rectangular pieces. Then cut each piece diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner to get triangular cake slices.",2305

**Ingredients:**

- 650g beef chuck

- 2 large onions, julienned

- 3 medium carrots, grated

- 1 tsp coriander seeds, ground

- 1 tsp cumin seeds, ground

- 1 tsp paprika

- 1 tsp chilli flakes

- 3-5 bay leaves

- 1 cup of water

- 1 tsp fresh rosemary

- 1 head of garlic

- 400g basmati rice

- 600ml beef stock

- Vegetable oil to cook

- Salt and pepper to taste


**Preparation:**

1. Heat vegetable oil in a pot over high heat. When its really hot, add the beef and brown it. Work in batches if you must - dont overcrowd the pot, otherwise it wont brown properly and the beef will lose a lot of moisture.

2. Add the onion, carrots, coriander, cumin, paprika, chilli, bay leaves, salt and pepper. Cook for around 5 minutes.

3. Add the saffron to 1 cup of hot water, and then pour it into to the pot, along with the tomatoes, rosemary, lemon juice and lemon zest. Stir well. 

4. Cut the bottom of a head of garlic, place it directly in the pot, cover and simmer for 40 minutes.

5. Remove and reserve the garlic. Spread rice over the meat and cover with beef stock. Depending on how salty your stock is, this is when you would want to add some salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and cook for around 15-20 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed.

6. Remove the garlic and bay leaves. Stir gently and serve. 


The amount of ingredients might seem overwhelming, but this is a one pot dish with no difficult techniques involved - give it a try!

2 racks of pork ribs, approx 1-1.5 lbs each  
1 tsp of salt  
2 tsp of paprika  
1/2 tsp of oregano  
1/2 tsp of allspice  
1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper  
1/4 tsp of white pepper  
1/4 tsp of cumin  
3 cloves of garlic, minced or finely chopped  
3 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil  
Mike's hot honey or preferred honey for drizzling (as desired/optional)

directions:  
mix your spices all together in a small bowl, and add in minced garlic, mixing again  
pat the ribs dry with a paper towel, and proceed to rub the spice mix on both sides of the ribs.  
once the ribs are coated in the dry rub, drizzle the extra virgin olive oil across the ribs and end it with a drizzle of honey across the ribs (I prefer Mike's Hot Honey for this, but any honey will do!).  
FOR THE OVEN: on a parchment paper-lined baking tray, roast the ribs at 250 for 3 to 3 and 1/2 hours, flipping twice through out -- you're last flip should have the ribs facing head up, the back of the ribs lying atop the tray. always be sure to check the internal temperature to be sure the ribs are properly cooked.  
FOR THE INSTANT POT SLOW COOKER: wrap the ribs around the inner sides of the Instant Pot (like the photo above), and cook on low for eight hours. Once the ribs are done, I always like to move them on to a baking tray and put it in the oven on broil/or at 375 for 10 minutes to get the crispy texture on the outside.",1524

**Ingredients:**


**Dough:**


- 650g of 00 flour

- 7g dry yeast

- 350ml water

- 1 tsp salt

- 1 tbsp olive oil


**Sauce:**


- 400g chopped tomatoes

- 3-4 small garlic cloves

- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes

- 2 tbsp olive oil

- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar

- 1/2 tsp salt

- 1 tsp sugar


**Toppings:**


- fresh mozzarella

- pepperoni

- parmesan cheese

- olive oil

- garlic


**Preparation:**


1. Hydrate the yeast in water. Let sit until foamy, around 15 minutes. 

2. Mix the flour with salt. Add the yeasty mixture and olive oil. Knead until smooth. Cover and let rise - from a few hours in a warm area to 48 hours in the fridge. The longer the rise, the more complex the flavors developed.

3. Prepare the sauce. Sauté the garlic with some olive oil, add the chilli flakes for just a few seconds, then add the tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, salt, and sugar.

4. Blend the sauce until smooth, then slowly simmer until reduced and thickened. 

5. Divide the dough into 4 and shape into balls. Rest for 30 minutes.

6. Take one of the balls and stretch it. Move it onto a pizza peel and start the assembly: spread some of the sauce, add the cheese and any other toppings you might like. I just wanted some simple pepperoni.

7. Place it over a hot pizza stone, in an oven preheated to at least 250C. Cook for 5-6 minutes.

8. As soon as the pizza is out of the oven, I like brushing the edges with a bit of garlic-infused olive oil. Some grated Parmesan cheese on top will make a great addition, as it will quickly melt. 

This recipe is pretty much a simple pizza dough and a cooked tomato sauce with a bit of a spicy and tangy twist. 
Feel free to use any toppings you like.

No, this is not a classic Italian pizza :)

Cover it with a clear wrap and then with kitchen cloth. Keep the bowl in a warm place or inside your oven with just the light on. It will take a minimum of 2 hours for the dough to rise.
* Once the bread dough rises and doubles in size, scrape it carefully to a floured board and roll it into a rough 25 x 35 cm rectangle. Brush ½ tablespoon of oil followed by the pesto sauce. Then, sprinkle the grated cheese.
* Using a sharp knife, slice the rolled dough into roughly 5 equal parts. Stack the slices on one top of each other, and then slice the stacked dough into 5 roughly equal size squares/rectangles.
* Take a 9x5 loaf pan and carefully place the sliced squares/rectangles one after the other. Cover the loaf pan with a clear wrap and leave it for the second rise. It should take about an hour.
* After the slices rise and are puffed up, preheat the oven to 350F.
* Rub the rest of the oil on top and place it on the middle rack of the oven. Bake it for 40 minutes, or until the bread looks golden on top.
* Allow it to cool for a while before releasing it from the pan. To release the bread, just run a knife on the side and the bread should come out easily.
* Serve it warm, as it tastes best when fresh.",2587

 Cook Time: 10 minutes

 Servings: 2-4 people


INGREDIENTS

2 eggs

6 tablespoons milk

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

4 slices of good quality bread (cut thickly)

10g butter

2 tablespoons sugar

INSTRUCTIONS

Whisk the egg, milk and vanilla together in a large bowl, until combined.

Take your loaf (anything you like) and slice it thickly. Take each slice of bread and dip into the egg mixture, allowing a few seconds for it to soak up the liquid, then turn over and repeat.

Heat the butter in a frying pan, then fry the bread on each side until golden (about two minutes each side). You may need to do this in batches, depending on how large your pan is.

Combine the sugar and cinnamon, and then pour onto a large plate. Place the hot french toast on top and then turn over so that your bread is evenly coated with the sugar mixture.

Melt the milk chocolate and then drizzle over, finishing off with raspberries, strawberries or anything else you fancy. Enjoy!",1307

**Ingredients:**

- 650g AP flour

- 80g sugar

- 15g salt

- 230ml milk

- 60ml water

- 7g dry yeast

- 50g melted, unsalted butter

- 2 eggs


**Preparation:**

1. Scald the milk. Heat it up in a small saucepan, as soon as it starts boiling remove from heat and chill (preferably in an ice bath). 

2. Combine the scalded milk with water. Make sure the temperature is not above 35C. Add 15g of sugar and dry yeast. Mix and let sit until foamy (around 15 minutes).

3. Prepare the dough - you can to this by hand or in a stand mixer. Mix well the flour, salt and 65g of sugar. Add 30g of melted butter, the yeasty mixture and the eggs. Knead until smooth. Cover and rest for 2-3 hours.

4. Take out the dough, divide and shape into balls. Place on a greased baking tray, cover and proof for 40 minutes.

5. Uncover the dough, lightly sprinkle with water and bake in 190C for 15 minutes.
6. As soon as the rolls come out of the oven, brush with melted butter.


By scalding the milk you denaturate some of the proteins. This helps with the dough rise, and it ensures a softer structure of the final product.


When it comes to the rest time of the dough, it all depends on personal preference. As with any yeasty dough, the longer you let the yeast work, the more esters will be created which might contribute to a sweeter, fruity taste. I like these rolls fairly neutral but whatever floats your boat. 


And please dont omit the melted butter at the end, it really does make a difference!

**EQUIPMENT**    

* Iron Tava (Pan)    

* Sieve    

* Electric Chopper    

**INGREDIENTS**    

  **PART 1**    

* 4 Fresh Chicken Breast cut into medium pieces    

* 2 tbsp Ginger Garlic Paste    

**PART 2**    

* 2 Green Chillies    

* 2 medium Onions cut into medium pieces    

* ¼ cup Coriander Leaves finely chopped    

* ¼ cup Mint Leaves finely chopped    

**SPICES**    

* 2 tbsp Coriander Powder    

* 2 tbsp Cumin Powder    

* ½ tsp Red Chilli Powder    

* Salt as needed    

* Oil as needed for shallow frying    

**INSTRUCTIONS**    

1) Using an electric chopper finely chop all ingredients mentioned in Part 2    

2) Remove it in a sieve and use a spoon to press down the onion mix to drain out the excess liquid.    

3) Once done set aside in a mixing bowl    

4) Using the same electric chopper finely mince the ingredients mentioned in Part 1    

5) Remove it in the same sieve to drain out any excess liquid.    

6) Once done mix it with the onion mixture.    

7) Now, add all the ingredients mentioned in the Spices to the mixing bowl. Mix it thoroughly until well combined.    

8) Cover the bowl and let it rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours.    

9) Now before you start shaping the kebab mixture, oil your palms and fingers well. This will ensure that the mixture doesnt stick to your hands while you try to form them.    

10)Take a small amount of the kebab mixture and flatten it out on your palm while shaping it. Place it on a plate while you repeat this step for the remaining mixture. I was able to make 28 kebabs however you can probably make more or less depending on how big or small you want the kebab to be.    

11) In a cast iron tava (pan) drizzle some oil on medium low flame. Once hot put the formed kebabs in without cluttering the pan to much.    

12) Cook on 1 side till you see the sides have started to become golden brown and then flip it over and cook on the other side.    

13) The flame should be on medium low so that the chicken gets cooked thoroughly.    

14) When cooked remove it on kitchen paper towels so that the excess liquid has been drained out.    

15) You can serve this with onions rings and lemon wedge.    

**NOTES**    

* If you need help with any Herb or Spice listed in this recipe then refer to the guide: List of Herbs and Spices    

* Always at first fry just 1 kebab and see if it doesnt break and the seasoning is right or not because you can always adjust the mixture before you start shaping the others.    

* I have not used any binding agent however if you feel the kebabs are breaking while frying then add 1 beaten egg to the mixture before shaping it. Or if you are allergic to egg then instead of using an egg as a binding agent you can dry roast 2 tbsp Gram flour and when cooled you can add that to the mixture.",2964

#### Start the risotto:

* Heat 2 teaspoons of neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook for 5 minutes until softened.
* Melt the butter into the shallots. Once frothy, add the minced sage leaves and cook for 1 minute.
* Add the rice and toss to coat. Cook for 2 minutes until the rice begins to toast slightly. Sprinkle everything lightly with salt and pepper.
