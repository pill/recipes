I've been obsessed with Calabrian chili peppers but if you don't have the oil or the hot honey replace as follows:

Hot Honey: Honey or maple syrup + cayenne powder or just your favorite brand of hot honey

Calabrian chili oil: Cayenne powder or chili oil of choice

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 50 minutes

Servings: 4

Calories: 549kcal

## Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot
* Hand mixer or whisk
* Sieve or colander
* Small pot, optional

## Ingredients

* 2 teaspoons neutral oil
* 1 onion peeled and diced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper or use paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon dry thyme crushed
* 28- ounce can whole-peeled tomatoes
* 1 teaspoon sugar more or less to taste to soften the acidity of the canned tomatoes
* 1 cup ricotta cheese
* 2 tablespoons whole milk
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon Calabrian hot honey
* 2 teaspoons Calabrian chili oil optional
* 12 ounces jumbo shells

## For serving:

* 2 ounces pine nuts or slivered almonds optional
* 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil optional
* Fresh or dry minced parsley

## Instructions

## Start the sauce:

* Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 710 minutes until softens and turns golden brown.
* Add that tomato paste and cook for 12 minutes until it darkens slightly.
* Melt the butter into the paste and add the pepper flakes and dry thyme. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring often, until the paste deepens in color and the aromatics become fragrant.

## Simmer the sauce:

* Pour in the whole-peeled tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Add the sugar. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low and simmer, breaking up with the tomatoes with a spoon as it cooks until the sauce is thickened. Add water or stock as necessary if the sauce reduces too quickly or sticks to the bottom.

## Cook the pasta:

* Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When the sauce is about 10 minutes away from finishing cooking, add the pasta. Right before draining, scoop out 1/4 cup of pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta and set aside. Time this so that you are draining the pasta right as the sauce finishes simmering!

## Prepare the whipped ricotta:

* Place the pine nuts in a small pot. Add the extra virgin olive oil and transfer to the stovetop. Turn the heat to medium. Once the oil bubbles, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes until the nuts turn light golden brown. Turn off the heat and set it aside.

## Prepare the pine nuts (if using):

* Place the pine nuts in a small pot. Add the extra virgin olive oil and transfer it to the stovetop. Turn the heat to medium. Once the oil bubbles, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes until the nuts turn light golden brown. Turn off the heat and set it aside.

## Finish the pasta:

* Taste the sauce and season to your preferences. Add the pasta cooking water to the sauce and bring to a low boil. Add the cooked shells and reduce heat to low. Toss to coat for 1 minute or until the pasta is completely coated with sauce. Turn off the heat.

## To serve:

* Spoon the whipped ricotta onto plates and pile the cooked pasta on top. Garnish with more hot honey and scatter the pine nuts on top. Sprinkle fresh or dry parsley on each plate. Enjoy!

**Ingredients**

4 medium potatoes  
2 eggs  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 ¼ cups flour  
2 tablespoons butter  
A few sprigs of basil

  
**Instructions**

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Wash, dry, and prick the potatoes all over with a knife or fork.
3. On a baking sheet, rub the potatoes with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in the oven to bake for 45 minutes-1 hour, or until the potatoes are tender.
4. Set the potatoes aside until they are cool enough to handle and peel the skin off. With a masher or ricer, break the potatoes down into a consistent mixture.
5. In a large bowl, combine the mashed/riced potatoes, two eggs, and salt. Mix until well combined.
6. On a large work surface, place the flour into a mound and make a small well. Place the potato-egg mixture into the well and begin to work in the flour. Knead the dough for about three minutes, or until the dough looks smooth and well combined.
7. Roll the dough into a short log, and cut into four equal pieces. Then proceed to roll these pieces out until it has reached a diameter of about half an inch. Using a knife or dough scraper, cut the long tubes into 1-inch pieces.
8. The gnocchi is perfectly ready to cook now, but if you wish to add a little textural design, make small creases using a fork or gnocchi paddle.
9. Bring a large pot of water to boil and salt generously.
10. Carefully drop the gnocchi into the water and cook just until they begin to float to the surface, about a minute. Drain and set aside.
11. Quickly, in a large saute pan over medium-high heat, drop in two tablespoons of butter. Once melted, toss in the gnocchi and cook until golden brown, about 3-5 minutes.

2021-10-11,7,"Soba Noodles in Sea Bream Stock with Arctic Char","FineDiningAtHome","Hi Reddit, nice to meet ya! This is my first post on Reddit. Im a home cook whos from an Asian background and living in the US currently. I love designing fusion food recipes.Here Im sharing this exciting fusion recipe I just created. The stock comes with such incredibly rich savouriness perfumes the refreshing soba noodles. Fish slice so tender that it almost melts in your mouth along with the soup itself.   


If you are interested in seeing more of my recipes, I'm also on IG: muxiwangpnw  


Serving 2

**Equipment**

Deep wok

Boiling pot

Frying pan

**Ingredients**

Japanese Soba Noodles 120g

Arctic Char or other 

Fish Fillet   weight depending on how much you want

Sea Bream Head 300g

Fresh ginger root 1 piece

Salt 1 tbsp

White Pepper 1tbsp

Scallions 2 grocery-store bunches

Pork lard (preferable) or vegetable oil 4 tbsp

Caviar (optional) 1 tbsp

Hot Water 1000ml

**Instructions**

*Sea Bream Stock*: Prepare the dish by washing and cutting the fish head into two halves; cut the ginger root into slices; cut the scallions, only use the roots for now, save the greens for future use. Use a deep wok, preheat it over high heat until it smokes. Add the pork lard or oil in and use it to evenly coat the wok. Fry the bream head skin side down until it turns golden brown, then flip it and continue frying until colored. Add in the aromatics until the pleasant smell emerges. Pour in boiled water. Keep it boiling over high heat for the fish bones to release their collagen. Turn the heat down low to continue the simmer for at least 30 minutes with your lid on. The stock should turn milky white by then! A lot of traditional Chinese chefs are resistant to add milk or cream to this dish, as they see using such ingredients as cheating. Personally, Im not against such techniques as they do further thicken and enrich the liquid. Though I dont use them in this recipe, I encourage you to try and make the decision yourself. Finally, flavor it with salt and white pepper (optional).

&amp;#x200B;

*Soba Noodles:* Boil the soba noodles for 4 minutes or until soft. Drain the noodles.

&amp;#x200B;

*Fish Slice:* Cut one thin slice off your fish fillet. Season it with salt, pepper, and oil. Heat a pan and sear the thin slice, 20 seconds on each side. (You can sear the whole fillet of course. We are only using the thin slice for the pretentious presentation&)

&amp;#x200B;

*Presentation:* Twirl the Soba Noodles and place them in a pasta bowl. Place in the fish slice. Pour the fish soup on the plate. Garnish the soup with a few drops of green oil and top the soba noodles with caviar(optional).",2628
2021-10-10,3,"Pumpkin Spice Cinnamon Rolls w/ Maple Cardamom Icing","GraemesEats","With how insanely overdone ""pumpkin spice"" is around this time, I figured: ""Hey, why not one more?"" so I made this delicious upgrade to cinnamon rolls! You can use canned pumpkin or fresh pumpkin puree, your own pumpkin spice, or a mix and you can include or exclude whatever you want from the icing!

Yield: 12 Rolls

If you'd like to see any part of this process, I've made a video, divided by chapters and you can click [here](https://youtu.be/COqDYsxOpHw) to go directly to it.

**Ingredients:**

Dough:

* 350g all-purpose flour
* 200g pumpkin puree
* 60g warm water
* 60g warm 2% milk
* 3 tbsp butter
* 2 1/4 tsp (1 pkg) dry active yeast
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt

Pumpkin Pie Spice:

* 1/2 tsp cloves
* 1 tsp allspice
* 3/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp ginger
* 1 tbsp cinnamon

Filling:

* 1/4 cup margarine (or butter, but I always forget to leave extra out)
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1 recipe \^\^\^ of pumpkin pie spice (roughly 2 tbsp)

Maple Cardamom Icing:

* 4 oz. warm cream cheese
* 1/4 cup 2% milk
* 60g maple syrup
* 1/4 tsp cardamom seed, ground
* 2 tbsp icing sugar

**Preparation:**

1. Mix together water, milk, yeast and 1 tbsp brown sugar.
2. When yeast is nice and foamy, add in all remaining dough ingredients except for 175g (or half) of flour and use a wooden spoon or paddle attachment to mix until combined.
3. Add remaining flour and knead in stand mixer on medium-high for about 5-6 minutes.
4. When dough is smooth and elastic, set aside in greased bowl to rise until doubled in size, approximately 1 hour.
5. While the dough is resting, you can make the spice mixture and icing by just combining the ingredients listed.
6. When dough has doubled in size, flour the top lightly, press out majority of the gas, and flip out onto a generously floured table.
7. Roll dough into a rectangle roughly 1/8 inch thick. You can either flour the top of the dough lightly or a rolling pin for this. I floured my dough.
8. Brush rolled out dough with 1/4 cup of margarine or soft butter, (I used margarine because my memory is similar to that of a goldfish and it's spreadable straight from the fridge) then evenly spread brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice overtop of the margarine.
9. Starting with one of the long sides, gently roll the dough up tightly, trying to avoid large gaps or air bubbles that may make the rolls fall apart.
10. Cut the resulting log into 12 equal pieces and set them cut sides down in a 9 inch oven-safe pan, covered, for 45 minutes to proof.
11. Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 20-25 minutes, until nicely browned and cooked through.
12. Top with icing if desired.",2617

**Ingredients:**


**Sauce:**


- 2 medium onions

- 3 cloves of garlic

- 1 large chilli pepper (use whatever type you like, depending on how spicy you want the sauce)

- 1 tsp ground cumin

- 1 tsp ground coriander seeds

- 1 tsp turmeric

- 2 tsp smoked paprika

- 1 tsp ground ginger

- 1 tsp sugar

- 500ml tomato purée

- Olive oil

- Salt and pepper to taste


**Toppings and garnish:**

- 5-6 small sweet peppers

- 200g cherry tomatoes

- 1 garlic clove

- Juice from half a lime

- 4 eggs

- 50g feta cheese

- A bunch of parsley

- Chives

- Olive oil

- Vegetable oil

- Salt and pepper to taste


**Preparation:**

1. Prepare the veggies for the sauce. Finely dice the onions, mince the garlic and chilli pepper.

2. Start by cooking the onion on some olive oil around 3-4 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and chilli, cook for 2 minutes. Add all your spices, cook for another minute or until fragrant.

3. Pour in the tomato purée, add some sugar and gently simmer for at least 40 minutes. By then it should be pretty thick.

4. Meanwhile, cut the sweet peppers in half, coat with some vegetable oil and roast in the oven for 7 minutes at 220 C. The peppers should be a bit charred but not completely soft.

5. Cut the cherry tomatoes and some of your parsley. Combine with lime juice, salt, pepper, olive oil and 1 clove of garlic (I used a garlic press). Give it at least 20 minutes to marinate.

6. Put some of your sauce at the bottom of an oven-safe pan. Make 4 small wells in the sauce. Add your eggs into the wells. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven and bake in 200 C. I like my eggs quite runny, so I only baked them for around 6 minutes. You can give them more time if youd rather have them more set.

7. Take the pan out of the oven, add your cherry tomatoes and peppers. Garnish with some additional parsley and chives. Crumble some feta cheese on top. Serve with bread (or flatbread).


This amount of sauce should easily make for 2-3 shakshoukas this size.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients**

1 pound chicken breast  
2 tablespoons butter  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
Salt and pepper  
4 cloves garlic, minced  
1 shallot, finely chopped  
8 ounces spinach  
2 large tomatoes, cut into large chunks  
\*or 1 ½ cup of cherry tomatoes  
1 ½ cup mozzarella balls  
1 pound rigatoni pasta  
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  
A few leaves of fresh basil, chiffonaded

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions**

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Season the chicken breast with salt and pepper to taste on both sides. Set aside.
3. In an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, place 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. When hot, carefully place in the chicken breast and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes. Repeat with the other side.
4. When adequately browned, place into the oven to finish cooking for 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Set aside for at least 10 minutes before slicing into thin strips.
5. In the meantime, while the chicken is cooking, bring a large pot of water to boil for the pasta. Heavily salt the water once its boiling.
6. Cook pasta based on instructions--usually 8-10 minutes.
7. In a large pan over medium-low heat, drizzle in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil. When hot, toss in the garlic and shallots and let it cook/infuse for a few minutes until fragrant and softened.
8. Turn the heat up to medium and toss in the tomatoes. Let this cook down for 3-5 minutes and fold in the spinach. Let everything cook together for 2-3 minutes, or until the spinach has wilted. Turn off the heat and add in the chicken.
9. In the same pan or in a large bowl, combine everything with the mozzarella, and toss until the cheese is evenly dispersed and stringy (spago means string in Italian). This may take a minute, but it's worth the extra couple seconds!
10. Feel free to add a little pasta water if you need to thin the sauce out. Garnish with the chiffonaded basil.

From: https://www.thespeltkitchen.com/chocolate-honeycomb-aka-cinder-toffee/


INGREDIENTS

200g white sugar

4 tablespoons golden syrup (see notes)

1 tablespoon bicarbonate (baking soda)

200g milk chocolate


INSTRUCTIONS

Prepare a fairly deep tin/pan by lining it with baking paper.

In a heavy bottomed pan, add the sugar and syrup and heat on a medium temperature until the sugar starts to melt.

Stir often, making sure the mixture doesn't stick, and continue to cook until it changes to a darker brown colour (this should take around 6-8 minutes but watch it carefully because it is very easy to burn).

Remove from the heat and then quickly add the baking soda, whisking it in to the hot mixture, then pour into the prepared pan/tin. Move fast because the sugar mixture starts to harden almost immediately.

Set to one side until it has hardened completely (about 30 minutes).

In the meantime, melt the chocolate and then pour over the hardened honeycomb. Allow the chocolate to set (it doesn't need to be in the fridge unless you are in a hurry).

When ready, break or cut into shards. The pictures in this post show very large pieces for photographic purposes which were broken into smaller pieces before eating.


NOTES

Golden syrup is something commonly used in the UK. Sources tell me that it is available in the US and Canada and can be found in the International aisles (Lyles is the brand). That said, any golden-coloured syrup should work in this recipe.

Some people have reported that the cinder toffee has overflowed. Therefore, make sure you use a fairly deep dish (mine is 5cm in depth).",1687

This time I was curious about pearl barley, so that had to be the base. The result turned out quite fine. So here's what I came up with.

**Ingredients**

* 1/2 cup of pearl barley
* 1 cup of water
* 1/2 cup diced mushrooms
* 2 branches of thyme
* 1/4th of a medium sized onion
* 1 garlic clove
* 4 table spoons of olive oil
* a little salt

**Directions**

1. Wash the pearl barley, let the wet barley rest of a bit while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
2. Dice the carrot, dice the mushrooms
3. Heat the water, add a little bit of salt. Once the water boils, add the barley and the diced carrot. Let it boil on low heat for about 45 minutes. If the barley should soak up all water, add a little more each time.
4. Dice the onion finely, also the garlic.
5. Heat the oil in a small pot. Add the diced mushrooms, onion and garlic.
6. Fry the mushrooms till they get some tan. Then add the thyme branches and put a lid on the pot. Fry for 5 to 10 minutes more. Don't burn the mushrooms but fry them well, this will develop flavor. Keep the heat low all the time.

Once done, place the barley and carrot bedding on the plate, add the fried mushrooms on top. Voila!

Recipe link: [https://www.theflouredcamera.com/korean-rice-paper-tteokbokki/](https://www.theflouredcamera.com/korean-rice-paper-tteokbokki/) 

# Ingredients

* 8 pieces rice paper
* 2 tbsp Korean red chili paste (gochujang)
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp granulated sugar
* 1 tsp Korean red chili pepper powder (gochugaru)
* 1 tbsp minced garlic
* 2 cups chicken broth (sub with anchovy stock or water)
* ½ white onion
* 3 sheets fish cake (sliced)
* 1 packet instant ramen
* 2 stalks scallion
* 1 tbsp white sesame seeds
* 1 hard-boiled egg (optional)  


**Cornstarch Slurry**

* 1 tbsp cornstarch
* 2 tbsp water  


# Instructions

1. Mix minced garlic, soy sauce, granulated sugar, Korean red chili pepper powder and Korean red chili paste in a bowl to make a paste.
2. To prep the rice paper, dip in lukewarm water for 2 seconds. Place on a non-stick surface and roll from the bottom to the top as tightly as you can. The rice paper will continue to soften.
3. Repeat for each piece of rice paper. Use a wet knife and slice each roll into 3-4 pieces, around 2 inches long each.
4. Heat up stock or water in a deep pan and add the spicy paste. Bring to a medium boil.
5. Add in onions and let boil for 30 seconds.
6. Add in fish cakes and rice paper rolls and cook for about 2-3 minutes. To thicken, add the cornstarch slurry. Stir frequently.
7. Add the ramen noodles and cook according to package instructions.
8. Taste the spicy sauce and adjust the seasoning to your liking (e.g., sugar for more sweetness or gochugaru for more spiciness). Add another ½ cup of broth or water, if necessary. The sauce should have a similar thickness to a creamy soup.
9. Finally, add in scallions and let simmer for another 20 seconds.

**Ingredients**

4 cups cooked rice (about 1 ½ cups dried to 2 cups water)  
1 tablespoon rice vinegar  
1 6oz can of tuna  
2 tablespoons mayonnaise  
1 teaspoon sriracha sauce  
1 tablespoon minced pickle  
1 tablespoon minced onion  
½ teaspoon lemon juice  
¼ teaspoon grated garlic  
1 teaspoon sesame seeds

  
**Directions**

1. Cook the rice based on package instructions. The brand I use calls for 1 ½ cups of dry rice to 2 cups of water. Season with one tablespoon of rice vinegar.  
2. In a small bowl, combine the tuna, mayonnaise, sriracha, pickle, onion, and garlic. Set aside.  
3. To make the onigiri, you can use your hands, or a plastic mold if you have one. Be sure to have a bowl of water to rinse your hands in between making onigiri. You can portion the rice into ¼ cup sections, or simply eyeball it.  
4. With wet hands, grab a handful of rice and pat it down until it's evenly dispersed across your hand. Place 1-2 tablespoons of filling in the middle and fold the rice over the filling. If it doesnt fully cover it, top it with a little more rice. Then, begin forming the ball into a nice, flat, hockey-puck-shaped disk. The flatter you can make it, the more crispy texture from pan-frying in butter.  
5. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat step 4 for the other onigiri.  
6. Once everything has been nicely formed, heat up a large pan over medium-low heat. When hot, place in the onigiri and cook until browned, about 2-3 minutes on each side.  
7. When the onigiri are toasted to perfection, they are ready. Set aside to cool for a few minutes and enjoy!",1758

This is perfect for winter, enjoy it!

**Ingredients**

* 1 large roughly chopped white or yellow onion 
* 1 large carrot sliced into 1/2-inch-thick medallions
* 10 cloves finely minced garlic, separated into two equal piles
* 10-20 small pearl onions
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley, divided for garnish and recipe (1 tbsp respectively)
* 1 pound fresh or dried white or brown mushrooms (cut into quarters if fresh)
* 2 bay leaves
* Olive oil
* 1/2 pounds bacon, each slice roughly chopped in half into squares
* 4 pounds venison, cut into 2-inch chunks (any roasting cut is good, I've used anything from scraps to a whole venison hind-leg on the bone).
* Salt and freshly ground pepper
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 3 cups drinkable dry red wine (pinot noir, merlot, or chianti)
* 2 cups beef stock/bone broth
* 2 tablespoons butter

**Note:** Makes roughly 4-6 servings.

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 350ºF.
2. Put your oven-safe stock pot or Dutch oven on your stovetop and fry the bacon in olive oil until slightly browned. Make sure to keep temperatures relatively low so as to not burn the bottom of your pot. Set the bacon aside.
3. Salt and pepper the venison, then sear it on all sides in the fat/oil from the bacon. Add to the plate/container where you've put your bacon.
4. Add carrots and onions to the pot, then fry in the oil/fat from earlier until soft (add more oil if vegetables are sticking to the bottom of the pot). Add half the garlic, fry for 1 minute, then add the bacon and venison back in. Stir in flour, salt, and pepper.
5. Add wine, and scrape the fond that's built up on the bottom of the pot. Add the stock/bone broth, tomato paste, and herbs (withholding 1 tbsp parsley for garnish). Stir to combine, cover, and place in the oven for 2-4 hours or until the meat is fork tender. If liquids have evaporated midway and you're in danger of burning, add more stock/bone broth.
6. Bring a small pot of water to a boil, cut the ends off one side of your pearl onions (this will help in removing skins), then toss them into the pot for 2-3 minutes uncovered. Remove from the water, and once they are cool enough to touch you should be able to just squeeze the onion skins off. Reserve in a bowl for later.
7. Place a colander over a bowl and pour the venison and liquid through this. Take the resulting liquid and bring to a gentle simmer on your stove top. Separate the meat from the vegetables. Discard any bones. Separating the vegetables from the meat and sauce allows you to creative a very rich and professional-looking dish, so I do believe it to be an important step. I like to save the cooked-down vegetables to add to leftover stew the next day.
8. Once the simmering liquid has reached a consistency thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, its ready. If its not getting there properly, or you're in a rush, you can fork together a 50/50 mixture of 1 tbsp butter and flour. Mix this into the liquid and you will notice it thickens quite well. If its too thick, mix in some more bone broth or stock.
9. While the sauce is reducing, fry the mushrooms in butter. Do not move the mushrooms excessively, as this causes them to bleed liquid and lose the crust they develop. In the last minute or so of mushroom-cooking add the reserved garlic and a dash of parsley. When the garlic is golden, remove from heat and reserve.
10. Your bourguignon is now ready. Serve with mashed potatoes (rice or butter noodles are also acceptable substitutes). You can mix your meat, mushrooms, and pearl onions into your finished sauce before servingor you can go fancy and place your meat on a bed of mashed potatoes, dot with pearl onions and mushrooms, and then coat in your sauce. Garnish with parsley, and enjoy!",4049

*INGREDIENTS FOR 12-16 BARS*

Base layer:

\- Graham wafer crumbs or, alternatively, digestive biscuits \[1.75 cups / 180 g\]

\- coconut flakes \[1 cup / 75 g\]

\- finely chopped almonds \[1/2 cup / 50 g\]

\- unsalted butter \[1/2 cup / 110 g\]

\- fine/caster sugar \[1/4 cup / 45 g\]

\- cocoa powder \[5 tbsp / 30 g\]

\- 1 fresh egg

Custard icing layer:

\- unsalted butter \[1/2 cup / 110 g\]

\- heavy cream \[3 tbsp / 50 ml\]

\- Bird's custard powder \[2 tbsp / 25 g\]

\- icing sugar \[2 cups / 200 g\]

Coating:

\- unsalted butter \[2 tbsp / 30 g\]

\- semi-sweet chocolate \[4 oz / 120 g\]

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. For the 1st layer: Pulverize crackers, if you can't find Graham wafer crumbs, and - in a big enough bowl - mix those with the finely shredded coconut flakes as well as almonds and set aside
2. Melt butter in a double boiler (""bain-marie""). Whisk in sugar and cacao till well combined, before adding a beaten egg.  When adding the egg, make sure that you're simultaneously whisking the mass, in order for the egg to be incorporated fast. Otherwise you'll end up with junks of scrambled eggs. Continue whisking for a few minutes, till all ingredients unite and the mass thickens
3. Combine ingredients from steps 1 &amp; 2 and distribute over your 8x8 inch / 20x20 cm form. Evenly spread and press it with your spatula to a firm mass, leaving no space in between
4. For the 2nd layer: In a clean bowl, drop the warm butter, and unite it with the cream, custard powder and icing sugar. Once you get an even mass, you gotta grab your whisk and fluff it up! This took me 10-15 minutes, but if you have a proper electric whisk, you'll get there sooner 
5. Now spread that custard icing over the 1st layer of almond-coco-cracker
6. For the 3rd layer, combine the butter an chocolate in the double boiler till fully emulsified, which shouldn't take too long
7. Before pouring it over the 2nd layer, let cool down a bit, till not hot anymore, but still liquid. Evenly spread the chocolate, but be very careful and don't press it into the custard layer. I elevated the form and changed the angle and let the chocolate run all over. It worked out alright
8. Cover the form with plastic wrap and let chill in your fridge for at least 3 hours, before serving! I noticed that it tasted better, when kept in fridge overnight
9. Enjoy!

2021-10-05,58,"Scotch Eggs","EminusVulneratis","Certainly not the quickest recipe, and to be honest not as good as you can get buying from people that make them for a living, but as a British expat this is as close as I can get.

Recipe lightly modified from here: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/scotcheggs\_85851](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/scotcheggs_85851)

**Ingredients:**

For the sausage meat:

\- 1lb lean minced pork

\- 20g Stuffing Mix (Bland as possible so American style preferably. I used Stove Top pork)- Freshly ground Pepper

\- 2 tsp fresh thyme

\- 1 tsp parsley flakes

\- 1 tsp sage

\- 2 small shallots, very finely chopped

&amp;#x200B;

For the scotch eggs:

\- 6 medium eggs

\- 80g plain flower, seasoned with salt and pepper

\- 1 egg beaten

\- 3 slices of white bread, lightly toasted then ground into breadcrumbs

\- vegetable oil, for frying

&amp;#x200B;

**Method**

\- Combine all the ingredients for the sausage meat together in a medium bowl, mix thoroughly. Meat can be covered and stored in fridge for later use.

\- Place the eggs, unbroken, in cold salted water. Bring to the boil then immediately reduce tempreature and simmer for 9 min. (You may have to do this in stages, if so you only need to let the water cool to warm between batches)

\- When the eggs are finished strain and cool under running water. Then peel off the shells, if you haven't done this before I recommend looking up a video, fingernails help.

\- Take the sausage meet and divide into sixths on a clean cutting board, before flattening each into a shallow oval \~1/4"" thick.

\- Spread the seasoned flower onto a large plate. One at a time take a peeled egg and dredge it in flower until a thin coating sticks to all surfaces, before placing the egg at the center of the flattened sausage meat, and wrapping the meat around it and gently rolling to form a smooth egg shaped ball.

\- Prepare the breadcrumbs, I used a stick blender and a tall cup to get them fine enough. Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate. One at a time coat the meat wrapped eggs in the beaten egg mixture before rolling in bread crumbs enough to ensure a even coating on all surfaces.

\- With all the eggs prepared select a high walled pot and fill with oil, quantity will vary based on pot selection but ideally should be enough to completely submerge the prepared egg. **Important:** Do not fill the pot anywhere near to full, remember when you place eggs in the oil level will rise and we do not want it to boil over. Heat the oil until a loose breadcrumb placed in it will bubble and brown in around 30s. (I found this was around 370F)

\- The eggs will be cooked for \~9 min in the hot oil. I suggest using a slotted spoon to place and remove them. I encourage you to monitor the oil tempreature yourself, either by thermometer or look and feel and suggest you open up the first egg cooked and determine if any adjustments need to be made. It will all be relative to your setup but I cooked the eggs two at a time on alternating cycles, one egg removed every four and a half minutes, my oil temperature remained fairly constant at \~320F, and I rotated the eggs twice to ensure even cooking.

\- **Important:** Usual safety precautions when working with hot oil apply, always use long implements to place eggs into the oil preferably from the side of the pot. Be aware of the temperament of the oil, sizzling is good bubbling is worrying. Be aware of the level of the oil as you add and remove the eggs. Finally as I was working in a small pot I took the step of turning off the gas every time I added a egg to prevent risk of flare up if the oil overflowed.

\- When the eggs are finished place them on a sheet of kitchen roll to absorb excess oil. Personal preference is to serve chilled or at room temperature, though they can be eaten warm after allowing some time to cool.  


  
**Improvements**  
This is probably the simplest least creative recipe for scotch eggs out there, I was deliberately aiming for generic. It does however make it completely open to adaptation/improvement. If I were to make it again I would definitely attempt to address the slightly bland breadcrumbs, I suspect the answer may be more salt but I also want to see if some herbs (perhaps sage) add some complexity to the flavor.",4265

3. Strain, then add the broth, cilantro, peanuts, and 1 fresh garlic clove. Blend and reduce until thickened.
4. For the filling: finely chop the onion, garlic and pepper. Remove the corn kernels from the cob.

2021-10-03,18,"Korean Kimchi","mienczaczek","Check out my simple recipe for delicious Korean fermented cabbage.

As a Polish guy, I was raised on sauerkraut and sour pickled cucumbers, as an adult, I fell in love with Kimchi and now it plays an important part in my daily diet.

Fermentation is a magical process that transforms food giving it a more complex flavour, improved nutritional value and significantly benefits your gut microbiome.

Personally, I am fascinated with the procedure and to create this recipe I worked with a few different batches and ingredients, here are a few insights that I came up with that may work for you while preparing your own Kimchi:

You don't need loads of exotic ingredients to prepare Kimchi.

You could ferment the Nappa cabbage only by using Gochujang paste and salt, use Gochugaru chilli powder instead of the paste, or you can also skip the rice porridge part altogether. The ingredients that I use in the recipe give great results, even without radish or shrimp paste. Once you learn the process, play with different ratios and ingredients yourself, have fun!

&amp;#x200B;

Preparation time: 2-4 hours

Fermentation time: 3 days

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients, First Part:**

2 Nappa Cabbages medium size (Chinese Leaf)

4tsp of salt (around 20g)

1 small carrot, peeled and cut into small sticks

2 spring onions, washed and sliced

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients, Second Part:**

8 garlic cloves, minced

2tsp of minced ginger

1 medium onion, minced or fine dice

3tbsp of Gochujang Paste or Gochugaru chilli powder

1/2tbsp of glutinous rice flour

1/2tbsp of sugar

100ml of water

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

1.Begin by preparing Nappa cabbages, cut in half and remove leaves from the core, place them in a big bowl or plastic container and gently mix with the salt. Leave for 2-4 hours mixing with your clean hands occasionally (salt draws moisture out of the leaves creating space for the flavour and makes them softer).

2.In the meantime prepare rice porridge, in a small pot mix 1/2tbsp of rice flour with 100ml of water and bring to simmer, cook for 5-8 minutes whisking occasionally to prevent lumps. Once it thickens add 1/2tbsp of sugar, mix and remove from the stove.

3.Transfer porridge to the bowl and mix with minced garlic, ginger, onion and Gochujang paste, give it a taste, add more paste for more spice to your preference.

4.You can add carrot sticks and chopped green onions to the chilli paste mix and leave it like that until cabbage is ready for another step.

5.Once the cabbage is softened, gently mix it with the chilli paste and veg and place in the clean 3L jar with rubber seal (slightly bigger jar makes it easier to maintain as cabbage expands during fermentation, you can also use two smaller jars instead)

6.Once the jar is filled, place a small piece of plastic film on the top of the cabbage to create a protective layer, close the jar and leave it in the dark spot/room temperature for 24 hours.

7.On the following day open the jar and press the cling film layer with a clean hand and close the jar (this helps to keep all the cabbage under liquid and releases some of the CO2 builds up) Repeat this step after another 24 hours.

8.After 72 hours (3 days) press your kimchi one more time and remove the cling film. Kimchi is ready to eat at this point, keep it in the fridge from now on, the flavour will develop with time making it even better!

INGREDIENTS:

* 2 and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon white granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 sticks (1 cup unsalted butter) cold, cut in cubes
* 2 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* 4 tablespoon ice-cold water

&amp;#x200B;

DIRECTIONS:

* Using a food processor or a mixing bowl, mix the flour with salt and sugar.
* Add the cold butter and if you are using a food processor then pulse it a few times to incorporate the butter to the flour. If you are using a mixing bowl, then cut the butter using a pastry cutter or fork, or you could even grate the cold butter to the flour.
* Pour the vinegar and ice-cold water, then pulse it once again to bring the mixture together. If you are using a mixing bowl, then use a wooden spoon to bring the dough together.
* Then transfer the dough to a bigger space, chopping board or kitchen counter. DO NOT KNEAD. Just bring the dough together and divide into two portions.
* Wrap each portion using a clear wrap and then flatten it out a little, so it becomes easy to roll later.Keep the wrap dough in the fridge to make it cold again, before you roll. You can store the pie crust in the refrigerator for 3 days and in the freezer for 3 months.
* When you are ready to roll the pie crust, dust enough flour on the board and on the rolling pin. Then roll it gently from center to outward and rotate the dough now and then. You have to roll it to 1/8th inch thick and 1 inch wider than the pie plate.
* Wrap the rolled dough to your rolling pin and transfer it to the pie plate. Do not press the dough down to the pie plate. Push the edges down to fill the bottom with the pie plate.
* Trim off the excess dough, and if you like a thicker crust, then tug the edges to make it thicker. (WATCH THE VIDEO)
* Finally, shape the edge as per your liking.
* Place the prepared pie pan in the fridge for 15 minutes, before you fill and bake.
* If you are blind baking the pie crust, then place a crumbled parchment paper to the crust and pour enough dried beans or lentils and press it down gently to spread it evenly.
* Bake the pie crust for 10 minutes.
* Remove the lentil and the parchment paper, and bake for another 5 minutes. The pie crust is partially baked and ready for the filling.
* For the excess trimmed off pie dough, you can roll it out and use the fall leaves cookie cutter to make decoration for your pie.",2601

The mussel season just started in Europe and we took a chance on making Moules Frites at home. Turns out, it's not as difficult as thought, but tastes better than anticipated, for I usually am not a big fan of mussels.

**Enjoy the recipe and** [**United Cuisines on YouTube!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxzYaCMICGw)

INGREDIENTS:

*Classic Belgian mussels*

\- 1 onion

\- fresh mussels \[3 lb / 1.4 kg\]

\- butter \[2.5 oz / 70 g\]

\- 1 branch of celery

\- ground black pepper \[1/2 tbsp / 5 g\]

\- pinch of salt

\- a handful of parsley (optional)

*Crispy Belgian fries*

\- mealy, high-starch potatoes, such as Bintje \[1 lb / 450 g\]

\- rendered beef fat/tallow \[1.1 lb / 500 g\]

Servings: 2

INSTRUCTIONS

*Belgian mosselen natuur*

1. Wash and clean mussels in cold water. Remove their beards/fibers, place them in a bowl with water and set aside. INFO: Fresh mussels are still alive and should be closed. Tap them against each other, when open and they should close. If not, discard them, together with those whose shells are broken
2. Dice onions and celery. Chop parsley
3. Use (enamel) pots with handles and high sides. Place over medium heat, melt the butter and sauté the diced onion and celery for around 5 minutes
4. Mix in the ground black pepper and increase the heat to high
5. Grab as many mussels as you can by hand and quickly transfer them into the pot. Dont fully drain the water!
6. Give your mussels a good mix, distributing the veggies among them, put on the lid and let cook over for 7 minutes. The mussels closest to the pots bottom, will open up and cook first. Hence, its important that you mix your mussels by shaking the pot without opening its lid. Do this 3x in those 7 minutes of cooking
7. The mussels should have all opened up and be cooked by now. Turn off the heat, mix in the parsley and keep the lid on, whilst we prepare your Belgian fries of your Moules Frites! INFO: Dont eat mussels that didnt open. Discard them!

*Belgian fries* 

1. Wash and peel the potatoes, before cutting them into 11-12mm \[0.45 inch\] thick fries. Transfer into a cold water bath and let soak for 30 minutes
2. Drain the fries, spread them over a baking sheet, that you covered with some kitchen towels and properly dab your potatoes dry. INFO: Belgian fries shall be fried twice: once on low and once on high temperature.
3. Place the beef tallow into a deep pot and let melt over medium-high heat
4. Once the oil temperature hits 140°C \[280°F\], drop the first batch of fries in there. Dont overcrowd the pot and mix well right away. Let fry for 5 minutes
5. The surface of your fries will turn a bit white-ish in color: those are burst starch granules that start to gelatinize. Now its time to get them out of the hot oil, drain and place them on paper towels on your baking sheet, where they shall cool down for 20 minutes. Fry the other batches while you wait, or take the pot off the heat
6. Once fries cooled down, bring up the oils temperature up to around 190°C \[370°F\], put one pre-fried batch in, and immediately give them a short stir. Fry for 3-5 minutes, till the potatoes start to slightly float and golden in color
7. When the potatoes are done, drain and transfer them into a bowl, covered with kitchen paper and immediately salt before mixing them
8. Enjoy! Bon appétit and eet smakelijk \[French and Dutch are spoken in Belgium\]

2021-09-30,25,"Secret Ingredient Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins","yellowjacquet","The ""secret ingredient"" is coconut oil. Coconut oil is special because its melting point is just above room temperature, which helps give the muffins a melt-in-your-mouth texture. After this discovery I started using coconut oil in ALL of my similar muffins and breads! I tried out so so many pumpkin muffin variations before settling on this as the favorite, I really think the coconut oil is what makes them amazing!

Theres a few other little things that are important as well - one is the mini chocolate chips. The mini chips work much better than full size chips because they allow the chocolate to spread out more evenly through the muffin. I also like to use salted raw pumpkin seeds on top which is an awesome additions if you are a sweet &amp; salty lover. Like most baked goods, not over baking the muffins makes a huge difference. Because of this I like to check the muffins frequently for doneness at the end.

These muffins also freeze and reheat great, so I pretty much always have some on hand for a quick breakfast!

# Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins

**Makes: 12 muffins**

# Ingredients

* 1 ¾ cups flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 ½ tbsp pumpkin pie spice
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* ½ cup dark brown sugar
* 1 ½ tsp vanilla extract
* 2 eggs
* 1 (15 oz) can unflavored pumpkin puree
* ½ cup coconut oil, melted
* S cup + 2 tbsp mini semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips, divided
* 2 tbsp raw shelled pumpkin seeds

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375° F, place 12 liners into a standard size muffin pan (or \~36 for mini muffins). 
2. In a medium bowl combine the flour, white sugar, salt, baking soda, and pumpkin pie spice.  Set aside. 
3. In a large bowl combine the eggs, melted coconut oil, vanilla, pumpkin puree, and dark brown sugar. 
4. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix until just combined (do not overmix the batter). 
5. Mix in S cup mini chocolate chips. 
6. Portion the batter into the prepared muffin pan, fill the muffin liners all the way to the brim. Sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips and the pumpkin seeds on top. 
7. Place the muffins in the oven and set a timer for 18 minutes. Check one of the center muffins at 18 minutes by inserting a toothpick. If the toothpick does not come out clean, place the muffins back in the oven and re-check them every 2 minutes until they are done. For mini muffins check for doneness at 10 minutes. (This ensures that the muffins are not overbaked, which makes a huge difference in the final quality/texture).

**To Freeze -** Freeze on a cookie sheet or plate so that they are not touching, once frozen transfer to a zip bag for long term storage. Reheat for \~30 seconds in the microwave.

2021-09-29,7,"Morel Mushroom ""Dumpling"" Recipe","cookingwithRobin","Morel mushrooms have a rich earthy and nutty taste in addition to its mushroom flavor. They have a honeycomb appearance and the inside is hollow. The basic methods for cooking morels are to add them in soup or sauté them with butter. The most delicious way of cooking morels that I've found is to stuff them with a little bit of meat and steam them. The juicy meat filling will make the morels extra delicious! Imagine you are eating your favorite dumplings with a Shiitake mushroom wrapper!

&amp;#x200B;

[A video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/T9tNv703GWM)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

\- 80g ground beef (80% lean and 20% fat)

\- 8 Morel mushrooms

\- 2 cloves of garlic

\- 2 dried chilis

&amp;#x200B;

Marinade:

\- 2 tsps soy sauce

\- 1 tsp (5ml) Chinese cooking wine

\- 1 tbsp (15ml) water or chicken stock

\- 1g salt

\- A pinch of black pepper

\- 1/2 tsp oil

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. To prepare the morels, clean them with cold water. Because I am using dried morels, I followed the instructions on the packaging and soaked them in warm water for half an hour. Dont throw away the water, we will use it to make a gravy later.
2. Cut off the morel stems for later use. Season the meat lightly and then stuff morels with the filling.
3. Bring the water to a rolling boil and steam the morels for about 8 minutes.
4. Sauté the morel stems with garlic and dried chilis for about 3-4 minutes using medium heat. Place them on a plate.
5. Add about 4 ounces of the mushroom water and a pinch of salt. Dont forget to add the morel juice from the steamer. Add 1 tbsp starch water to thicken the liquid. Keep stirring until you get the gravy consistency as you like.
6. Boil some noodles and we are ready to eat!

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

If you dont know what morel mushrooms taste like, think of them like shiitake mushrooms which might be easier to find in stores. Their flavors are somewhat comparable. The Morel mushrooms have a more earthy and nutty flavor, and that makes it taste richer and more mellow than shiitake mushrooms. They are less fragrant than shiitake mushrooms when you make them into a soup. Thats why I like the steaming method because it naturally reserves the mushroom juice as well as its bouncy and meaty texture.",2299

TIPS:  
\- If your dough is too soft to be worked with at any point, place it in the freeze for \~10 minutes before continuing, this helps to set it, although you must work quickly as it becomes soft very fast. 

  
\- Oranges contain natural pectin, if you don't have pectin I suggest to use the peels of the oranges themselves (look up how on the internet). However pectin makes the it really easy to make any sort of jams, so i highly recommend to buy it from the store.

  
\- You can make dehydrated/candied Orange slices by placing slices into the oven for around 2-4 hours at around 100°C. Lovely for decoration.

  
\- You can definitely use a normal baking pan for this recipe. However, the perforated ring helps to make it look super professional. If you plan on using a normal baking pan, I suggest the blind bake method

RECIPE VIDEO LINK - [https://youtu.be/KdF86Mcct1Y](https://youtu.be/KdF86Mcct1Y)

INGREDIENTS: 

1.5 lb chicken (I used with skinless chicken pieces with bones in)  
15 cloves of garlic  
1 inch fresh ginger  
½ cup thick plain yogurt   
2 teaspoons salt   
½ teaspoon sugar  
1 medium size red onion  
1 teaspoon turmeric powder  
1 teaspoon cumin powder   
1/2 teaspoon coriander powder  
1/2 teaspoon chili powder   
2 tablespoon oil  
1 green chili  
1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder   
¼ cup finely chopped cilantro leaves

DIRECTIONS: 

You will use 10 garlic cloves to marinate the chicken. The other 5 will be used while cooking the curry. Grate or pound 10 garlic cloves along with ginger. Slice thinly, the remaining 5 garlic cloves  
   
If you are using chicken drumsticks, make sure to score the meat portion a couple of times.   
In a bowl add the chicken pieces along with yogurt, pounded garlic, ½ teaspoon turmeric and 1 teaspoon salt. Give it a mix nicely to coat all the chicken pieces. Keep it aside for minimum 4 hrs or overnight for maximum flavor blend.   
When you are ready to prepare the chicken curry, place a heavy bottom nonstick pan on the stove at medium heat. Pour the oil along with the sliced garlic, chopped green chili and chopped ginger. As the oil heats up, the garlic will start to sizzle and slowly turn golden brown. Take out some garlic chips to add later in garnish.   
To the wok add the sliced onion. Sprinkle the rest of the salt, sugar and turmeric along with the spices (cumin powder, coriander powder and chili powder). Stir and cook the onion for 3 minutes, or until its golden brown.   
Then add the marinated chicken and stir it to incorporate everything. If you are using boneless chicken cubes, it will take 15minutes to cook the chicken. If you use chicken with bones in, then it will take about 20 minutes.   
After 10 minutes of cooking the chicken, it will start to release water. Now depending on how much gravy you want, add water and let it continue cooking.   
Once the chicken is cooked, taste for salt and add any if needed.   
Finally sprinkle finely chopped cilantro leaves, garam masala powder and give it a mix.",2320

Cake: 

Ingredients

- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (94 g)

- 1/2 tsp baking powder

- 1/2 tsp baking soda

- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

- 1/4 tsp nutmeg

- 1/4 tsp salt

- 3 large eggs

- 1 cup granulated sugar (200 g)

- 2/3 cup pumpkin puree (150 g)

- 2 tsp vanilla extract

Directions

1) Pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 10 by 15 inch (25 by 38 cm) jelly roll pan and lay a piece of parchment on it. Grease the parchment so the cake does not stick to it.

2) In a large bowl, sift together your flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Then whisk to incorporate.

3) In a separate bowl, combine your eggs and sugar. Beat with your mixer on high until mixture becomes pale yellow and thick (about 2 minutes).

4) Beat in your pumpkin purée and vanilla extract until incorporated.

5) Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, gently fold in your flour mixture until just combined.

6) Pour your batter into your parchment-lined baking pan. Use a rubber or offset spatula to smooth out the batter into each edge and corner of the pan.

7) Bake for 11-15 minutes. You know the cake is done when the center of the cake springs back when gently pressed. Avoid over-baking the cake because this can lead to cracking when trying to roll it.

8) After your cake comes out of the oven, loosen the edges with a knife or offset spatula. Then take another baking pan of equal or larger size and line it with parchment. Invert this pan so the parchment is now lying underneath and place them on top of your sheet of cake. Holding the cake between the two baking pans, carefully flip the entire thing upside-down and peel back the original layer of parchment. Taking one of the shorter ends, roll up the cake while it is still warm in the new layer of parchment and let cool completely while you work on the frosting.

Frosting:

Ingredients

- 1 package of cream cheese, softened (about 8 oz or 226 g)

- 1/2 cup unsalted butter (113 g)

- 1 cup powdered sugar (130 g)

- 1 tsp vanilla extract

- Pinch of salt

Directions

1) In a medium saucepan, cook butter over medium heat until melted and browned, stirring constantly. It should take about 4 minutes. You will see it change color and aroma with brown bits forming at the bottom. Take off the heat and transfer to a bowl. Let the browned butter cool in the fridge until it is no longer liquid but still soft (about 30 minutes).

2) With your mixer on high, beat together your softened cream cheese and browned butter until smooth, about 2 minutes.

3) Add in your powdered sugar and beat on low until smooth and combined. (If your frosting looks too thin or loose, add in more sugar a little bit at a time.)

4) Lastly, beat in your vanilla and salt. Stick your frosting in the fridge while you candy the walnuts.

Candied Walnuts: 

Ingredients

- 1/2 cup sugar (100 g)

- 1/4 cup water (59 ml)

- Pinch of salt

- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (56 g)

Directions

1) Line a baking sheet with parchment.

2) Place sugar, water, and salt into a medium sauce pan. Stir to combine. Then turn heat on to medium.

3) Allow the mixture to come to a boil.

4) Once at a boil, add in your walnuts and allow them to coat in the sugar syrup until the sugar turns golden-brown.

5) Turn off the heat and using two forks, carefully take out the walnut pieces, a few at a time and lay them on the parchment-lined sheet. Use the forks to break up any large clusters of nuts so they can cool down individually, rather than stay as large clumps.

6) Once the nuts have cooled down and the coating has set, you are ready to assemble.

Assembly: 

1) Unroll your completely cooled pumpkin cake.

2) Spread your cream cheese frosting in an even layer across the top of the cake, leaving a small border all around the edges.

3) Sprinkle your candied walnuts pieces on top of the layer of cream cheese frosting. Try to get it as evenly dispersed as possible.

4) Roll the cake back up as you peel back the parchment. You should end with the cake lying seam-side down.

5) Let chill in the fridge for at least 20 minutes to allow the cake to set before slicing. Before serving, dust with powdered sugar and trim off the end pieces of the cake with a sharp knife to expose the beautiful swirl inside.",4406

**Ingredients:**

160 g Pitted Dates

120 ml Hot Tea

1 cup Whole Wheat flour

1 cup All -Purpose Flour

2 tsp baking powder

1/2 tsp sea salt

3/4 cups cold unsalted butter

1 egg

2 tsp vanilla extract

1/2 cup almond milk

1 egg

Powdered Monk Fruit Sweetener for topping (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

**Recipe:**

Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit 

Chop or grind dates and pour hot tea over them. Let them sit for 5 minutes.

Sift flours, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Rub the butter quickly and lightly into flour with fingers until the consistency of bread crumbs. 

Drain dates  and discard the liquid. Mix in dates using fingers

Beat egg, vanilla and almond milk together in a small town. Gradually pour egg mixture into the flour mixture a bit at  time. Dough should be wet and sticky but still hold form. Set aside extra egg mixture. 

Dust contour with flour and flatten dough using hands into a rectangle about 2.5cm/1in thick and 6cm/2.5in wide. 

For American-style scones, cut the dough in quarters, and then on a reverse diagonal, cut into eights. Pick up each one, and quickly dust each side so scone is completely dusted. 

Put scones on baking sheet spaced at least 2.5cm/1in apart, as thy will spread when baked. Quickly brush the scones with the remaining egg mixture. 

Bake 14-20 minutes in the preheated open until rise and golden. Dust with powdered monk fruit sweetener with a sifter or eat as is or with butter.

I think they turned out good. Tho, I would put less dates in it if I make date scones again. Maybe 100 grams instead.",1698

2021-09-24,7,"Blackcurrant Bakewell Tart","markandana_pantree","Bakewell Tarts aren't traditionally made with blackcurrant jam, but we found it works *so* well because the jam has such a zing to it. Obviously the pastry could be shop-bought to simplify things if wanted!

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients**  
*For the pastry:*  
\- 300g plain white flour  
\- 30g white sugar  
\- 1/2 teaspoon fine salt  
\- 200g cold unsalted butter  
\- 1 egg yolk  
\- 3 tablespoons cold water (the colder, the better)  


*For the filling:*  
\- 1 jar blissfully blackcurrant jam  
\- 130g ground almonds  
\- 30g plain white flour  
\- 100g caster sugar  
\- 110g unsalted butter at room temperature  
\- 2 eggs  
\- 1 teaspoon almond extract  
   
  
**Method**  
  
1. For the pastry, start by adding the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor. Cut the cold butter (it needs to be cold and firm) into medium cubes (approximately 1x1 inch) and distrbute the cubes on top of the dry ingredients. Pulse 16 times.  
  
2. Turn off the food processor, add the egg yolk and turn it back on its lowest setting. While it is running, add 2-3 tablespoons of water and process for up to 10 seconds, just enough to combine. The pastry should still be quite crumbly after these steps.  
  
3. Turn the pastry onto a flat clean surface and, working it as little as possible, form it into a ball. Cover it tightly and put it in the fridge for 1 hour.  
  
4. Pre-heat the oven to 180C/160C Fan. Once the pastry has cooled, dust a flat surface with flour and roll out the dough medium-thin, or to the thickness of your liking, into a circle. Roll it up in a rolling pin and unfold it on a tart case. Use excess trimmings to fill up any gaps or holes (tip: use a small piece of dough as a tool to press the pastry against the case, ensuring it is well fit). Leave the overhangings for now, i.e. do not trim the edges, but do save a bit of dough in case you need to fill any holes later.   
  
5. Using a fork, make several holes throughout the bottom of the pastry. Place a piece of greaseproof baking paper on top of the tart case and top it with baking beans, rice or any other grain to weigh it down. Bake for 15-20mins.  
  
6. Remove the case from the oven, remove the baking paper and beans and bake it for another 5 minutes. Remove it from the oven and, while the pastry is still hot, use a serrated knife to carefully go around the edges of the case and trim them. Leave your knife as flat as possible for a smooth cut. Trimming the pastry at this stage rather than earlier reduces shrinkage.  
  
7. Set the pastry aside. For the filling, beat together the butter and sugar using an electric mixer for approximately 5 minutes, until light and fluffy.  
  
8. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well in between, and finally add the almond extract, beating once again to incorporate.  
  
9. Delicately fold in the ground almonds and flour, just until combined. Do not overmix or use an electric mixer for this stage.  
  
10. Line the tart case with a full jar of Blissfully Blackcurrant Jam, and delicately add the frangipane filling on top, using the back of a spoon to carefully spread it throughout the tart.  
  
11. Bake for 35-40mins until the frangipane has set. Let the tart cool fully before removing it from the case. Serve with creme fraiche, and be happy.

2021-09-23,20,"Korean Fried Chicken Tacos","parisrosaries","Huge huge fan of Korean fried chicken, and I use to go to a Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant that did a great KFC bowl. Thought I'd try it in tacos with some homemade Korean coleslaw and kimchi.

Full recipe: [https://www.theflouredcamera.com/korean-fried-chicken-tacos/](https://www.theflouredcamera.com/korean-fried-chicken-tacos/)

# Ingredients

* 1 lb chicken thigh, cubed
* 2 tbsp rice wine or Shaoxing wine
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* ½ inch ginger, minced
* ¼ tsp salt
* Pepper, to taste
* Neutral oil, fill pot for frying  


**Sauce**

* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp rice vinegar
* 1½ tbsp *gochujang*
* 3 tbsp honey
* 2 tsp sesame oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* ½ inch ginger, minced  


**To assemble**

* 6 corn tortillas, sub flour tortillas
* 1 cup Korean coleslaw
* ½ cup kimchi, cut in bite-sized pieces
* Lime
* White sesame seeds, optional
* Kewpie mayo, optional  


# Instructions

1. Make your slaw first and let it sit in the fridge for two hours. Follow my Korean coleslaw recipe.
2. Slice chicken thigh into bite-sized pieces. Marinade in rice wine, salt, pepper, garlic, and ginger for 30 minutes.
3. In a pan, mix ingredients for the sauce on low-medium heat. Allow it to bubble and simmer until thick, keep stirring during the process. This should take about 4-5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit on the side.
4. Coat chicken with corn starch. However, only coat what you will fry immediately. If you let the chicken sit too long in the starch, it will become a sludge.
5. In a shallow pot, add in a neutral flavored oil. Ensure the oil is hot (350° F) before you drop in your chicken. Cook in separate batches. Don't crowd the chicken as it will cause the temperature to drop too quickly and you won't get a nice brown outer layer. Fry each batch for 3 minutes.
6. After each batch, remove chicken with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to absorb some of the oil.
7. Once all the chicken has been fried a first time, put all the chicken back in for a second fry. No need to do this in batches. Fry for about 2 minutes.
8. Heat up the sweet and spicy sauce and add in the fried chicken. Mix well so each piece is evenly coated.
9. Heat up tortillas on a griddle of a pan until softened. Add chicken and top with coleslaw, kimchi, and white sesame seeds (optional). For some creaminess, use a light drizzle of mayo (optional).",2364
2021-09-23,6,"Roasted Marshmallow Rice Krispie Treats","yellowjacquet","# Roasted Marshmallow Rice Krispie Treats 

**with dark chocolate &amp; flakey sea salt**

Im convinced that a marshmallows transformation when roasted is basically magic, so I never miss an opportunity to toast them up when I can! Making rice crispy treats with roasted marshmallows adds a whole new layer of flavor (and the browned butter also bumps up the flavor of these bars).
  

  
Enjoy them plain or dipped in chocolate (I prefer them dipped) and top with some flakey sea salt to make this a truly elevated version of the classic!

# Ingredients

* 1 (10 oz) bag mini marshmallows
* 5 cups Rice Krispies cereal 
* 4 tbsp salted butter
* 10 oz dark chocolate pieces (optional)\*
* Flakey sea salt (optional)

\*You want to use chocolate that melts down nicely. Not all chocolate chips melt well, I use Ghirardelli brand chocolate chips for this.   


# Instructions 

1. Line a 9x13 pan with parchment paper or wax paper and lightly spray it with oil. 
2. In small saucepan over medium heat melt the butter. Continue cooking the butter, mixing frequently until it becomes a golden brown color (this will take about 5 minutes). Remove from heat. Transfer browned butter into a large heatproof bowl or pot where you will be able to easily stir your rice krispie treats together, and set aside.
3. Set oven to broil.
4. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Evenly spread the marshmallows onto sheet.
5. Place under broiler for \~1 minute until marshmallows are puffed and golden. Monitor the marshmallows continuously and rotate the sheet as needed to make sure all areas are roasted. 
6. Lightly spray a rubber spatula with oil and use it to scrape the marshmallows into the bowl with the butter. Stir quickly to combine, then add in the rice krispies cereal and mix until fully combined. 
7. Press the mixture evenly into the prepared 9x13 pan. Allow it to cool before cutting into squares and serving.
8. Optional: After cooling and cutting, melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Dip the rice krispie treats into the chocolate then set on wax paper to cool. When the chocolate is mostly cooled, top with the flakey sea salt to finish. Store in an airtight container.

Some call it Georgian cheese bread, but Khachapuri looks more like a cheese boat. It's said to have been created by the wives of fisherman to honor their husbands profession. By putting an egg on top of their Khachapuri, they moreover wish for good weather: the yolk representing the sun in this beautiful story.

**Enjoy the recipe and** [**United Cuisines on YouTube!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u1DySknOpM)

*INGREDIENTS FOR 2 KHACHAPURI:*

\- all purpose wheat flour \[2 cups / 250 g\]

\- dry yeast \[1 tsp / 5 g\]

\- salt &amp; sugar \[1 tsp / 5g each\]

\- lukewarm water \[3/4 cup / 180 ml\]

\- vegetable oil \[2 tsp / 10 ml\]

\- Greek Feta cheese \[7 oz / 200 g\]

\- low-moisture Mozzarella \[9 oz / 250 g\]

\- 2 eggs

\- butter \[1-2 tbsp / 20 g\]

*INSTRUCTIONS:*

1. Make sure that all your toppings are at room temperature and activate your dry yeast by mixing it with 3/4 cup of water \[105°F / 39°C\] and the sugar. Once activated, after 5-10 minutes, mix in the vegetable oil
2. Sift the flour into a big enough bowl, form a crater in the middle, and sprinkle the salt over the flour. Pour in the yeast-water and incorporate more and more flour into the liquid till everything is well combined
3. Manually knead your high hydration dough the best you can for around 7 minutes (stretch and fold works best). If you own a kneading machine, make sure not to overwork your dough. Grease the bowl with olive oil, cover it and let the dough rest for around 75 minutes or till doubling in size
4. Once doubled, knock back the dough, before placing it on a floured workplace and splitting into two even pieces. Knead both of them shortly, form two nice balls, cover and set aside for a few minutes
5. Prepare cheese-mix by crumbling/pulling the feta/mozzarella and combining both well. Start pre-heating the oven to 450°Fahrenheit or 230°Celsius
6. **During the whole process of opening, forming and filling the Khachapuri, I suggest you work on a big enough parchment paper**, for the dough is super sticky. Sprinkle some flour on the parchment paper, as well as dough, and start opening it by hand, before switching to a well-floured roll. Open the dough to a rectangular/oval(ish) shape, divide your cheese-mix into 4 equal portions and spread one portion of it along the long sides of your dough
7. Roll the dough over the cheese, form a nice boat shape and properly seal its ends, in order for the cheese to not run out, when melting in the oven. Grab another portion of cheese and spread it in the center of your Khachapuri
8. Grab all ends of the parchment paper and cautiously elevate your Khachapuri and transfer on the hot baking sheet. Bring along your second Khachapuri and cut off excess parts of the parchment paper, before placing the sheet on the lowest level lowest level in your oven and baking for 15 minutes
9. When nicely  golden, get them shortly out of the oven, form a small well in the cheesy middle and crush in an egg. Feel free to only add the yolk, for a richer taste. Back into the oven for 2-3 more minutes, till the bread gets a nice crust and the yolk is still runny

2021-09-20,26,"Tiramisu Cheesecake","mienczaczek","The combination of these two delicious desserts is sinful and sexy. Each spoonful asks for another and when everything is gone you look for more, addiction? Very likely!

Preparation is simple but it takes a little bit of waiting for the layers to set. Everything that takes time tastes a lot better and we are here for the quality of flavour! Enjoy cooking friends!

**The Biscuit Base**

For the base layer of the Tiramisu Cheesecake, you can use any type of digestive biscuits. I choose one cover with chocolate to add another layer of love to the recipe.

Be very careful not to add too much butter to the base as this will solidify it too much and you will not be able to dig in. We finish this layer with a nice shot of espresso but you can try different things to your liking.

**Chocolate Middle**

This layer is basically thick chocolate ganache with the liquor, you can skip alcohol completely and substitute it with almond extract or other baking aromas.

**Cheesecake Topping**

For this creamy layer, I like to use full-fat Philadelphia cheese, you can opt for a lighter version and lower the amount of sugar by half but why would you do this? It is a sin worthy dessert! I always recommend vanilla bean paste over the extract but use what's in your cupboard and it will still taste superb. You can also add any type of citrus zest that you like to create another layer of freshness in this dessert.

**Garnish**

If you go for simplicity and a more classical look cocoa powder is just fine. To elevate more use crushed dark chocolate or super tasty chocolate espresso beans.

**Ingredients for base:**

150g (5.3oz) of chocolate digestive biscuits

30g (1oz) of melted butter

3tsp of strong espresso

**Ingredients for chocolate layer:**

250g (8.8oz) of milk chocolate (drops or finely chopped)

150ml of double cream

100ml of coffee flavoured liquor like Tia Maria or Kahlua

**Ingredients for the cheesecake layer:**

150g (5.3oz) of cream cheese

100ml of double cream

1tsp vanilla bean paste

50g (1.7oz) of icing sugar

cocoa powder for garnish

**Instructions:**

For this recipe, you will need 5 dessert jars or glass bowls.

1. Crush chocolate digestive biscuits in a bag with a rolling pin then transfer to a bowl, combine with melted butter and 3tsp of strong espresso. With a help of a spoon transfer to glass bowls/jars and create a flat bottom layer then place in the fridge.
2. For the chocolate layer, place a bowl over a pan of simmering water and add the double cream, chocolate drops and liquor. Once chocolate melts, gently stir with a spatula until combined and pour into the jars. Place back in the fridge to set for 3-4h.

Tip: When cooking over simmering water (Bain-Marie): Make sure that the bowl doesn't touch the water, you want the steam to transfer the heat and do the cooking.

3. Once the chocolate layer is set you can proceed with the cheesecake, to do so use a hand or standing mixer. Beat the cream cheese to soften up then add vanilla bean paste, icing sugar and double cream. Whisk until stiff peaks then transfer to jars. Dust with cocoa powder and place back in the fridge for a couple of hours.

4. You can keep Tiramisu Cheesecake in the fridge for up to 3 days. Enjoy!

Cook Time: 20 minutes

Inactive Time: 50 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour 40 minutes 

Servings: 6 

Calories: 349kcal

### Equipment

* Baking sheet
* Large pot

### Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons avocado oil divided
* 2½ pound red or green kabocha divided
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons chili oil more or less depending on taste
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 6 cups water or vegetable stock plus more as needed
* 1 cup white rice
* Shichimi togarashi for serving
* Chili oil and sesame oil for serving
* Microgreens or sliced scallions optional, for serving
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Prepare the kabocha:

* Preheat oven to 400ºF. Place the kabocha on a baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a plate and let cool for 15-20 minutes. Do not turn the oven off.
* Once the kabocha is cool enough to handle, cut the kabocha in half from the top stem to the bottom of the kabocha.
* Scoop out the seeds and transfer to a sieve.
* Peel one half of the kabocha and cut the flesh into bite sized-cubes. Set aside.
* Leave the skin on the remaining half of the kabocha and cut it into 2 cubes. Set aside.

#### Prepare the soup base:

* Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon avocado oil in a large pot. Add the onion and cook for 7 minutes until it softens. Add the peeled kabocha cubes to the onion and cook for 35 minutes until it begins to turn golden brown. Season with salt and pepper.
* Melt the butter into the pot and add the chili oil and sesame oil. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2030 minutes until completely soft. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

#### Cook the squash seeds:

* As the broth simmers, prepare the seeds. Rinse the warm seeds under water and remove the stringy bits of kabocha from them. Pat the seeds dry and arrange on the same baking sheet used for the kabocha. Add more oil, if needed.
* Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the oven for 10 minutes, flipping once midway through. Remove from the oven once the seeds are golden brown and crispy. Set aside.

#### Cook the rice:

* Once the kabocha is very tender, mash it with a potato masher or use an immersion blender to blend until completely smooth. Add the rice and the skin-on kabocha and season with salt. Keep the heat on low and simmer for 30 minutes or until the kabocha cubes and rice are very tender. Add more water as necessary if the liquid evaporates too quickly. Stir the soup regularly to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Taste and season again to your preferences.

#### To serve:

* Ladle the rice soup into bowls and pile a few pieces of skin-on kabocha on top. Garnish with more chli and sesame oil, a sprinkle of shichimi togarashi, and a few microgreens. Sprinkle the crispy kabocha seeds on top. Enjoy!

2021-09-17,18,"Lightened up Loaded Potato Soup","yellowjacquet","Hello all! Obviously this recipe is not health food its a lighter alternative to a traditionally very heavy dish. For me, these changes take the dish from a special occasion indulgence to a reasonable weeknight meal.

If you look at normal potato soup recipes they typically call for heavy cream, extra butter (in addition to the bacon grease), and sour cream. This recipe uses the potatoes themselves to contribute to the creaminess of the soup instead! Russet potatoes dissolve much better than gold potatoes (or other waxy potatoes) so make sure you dont sub those! The size of the potato chunks is also important - too small and they will dissolve completely leaving no little chunks behind, too big and they wont dissolve enough and the soup will not be as creamy.

If youre looking to keep the dish lighter, use only 4 slices of bacon and dont overload the dish with cheese when topping. My biggest tip with this recipe (and really any potato based recipe) is to make sure you add enough salt! Potatoes absorb huge amounts of salt so they are frequently under-salted. Dont forget to taste the soup before serving and add more salt if needed!

# Lightened Up Loaded Potato Soup

Makes: 4 servings 

# Ingredients 

* 2 pounds Russet potatoes (about 2 large) peeled and cut into \~1 cm cubes \*
* 4-6 strips of bacon
* 1 large white onion, chopped fine
* 1½ tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 2 cups whole milk
* 2 cups water
* \~1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
* ¼  cup all-purpose flour
* \~3 green onions, greens sliced thin
* Salt &amp; pepper

\*Do not sub other potatoes, the texture of the russet potatoes allow them to dissolve into the soup which is critical. The size of the pieces is also important for them to dissolve properly, try not to cut them too large.

# Instructions

1. Heat a large, wide pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Cut the bacon into small pieces and cook it until it reaches your desired level of doneness (choose bacon quantity based on desired amount for topping later). Remove to a paper towel lined plate and leave the drippings in the pan.
2. Evaluate how much bacon grease is left in the pot (this will vary). You want about 2 tbsp, enough to thinly coat the bottom of the pot. If you have too much, spoon some out before proceeding. If you have too little, supplement with some veggie oil.  Cook the onions in the bacon drippings until they soften, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Add potatoes, garlic, 1 tsp  salt, and ¼ tsp pepper to the pot. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
4. Dust the flour over the mixture in the pot and stir until the ingredients are well mixed, \~2 minutes.
5. Add the milk and water and stir until well mixed. Bring to a boil over high heat, and then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer. 
6. The outsides of the potatoes will dissolve into the liquid, creating the rich creamy texture with small chunks of potato remaining. The longer you simmer the more the potatoes will dissolve into the soup, I simmer for at least 30 minutes but sometimes longer. Stir occasionally to prevent potatoes from sticking to the pan's bottom.
7. Before serving, add more salt and pepper to taste. Potatoes absorb a ton of salt, so it may feel like you are over-salting but you likely arent. Ladle into bowls and serve topped with shredded cheddar, fresh green onion, and the bacon bits.

**Make it Vegetarian -** Omit the bacon and sub 2 tbsp of veggie oil for the bacon grease. I have prepared it this way and its quite good! I haven't tried to prepare the dish with non-dairy milk and cheese but I imagine it would work well!

### Equipment

* Large pot
* Medium pot
* Small sieve
* Colander

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon avocado oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and sliced into half-moons
* 4 ounces baby shiitake mushrooms
* 6 cups vegetable stock
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons vegetarian dashi granules
* 2 tablespoons mirin
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 4 5- ounce frozen noodle packs if using Sun Noodle variety
* 4 eggs
* 1/3 cup tahini paste
* 1 heaping tablespoon white miso
* 2 3 tablespoons chili oil more or less depending on preference
* Salt to taste

#### For serving:

* Microgreens or sliced scallions
* Shichimi-togarashi
* Chili oil optional

### Instructions

#### Start the noodles:

* Fill a medium pot with water and bring to a boil.

#### Cook the broth:

* Heat the avocado oil in a large pot over medium-high heat as you wait for the water to boil. Add the onion and mushrooms and cook for 5-6 minutes until they begin to soften.

#### Simmer the broth:

* Pour in the vegetable stock. Add the soy sauce, dashi granules, mirin, and sesame oil to the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and allow it to simmer vigorously for about 1520 minutes or until the onions are soft. Taste and season to your preferences.

#### Cook the noodles:

* As you wait for the broth to finish simmering, cook the noodles according to package instructions. Frozen ramen will only need to cook for two or so minutes. Then, drain the noodles into a strainer and divide them between bowls.
* Fill the pot back up halfway with water and return to the stove over medium heat. Add the distilled white vinegar. Bring the water back to a vigorous simmer.

#### Poach the eggs:

* Place a small sieve over a bowl. Crack the first egg into the sieve and drop it carefully from the sieve into the simmering water. Use a wooden spoon to gently collect any wispy whites toward the egg.
* Continue on with the remaining eggs, dropping each one into the sieve and then into the water. Allow the eggs to poach until the whites have set, about 45 minutes. Remove the eggs in the order you dropped them into the water as the first egg you dropped in will be poached sooner than the egg you dropped in last.
* Transfer each egg to a bowl of noodles.

#### Finish the broth:

* Take the broth off the heat. Temper the tahini by scooping out one cup of the hot broth and whisking the tahini, miso, and chili oil into the warm liquid until smooth. Pour the mixture back into the pot and stir until smooth. Taste and season to your preferences.

#### To serve:

* Ladle the hot broth over the noodles. Sprinkle with shichimi-togarashi and garnish with microgreens or scallions. Finish with another drizzle of chili oil, if desired. Enjoy!

2021-09-16,127,"[MOD PSA] Post your recipe requests here!","AffectionateTrifle7","Sure thing, I have three that we make regularly. The chicken curry is fairly quick and just made on the stove top, but the beef curry and the chickpea curry go in the slow cooker, if you don't have one then cooking on the stove on a very low heat, stirring occasionally for 2-3 hours is probably your best option. If you can afford to buy a cheap slow cooker (you can get them for about $30 I believe, have a look on Amazon etc) I would really really recommend it not only for these recipes but many others. It just provides so much more flavour and a beautiful soft texture for the meat and chickpeas. Our slow cooker is only 3L and was pretty cheap, and we've used it soooo much. 


Chicken curry


Ingredients:

900g boneless/skinless chicken thighs, or chicken breast, cut into bite sized pieces (about 1 inch)

1 onion, chopped up small

3 garlic cloves, finely minced or crushed in a garlic crusher

1 Tbsp garam masala

1/2 tsp dried ginger powder

1/4 tsp chilli powder (if you like it hot, otherwise reduce to 1/8 tsp) -please note this is made from pure powdered hot chillies, there is some type of American thing called by a similar name which is much less hot because it also contains paprika, garlic powder, all kinds of stuff. If using that you will need to add a lot more. 

1 tsp ground cumin

1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (if you like it hot, otherwise reduce to 1/4 tsp)

400g tin of tomatoes chopped in puree (or tomato passata/ sauce (not ketchup) works well too, called different things in different locations)

4 tbsp butter 

Cream to taste (approx 1/2 a cup)

1 tsp salt 

Pepper to taste


Method:

Start with about 1 tbsp of butter in a frying pan or a large pot, add in the chopped onion. Fry on medium heat, adding more butter as needed and turning heat down as needed whenever parts start looking like they are going too fast (browning/slight burning).

Once the onions are soft and quite golden, add in the three crushed/minced garlic cloves. They should become fragrant within only about a minute of frying. 
Then add a bit more butter, and put the dried spices into the pan (garam masala, ginger, chilli powder, cumin, cayenne pepper). Wait around 30 seconds- 1 minute until they are fragrant, then add in the chicken. You can use thigh or breast, whatever you prefer. Cook on medium/low heat until the chicken is white on all sides and almost cooked through in the centre (if you cut one piece in half, it should be a tiny bit pink in the centre but otherwise white. This is because the chicken will continue to cook through the next steps and you don't want to have it get overcooked and dry). 

Add in the tin of tomatoes and 1 tsp salt. Allow the tomatoes to come to a gentle bubble, and simmer for about 5 mins, stirring now and then. Finally, add in the remaining butter, and approximately 1/2 a cup of cream (heavy cream if in America, single cream elsewhere). Add more cream to taste, and also add pepper and extra salt to taste if you like. Simmer the whole curry through for a couple of minutes, then it is ready to serve. Double check that the chicken is indeed white all the way through just before you take it off the heat. It ought to be but better safe than sorry! 





Beef curry


Ingredients:

800g beef braising steak/chuck steak, cut into 1 inch square pieces

2 onions chopped up small

4 garlic cloves, finely minced or crushed in a garlic crusher

1/4 tsp chilli powder (same as for chicken recipe this is pure powdered hot chillies, if using American version which has many other ingredients you will need more)

1 tsp ginger powder

4 tsp ground cumin

4 tsp ground coriander seeds

2 tsp ground turmeric

2 tsp garam masala

1 tsp salt

2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes (or equivalent amount of passata)


Method:

If you have a slow cooker, literally put all the listed ingredients in, give it a stir to distribute everything evenly, and put it on for 8 hours on low. 

If you are cooking on the stove, fry the onions a bit first in some butter, then add all the other ingredients. Start off on high heat to get all the ingredients up to a bubble, then turn the temp down so that it stays at a gentle simmer with the lid on. You will need this to simmer for 2-3 hours until the meat is very soft, stirring occasionally to prevent it burning to the bottom. You may need to add water to this method as you go, possibly about a cup in total, because more water is lost through the stove top method than the slow cooker method. 

I like to serve this curry with basmati rice, and I usually have some natural unsweetened yoghurt on the side to take off some of the heat. You can mix in cream to your serve if you prefer that, or even coconut cream if you like that better. 





Chickpea and sweet potato curry


Ingredients:

400g tin coconut cream

400g tin chopped tomatoes in puree (again, passata is also good)

9oz dried chickpeas

2 cups water

2 onions chopped up small

1 tsp salt

Fair few grinds pepper 

3 cups of fairly small chopped cubes of sweet potato

1 tbsp garam masala

Approx ¼ tsp chilli flakes, or 1/8 tsp chilli powder (pure hot chillies, see note in two previous recipes about this)

1.5 tsp cumin

½ tsp paprika

1 tsp turmeric

[ tsp ground cardamom

1 tsp ginger powder

1 tsp curry powder 

1/2 tsp garlic powder

4 garlic cloves crushed or finely minced


If using the slow cooker, put all the ingredients in, give it a mix, and put on low for 8 hours. 

If using the stove top method you will need to pre soak the chickpeas for about 8 hours in some cold water. Drain off that water and then begin the recipe. Start by frying the onions in some butter. Add all other ingredients except only add 1 cup of water instead of 2. Bring to a boil, then turn down to simmer for 2-3 hours with the lid on, stirring occasionally to prevent it sticking and burning. You will likely need to add extra water as it goes, possibly up to another full cup (which would make it equal to the original recipe, I just haven't tried this method so I'd rather be conservative and have you add as needed rather than give you a recipe which ends up being too runny). 


I hope you really enjoy these recipes! Feel free to scale them up if you need a larger batch. These two recipes provide many meals each for me and my husband but serving size is very individual. I suggest making the amounts as written first, and then adjusting upwards on later batches as needed",6419

**Ingredients**

**BROWNIE LAYER**

* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/3 cup melted butter (I used Miyokos Creamery Butter)
* 2 flax eggs (or regular eggs)
* 2/3 cup granulated erythritol (or regular sugar)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

**ICE CREAM LAYER**

* Two Pints of your favorite chocolate and/or vanilla ice cream (I used Halo Top)

**FROSTING LAYER**

* 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips  (I used Enjoy Life Vegan Chips)
* 1/4 cup  milk of choice ( I used cashew milk)
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter (I used Miyokos Creamery Butter)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* Pinch of salt

**OPTIONAL TOPPINGS**

* 1 cup of whipped cream
* 3/4 - 1 cup of crushed chocolate cream cookies

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. First, make your brownie layer. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease a 9 inch round springform pan and line with parchment paper. Mix all brownie ingredients well and spread evenly into the pan. Bake 15 minutes, then let cool completely.
2. While brownie layer is cooling, allow ice cream to slightly soften out of the freezer for easier spreading. Once brownie layer is cooled add ice cream on top and spread evenly. Put pan inside freezer and allow at least 4 hours for ice cream to completely firm up before adding frosting
3. Make frosting: In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, mix together the chocolate chips, milk, butter, vanilla extract and salt. Stir until melted and completely smooth. Allow to cool completely. Remove cake pan from freezer and evenly spread frosting over top ice cream layer.
4. Now you may spread an even layer of whipped cream over top if youd like and evenly sprinkle crushed up cookies or any other preferred topping, allow to firm again in the freezer before slicing into cake and enjoy!

Often I will prep the dry rub and the side dishes in the morning and just pop it into the pressure cooker for dinner. We find it hard to find ribs that are perfect and for us, these are on point! Dont have a pressure cooker? Dont worry, check out the recipe for tips on how to use your slow cooker or oven to get these ribs!  
  
**Orange Glazed Baby Back Ribs**  
  
Video link here: https://youtu.be/-SaklnXRJC0  
  
**INGREDIENTS**  
  
1 rack of baby back ribs (800g aprox)  
  
2tsp smoked paprika  
  
2 tsp ground cumin  
  
2 tsp ground fennel  
  
2 tsp garlic powder  
  
2 tsp onion powder  
  
2 tsp black pepper  
  
1 tsp salt  
  
2 tablespoons of brown sugar  
  
Zest of one large orange  
  
1 minced onion  
  
4 garlic cloves minced  
  
100 ml barbecue sauce  
  
Juice of one large orange (aprox 80-100 ml)  
  
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar  
  
1 tbsp honey  
  
1 tbsp black molasses\*  
  
2 tsp dried parsley  
  
2 tsp dried oregano  
  
2 tbsp of wholegrain mustard\* (can substitute this with dijon)  
  
\*You can substitute this for 1 tbsp dark sugar, maple syrup, black treacle, just be aware of the different levels of sweetness and bitterness.  
  
**INSTRUCTIONS**  
  
Mix all the dry rub ingredients and rub it all over the baby back ribs. You can set this aside for at least 30 minutes if youre short of time but overnight (10-12 hours) in the fridge yields the best flavour.  
  
Mix the sauce ingredients in the pressure cooker bowl and add the ribs, coating with the sauce mixture.  
  
Pressure cook on high for 16-25 minutes.\*\* Remember to be careful of the steam from the cooker. You can adjust your cooking time to preference: 16 minutes is tender with a bit of chew and 25 minutes will fall off the bone. We went for 20 minutes for a good balance between the two.  
  
Preheat the oven to 220c or heat the oven grill.  
  
Carefully remove the ribs from the pressure cooker and place on a roasting tray, cover with foil and set aside.  
  
Reduce the sauce by bringing it to a simmer until it reaches a thick glaze, approximately 6-8 minutes. Stirring occasionally and season to taste.  
  
Apply the sauce all over the ribs using a brush and place the ribs on the top oven rack for 10-15 minutes. Until it reaches the colour of your liking, we really love the dark, caramelised bits!  
  
Serve with the sides of your liking and enjoy!  
  
\*\*Slow Cooker: Follow the steps 1 &amp; 2 and at 3, place the ribs in the slow cooker and set to low for 8 hours or high for 4 hours. Continue with steps 4 onwards.  
  
\*\*Oven: Preheat the oven to 135c, place the seasoned ribs (step 1) covered in the oven for 3-4 hours. Mix the sauce ingredients and reduce in a pan to a thick glaze. Remove the ribs from the oven, uncover and then follow step 7.",2964

Ube Paste  
- 1 cup steamed and grated ube  
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar  
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter  
- 1/2 cup water
 
Mochi  
- 1/2 cup glutinous rice flour  
- 1 tbsp granulated sugar  
- 1 tbsp cornstarch  
- 3/4 cup water  
- 3/4 tbsp vegetable oil

- 4.5 tbsp unsalted softened butter  
- 1/2 cup and 2 tbsp all-purpose flour  
- 2 tsp ube extract  
Water Dough  
- 3/4 cup and 1 tbsp all-purpose flour  
- 1 tbsp granulated sugar  
- 3 tbsp unsalted softened butter  
- 1/4 cup water  
   
INSTRUCTIONS  
Ube Paste  
1. In a large bowl, mix together the steamed and grated ube along with the sugar, butter, and water until well combined  
2. Pour the mixture onto a pan on medium-high heat and cook until the paste forms and clings to itself, away from the pan  
3. Transfer the ube paste to a heatproof bowl and cover with plastic wrap so that the plastic wrap touches the surface of the ube paste  
4. Refrigerate until cool  
5. Once cooled, divide the ube paste into 12 equal-sized balls  

Mochi  
1. In a microwave-safe bowl combine the glutinous rice flour, sugar, cornstarch, water, and oil until well combined  
2. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 2 minutes  
3. Remove from the microwave and stir the mochi around  
4. Cover the bowl again and microwave for another 2 minutes  
5. Remove from the microwave and stir the mochi around  
6. Cover the bowl again and microwave for a final 30 seconds  
7. Remove from the microwave and give it one final stir before covering with plastic wrap (so that the film touches the top of the mochi) and allow to completely cool  
8. Once cooled, divide the mochi into 12 equal-sized balls  

Mooncake Pastry  
1. For the water dough, in a large bowl combine the flour, sugar, water, and softened butter  
2. Gently knead the dough until it forms and comes together (does not necessarily need to be smooth or pass the windowpane test at this point)  
3. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and allow to sit for 30 minutes  
4. For the oil dough, in a small bowl combine the flour, butter, and ube extract  
5. Knead the dough until it forms together and then wrap it with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to sit for 20 minutes  
6. Once both of the dough have rested, divide each of them into 6 equal-sized balls  
7. Take a white, water dough ball and flatten it out into a circle. Fully encase this dough around the purple oil dough ball  
8. Repeat this step for all the dough balls  
9. Take one of the encased balls and, with the seam side down, roll out the dough into a long strip  
10. Take the edge with the least amount of white dough and start to roll up the dough from one end to the other until you have a log  
11. Repeat the above two steps with the rest of the dough balls  
12. Then take the dough log, and placing it down vertically with the seam side down, roll it out into a long thin rectangle  
13. Once again roll up the dough into a log and cut it in half  
14. Repeat the above two steps with the rest of the dough logs  
Note: Throughout this entire process ensure that the dough is always covered with plastic wrap once done using it!  

Assembly  
1. Preheat the oven to 340F  
2. Take a ball of ube paste and wrap it around a cooled ball of mochi  
3. Repeat this until you have 12 evenly sized ube mochi balls  
4. Take a halved log of the mooncake pastry and, with the cut side down, carefully roll it out into a circle  
5. Place the ball of ube mochi into the center and wrap the pastry around that (it's important to ensure that the previously cut side of the dough is the side that is on the outside of the mooncake once the ube mochi ball has been wrapped)  
6. Repeat the above two steps for the rest of the ube mochi balls  
7. Place the mooncakes on a lined baking sheet and bake for 20-22 minutes  
8. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack before enjoying!

* Skillet

## Ingredients

* 1 pound small dry white beans, soaked according to package instructions; or use 2 15-ounce cans navy beans and drain and rinse them first
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 2 shallots peeled and diced, or use any onion variety
* 3 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and diced
* 2 tablespoons butter plant-based or dairy, optional
* 12 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and thinly sliced
* 2 teaspoons silk chili flakes (or use 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper/cayenne powder plus a little paprika)
* 1/2 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1/2 teaspoon dry parsley
* 6 cups water or vegetable stock plus more if needed
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Mushroom topping (optional):

* 2 tablespoons butter plant-based or dairy
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 4 ounces mushrooms of your choice such as beech, cremini, or shiitake
* 1 ounce pine nuts, almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, or your favorite nut/seed of choice
* Salt to taste

## For serving:

* Fresh parsley minced

## Instructions

## Soak the beans (optional):

* If using dry beans, soak them according to package instructions in a large pot. Small beans may only need an hour or two of soaking time. Drain them and set them aside. Return the pot to the stovetop and wipe it out.

## Cook the aromatics:

* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in the large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the shallots and celery and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 6-7 minutes. Season lightly with salt.

## Cook the mushrooms:

* Melt the butter into the shallot and celery. Once frothy, add the mushrooms. Cook for 8-10 minutes until the mushrooms release all their liquid and begin to brown and crisp up around the edges. Season with salt.

## Cook the beans:

* Add the silk chili, thyme, and parsley and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the soaked beans and toss to coat.

## Simmer the beans:

* Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for at least 30 minutes or until the beans are tender. Small beans, like the Alubia Blanca, take around 1 hour to become tender. If using canned beans, simmer for only 30 minutes. Add more stock or water as necessary if the broth evaporates too quicklytaste and season with salt and pepper.

## Cook the topping:

* Once the beans are ready to be served, prepare the topping. Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat until melted and frothy. Add the mushrooms and cook for 3 minutes until they begin to brown. Add the pine nuts and cook for an additional 2 minutes until browned. Be careful not to burn the pine nuts! Turn off the heat and season lightly with flaky sea salt.

## To serve:

* Ladle the cooked beans into bowls and garnish with minced parsley. Scatter the warm mushroom and pine nuts on top. Enjoy!

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil plus more as needed
* 1 shallot peeled and diced
* 3 broccoli crowns cut into florets

### Instructions

#### Cook the shallot:

* Heat the oil in a wide skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, for 34 minutes until it begins to soften.

#### Cook the broccoli:

* Add the broccoli florets and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes until it turns bright green. Do not overcook the broccoli! Transfer the broccoli and shallots to a bowl.

#### Cook the Brussels sprouts:

* Add another drizzle of oil to the skillet and turn the heat back to medium-high. Add the Brussels sprouts and cook in an even layer for 23 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 23 minutes until the Brussels sprouts are well-browned all over. Season with salt and pepper and transfer them to the bowl with the broccoli.

* Turn the heat on the skillet to medium. Melt butter into the skillet and add the capers and crushed red pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.

#### Crisp up the rice:

* Pour the rice over the capers and flatten it into an even layer. Cook without moving for 35 minutes, using your spoon to press the rice into the hot skillet, allowing it to crisp up in places.

#### Add the cheese:

* Pour the cheese over the rice and spread it into an even layer. Pour the cooked broccoli and Brussels sprouts over the cheese. Add the lemon juice and then stir to combine everything together. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 13 minutes more until the cheese is melted. Turn off the heat.

**INGREDIENTS**  

* 1-1/2 c granulated sugar
* 1/2 c light brown sugar, packed
* 1/2 c whole milk
* 1 Tbsp salted butter
* 1 c creamy peanut butter
* 1 tsp vanilla extract  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

* In a pot, over medium to medium-high heat, pour in sugars, then butter, then pour the milk over everything. Dont stir, but rather just gently nudge it to make sure all the sugar is covered by the milk.
* Pretty quickly, youll start to notice it boiling around the edges. Let it get going, then let it boil for about 2 minutes. Do not stir.
* Remove from heat and stir in the peanut butter and vanilla extract. Stir pretty vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes until smooth and thickened a bit. If you prefer, you can also use a stand mixer.
* Pour into a parchment lined 9 x 9 pan and smooth out the top with a rubber spatula.
* Let set at room temperature for 2 hours.
* Slice and serve at room temperature or refrigerated. My old fashioned peanut butter fudge is pretty soft at room temperature, so if you prefer a slightly firmer bite, refrigerate it first.

Recipe VIDEO [https://youtu.be/SIBaCWpIvEQ](https://youtu.be/SIBaCWpIvEQ)

RECIPE 

* 150 ml heavy cream
* 370 ml whole milk
* 6.25 oz (177 g) khoya/mawa (solid milk)
* 4 slices of sandwich bread (not stale bread)
* 1/3 cup mix of almond and cashew
* 2 tablespoons raisins (Soaking in water for some time will help to plump it up)
* 6 green cardamoms
* 3 tablespoons sugar  


1. Grate the khoya to a non-stick skillet, sprinkle 1 and ½ tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons milk and give it mix. Stir it around for 10 minutes in medium heat. It will soften down and then comes together like a dough without sticking to the pan.
2. Take it off once done and keep it aside to be used later.
3. To the same skillet, pour the milk and the heavy cream along with rest of the sugar, crushed cardamoms and give a mix. Let it simmer in medium heat for 10 minutes.
4. Then add 1/3rd of the khoya mixture to the skillet and stir around to incorporate the khoya to the milk. It will make it creamier. Simmer for 5 minutes.
5. Add some of the chopped nuts and soaked raisins, give a mix and keep it aside to cool down a little bit. The malai milk is ready.
6. In the meantime, slice the sides off the breads. And roll it gently to thin it out.
7. If the khoya mixture looks dry, add couple tablespoons of the flavored milk to soften the texture. Spread 1 and ½ tablespoons of the khoya mixture on one end of the bread, and dab water at the other end of the bread. Roll it firmly and press a little to seal it tight. Then slice in half using a bread knife 
8. Layer the bread roll seam side down on a serving platter.
9. The malai milk should be little hot when you pour it on the bread roll. So, if it feels cold, just warm it up and then pour it on the bread roll. Scatter rest of the chopped nuts and soaked raisins on top and enjoy it.",1899

**INGREDIENTS:**

7g Shiitake Mushrooms

7g (5 inch/13 cm piece) Kombu

15g Bonito flakes

250mL (1 Cup) water

100g (about 100mL) Sugar

80mL (1/3 Cup) Balsamic Vinegar

250mL (1 Cup) Soy Sauce

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Soak Shiitake Mushrooms in cold water for about 6-8 hours ahead of time. Then slice into thin strips. Discard the water and rinse the mushrooms if you see too much dirt in the water.
2. Bring 1 cup of cold water with the Kombu to a boil, then take out the Kombu and discard. 
3. Add Shiitake Mushrooms, sugar, balsamic vinegar, and soy sauce to the same pot of water. Bring to a boil and turn off the heat. Cover it and let the flavors infuse for 1 hour.
4. After 1 hour, bring the liquid back to a boil the second time and add in Bonito flakes. Cover it for 5 minutes.
5. Strain the liquid into a wide pan through a fine mesh. Boil this liquid down to a syrup such that the sauce stays on the plate when you drag the sauce across the plate (see video if you need a reference).
6. If you reduced the sauce too much and has become too thick, add 2 tablespoons of water (repeat if needed) and mix to make it less viscous on the heat.
7. Let it cool down a bit first then transfer to a squeeze bottle (if you have one). Otherwise, any container to hold your sauce in the fridge is perfectly fine. 
8. It's important that you WAIT 24 HOURS before using your sauce. At this point, the sauce is too sharp to consume immediately. After 24 hours, all the flavors will round out.

Notes: With regard to extra Kombu, dry Shiitake Mushrooms, and Bonito flakes - these items will last almost indefinitely as long as you store them in a dry and cool place.  The ingredients that you strained out can be consumed if you wish, some people find it unpleasant to eat. The sauce can be kept in the fridge for a very long time.

Otherwise, here's my recipe:

**Ingredients**  
2lb Large Shrimp  
20oz Smoked Sausage, sliced  
8 Corn Cob Halves  
5-6 Large Red Potatoes, cut into small pieces (about 1"")  
4 Garlic Bulbs, tip cut off  
4 Tablespoons Olive Oil  
4 Tablespoons Crab Boil  
4 Tablespoons Parsley, freshly chopped  
**Instructions**  
If you are using a charcoal grill, go ahead and light your coals and let them get red.  
Cut 8 pieces of foil (each about 24""). Lay 2 pieces down on top of each other.  
Take 1 Tablespoon of the olive oil and pour it on the top side of the foil.  
Using your fingers rub that oil all over that foil surface.  
Take 1 quarter of the ingredients - 2 pieces of corn, 1 garlic bulb, some potatoes, shrimp and sausage and place over on one side of the foil.  
Take 1 Tablespoon of the crab boil and sprinkle all over the ingredients.  
Close the other side of the foil over the top of the ingredients. Crimp all sides closed and make sure there are no seams open.  
Repeat this process with the other three foil packets.  
Lay the foil packets on the grill and allow to cook for 15 minutes (+/-) turning the packets half way.  
After you remove them from the grill, open up and sprinkle with the tablespoon of parsley and add lemon wedges to serve.  
**Notes**  
The amount of spice in boiled shrimp is a personal preference. You may feel like 1 tablespoon of crab boil is not enough. Feel free to add more as required. (or less).  
  
Make sure the potatoes are small in size as they will not cook in time. If you prefer your potatoes bigger perhaps try partially cooking them first.",1939

2021-09-07,10,"Pineapple Mooncakes Recipe","cookingwithRobin","A mooncake is a Chinese pastry served during the mid-autumn festival which is the second biggest festival in China after Chinese new year. The date is usually in September or October depending on the lunar calendar (It is September 21st this year). On this night, the moon is supposed to be the biggest and roundest of the year. To celebrate, Chinese families will often get together to enjoy a delicious dinner followed by riddle guessing and moon watching. Many types of fillings can be found in traditional mooncakes, such as salted eggs with lotus seed paste, sweet red bean paste, jujube paste, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

[A video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/L_fTMSFAISY)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients (8 mooncakes):**

\- 400g fresh pineapple chunks

\- 30g maltose syrup or corn syrup

\- 45g sugar

\- 125g cake flour or all-purpose flour

\- 75g honey

\- 35g oil

\- 5g alkaline water or water

\- A 50g mooncake mold (A wide selection can be found on Amazon for less than $10)

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Mix the honey, oil, alkaline water, and flour together to form a dough. Cover it with a plastic wrapper and let it rest at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours.
2. Blend the fresh pineapple chunks, add some sugar and maltose or corn syrup, and cook it using medium heat until sticky. Let it cool down.
3. Divide the pineapple filling into 8 pieces (20g each) and make them into a ball shape.
4. Divide the dough into 8 pieces (30g each) and make them into a ball shape.
5. Press down the dough in your palm to a flat round shape. Place one filling in the center. Slowly move the dough up and seal the seam. Shape it into a smooth ball and then press it into a mooncake using the mold.
6. Bake for 5 minutes at 400oF.
7. Take the mooncakes out from the oven. Brush on a very thin layer of the egg wash (1 egg yolk + 1 tbsp water).
8. Bake for 15 minutes at 325oF.
9. The freshly baked mooncakes are hard and dry. Store them in a sealed container at room temperature for 2-3 days before serving. It takes time for the skin to become silk smooth and soft. Please be patient and enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. Alkaline water doesn't change the taste, it is only used to darken the mooncake skin color. I used the regular filtered water, so my mooncakes are not as orange as the ones sold in markets.
2. 400g pineapple chunks can make 160g filling. If the filling is too wet, the steam will break the mooncake skin during baking.
3. Make sure to brush on a VERY THIN layer of the egg wash. Thick egg wash will blur the mooncake's look.",2584

Calories: 359kcal

## Equipment

* Large pot
* Small skillet

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil
* 2 shallots peeled and diced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 pound mixed mushrooms sliced, diced, or torn depending on the variety
* 1/3 cup flour
* 5 6 cups water or stock
* 1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper
* 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper optional
* 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
* 5 Yukon gold potatoes peeled and diced into 1 cubes
* 5 ears of corn husked and corn cut from the cob
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* Salt to taste

## Mushroom topping:

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 4 ounces mushrooms sliced, diced, or torn depending on variety
* 4 ounces biquinho peppers or diced bell peppers cherry tomatoes, or chopped roasted red bell peppers

## Instructions

## Cook the aromatics:

* Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the diced shallot and cook for 5 minutes.

## Cook the mushrooms:

* Melt the butter into the shallot and add the mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes until the mushrooms turn golden brown. Continue cooking until they release their liquid and the liquid evaporates. You want to ensure that your mushrooms develop a golden crust! Season with salt.

## Prepare the roux:

* Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and stir to coat. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the flour begins to turn a light golden color.
* Slowly whisk in one cup of liquid and whisk until smooth. Continue adding the liquid, one cup at a time, whisking after each addition until 5 cups of the liquid have been incorporated. If the broth seems too thick, add the remaining 1 cup of liquidseason with salt, white pepper, crushed red pepper, and Aleppo pepper (if using). Bring to a boil.

## Simmer the chowder:

* Add the corn and potatoes to the boiling chowder and immediately reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutestaste and season to your preferences. Once the potatoes are fork-tender, turn off the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Note: If you are using milk, half and half, or sour cream, be sure to temper them before adding to the chowder. Scoop out a bowl of the hot broth and stir the cold milk or sour cream into it and then add it back to the chowder. If using heavy cream, you do not need to temper it.

## Prepare the garnish:

* After you've added the heavy cream to the chowder, prepare the garnish. Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a small skillet. Once hot, melt the butter and add the mushrooms and peppers. Cook without moving for 3-4 minutes until golden brown. Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes. Turn off the heat and season with salt.

## To serve:

* Ladle the chowder into bowls and spoon the hot mushrooms and peppers on top. Sprinkle with more red pepper flakes on top if desired. Enjoy!

2021-09-07,3,"Russian Steak Gravy AKA Beef Stroganoff","unitedcuisines","Beef Stroganoff: tasty, creamy and very comforting! Also rather easy-to-make and takes less than 20 minutes to prep.

You can have it with pasta, mashed potatoes, polenta or even fries. No matter what you serve your Beef Stroganoff with, enjoy!

INGREDIENTS:

\- good quality, not too tough cut of beef, such as sirloin or rib-eye \[10 oz / 300 g\]

\- vegetable oil \[1 tbsp / 15 ml\]

\- butter \[1 tbsp / 15 g\]

\- half an onion

\- button or cremini mushrooms \[4 oz / 120 g\]

\- 1 big garlic clove

\- all purpose flour \[1 tbsp\]

\- beef broth \[1 cup / 250 ml\]

\- crème fraîche \[1/3 cup / 80 g\]

\- Dijon mustard \[2 tsp / 10 g\]

\- a handful of chopped chives

Servings: 2

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Cut the beef into small stripes of approximately 8mm or 1/3inch in thickness and 3-4 cm, or 1-1.5inch in lenth. Maybe a bit shorter, if you re cooking for children. Slice the mushrooms and roughly chop the onion, too
2. Over high heat, sprinkle half a tablespoon of vegetable oil into your pan, which should preferably be NOT non-stick, to better sear the meat. Once the pan is really hot, season your meat with salt and pepper and immediately transfer into the pan. DON'T overcrowd the pan and fry stripes for 30-45 seconds. Quickly turn once browned and sear from other side for another 30-45 seconds and set aside on a plate
3. Once you seared your meat, reduce the heat to medium, and, into the same pan, add a tablespoon of butter and sauté the mushrooms and onion in it for approximately 5 minutes
4. When the mushrooms start to nicely brown, crush in a big garlic clove into the mix and fry together for one minute, or till fragrant
5. Sprinkle a tablespoon of all purpose flour on top, stir constantly and toast the flour for a minute, before deglazing everything with a cup of beef broth
6. Add the crème fraîche, as well as mustard and mix well. Bring to a slight boil, reduce the heat of the pan to low and let simmer for 5-10 minutes, till the sauce reduces to the consistency of your choice
7. When your gravy's texture is almost right, season it with salt and pepper to taste and bring back the meat and mix it into the gravy. Turn off the heat after a minute, sprinkle a tablespoon of finely chopped chives on your beef Stroganoff and that's it! NOTE: If you got a good, rather tender cut, you don't need to and shouldn't cook the meat in the gravy anymore, for it will overcook and get tough. Whereas, when you get a rather tough cut such as Chuck, you will need to cook it in the gravy for 1-1.5hours

**Ingredients**

for 12 cookies

½ cup granulated sugar (100 g)

¾ cup brown sugar (165 g), packed

1 teaspoon salt

½ cup unsalted butter (115 g), melted

1 egg

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour (155 g)

½ teaspoon baking soda

4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks (110 g)

4 oz dark chocolate chunk (110 g), or your preference

&amp;#x200B;

**Preparation**

In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.

Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.

Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).

Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavour and deeper colour, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavour will be.

Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.

Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.

Cool completely before serving.

**Gravy:**  
4 breakfast sausage patties (or half a lb. of bulk or appr. 6 links removed from casing)  
2-3 T. of neutral oil or bacon grease (I use the latter)  
¾ c. AP flour  
2 cups milk (whole or 2%)  
Red pepper flake (optional)  
Black pepper (coarsely ground if you have it)  
salt to taste

Brown the sausage in either oil or bacon grease (a decent sausage doesn't produce enough grease for this.)  
Sprinkle in the flour. Stir to coat the sausage. Continue stirring until the flour browns to remove the taste of the flour.  
Add the milk and (patiently) stir continuously until it thickens. Taste and add salt as needed.

2 c. AP flour  
1 T baking powder  
2 t sugar  
1 t salt  
½ c neutral oil  
1 c  milk (whole or 2%)

It's chewy on the inside and crispy outside, and made on a flat top but I just can't get it right. Any ideas?","literallyanythingr","No disrespect to any of the other commenters, but this chicken is not deep fried& replicating this would be simple by pat drying your chicken, and then dredging it in flour or cornstarch as one of the other comments said. This will get you that nice golden brown sear on the chicken. Hibachi tables are awesome cause they hit some seriously hot temps, but when cooking in a skillet, a little flour or cornstarch will dry the chicken resulting in a similar sear without as much heat necessary.

**Full recipe with pictures** [**HERE**](https://tasteabroad.com/recipe/seared-skirt-steak-with-chimichurri-sauce/)!

**INGREDIENTS:**

*FOR STEAK MARINADE*

* *1,5 lb Skirt Steak*
* *1 lime Lime Juice*
* *1 lime Zest of Lime*
* *2 cloves Garlic*
* *1 tablespoon Soy Sauce*
* *2 tablespoons Worcestershire Sauce*
* *1/4 cup Olive oil*
* *1/4 teaspoon salt*

FOR CHIMICHURRI SAUCE

* *1/2 cup Fresh Parsley*
* *1 clove Garlic*
* *2 sprigs Fresh Oregano*
* *1 tablespoon Red Wine Vinegar*
* *1/2 cup Olive oil*
* *black pepper to taste*
* *1/2 teaspoon crushed Red Pepper*

**DIRECTIONS:**

&gt;**Marinate the steak**

1. Place your beef cut in a plastic bag or ziplock and add all marinade ingredients to it. Do not bother premixing it in a bowl  just seal and shake! Place in the fridge for as long as 24 hours prior to cooking.
2. If you dont have much time to marinate the steak  warm up the marinade in a cooking pan before pouring it into the bag, it will speed up the process. But do not make it too hot, no one likes boiled beef right?  You can let the bag with marinated steak on the countertop cool down then place it in the fridge for 30 min.

&gt;**Chimichurri sauce**

1. For the chimichurri sauce, I use a mortar and a pestle (stone grinding bowl) to mash my garlic with salt. You also can mash garlic with your knife.
2. Mash garlic with a pinch of salt.
3. Add black pepper (I used black peppercorns from my pepper grinder for extra flavor) and crush.
4. Add olive oil and vinegar to mortar and mix well with garlic and pepper mash.
5. Finely chop fresh parsley and oregano.
6. Mix herbs with the rest of the sauce.
7. Add red pepper flakes to taste. I use 1/4 of a teaspoon.

&gt;**Sear the steak**

1. After you let the beef marinate, take it out of the sauce.
2. Place beef on a high heated pan ( I use skillet pan but any type would work, to be honest), and depending on the thickness cook 2 minutes on each side.
3. Let rest for at least 5 minutes.

&gt;**Slice and serve**

1. Slice thin across the beef structure ( basically look for long lines of beef muscle and cut across not along to make the beef taste even softer) and pour chimichurri over it.

2021-08-31,14,"Dry Rub BBQ Chicken (Freezer Friendly!)","yellowjacquet","# Dry Rub BBQ Chicken

Stock your freezer with this shredded BBQ chicken! Having flavorful precooked meat in the freezer is an excellent meal-prepping trick to cut down on dinner prep or provide a super easy meal when you just dont feel like cooking. This chicken can be used as a flavorful finish to pastas or salads, or tossed into a loaded grilled cheese for a super low-effort meal! There are so many possible uses for this chicken!

I typically prepare this in my smoker (and if you have a smoker absolutely go that route) but I tested it in the oven as well and the results are still delicious! Not quite as flavorful as the smoked chicken but still super tasty shredded chicken that I would absolutely recommend! Do future-you a favor and stock your freezer with this!

# Ingredients

* 10 -12 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts

For dry rub:

* ½ cup dark brown sugar
* ¼ cup kosher salt
* 2 tbsp garlic powder
* 1 tbsp black pepper
* 1 tbsp onion powder
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika
* 1 tbsp chili powder

# Preparation

1. Begin preheating a smoker or the oven to 250° F. If preparing in the oven, line a baking sheet with foil then place a wire rack on it, lightly spray with oil (will need 2X if cooking 10 -12 lbs of chicken).
2. Mix together all of the dry rub ingredients and set aside.
3. Trim any excess fat off the chicken breasts then dust them with the dry rub. Use clean hands to rub the dry rub into the meat, flip and repeat with the other side so the chicken is fully coated.
4. Place the chicken breast in the smoker or oven and cook until the chicken reaches an internal temp of 165° F in the thickest portion. Use a leave-in meat thermometer to monitor the temperature. This should take 60-90 minutes in the oven, and 2-4 hours in a smoker.
5. Once the chicken is cooked through shred each breast. (The meat will be soft but may develop a hard outer bark. Use two forks to shred, if the bark is difficult to shred use a knife to cut the chicken into large chunks then shred those. )

# Notes

* **To freeze:** Separate into the portions you expect to use (I use 10-12 oz per meal for two adults). Seal these portions in a zip bag with the air pressed out or vacuum seal if you are able. Place the packets in the freezer until ready to use.
* **To reheat:** Place the sealed bag of frozen chicken in a bowl of warm water, let it sit until it's mostly defrosted. Transfer the chicken to a microwave safe container and warm in the microwave, tossing every 30 seconds, until heated through.
* **Use the chicken in:** Loaded grilled cheese sandwiches, quesadillas, on pizza, on pasta, on salads, in soup, in tacos, whatever you can think of!
* Obviously making this chicken in a smoker rather than the oven adds additional flavor, but its still quite good out of the oven!

1/4 cup macadamia nuts, roughly chopped 

250 g butter, softened

3 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped

2 fresh lime leaves, chopped

1 large red chili, diced

1 tablespoons lime juice

Toast chopped macadamia nuts on medium heat, tossing until golden. Transfer to a bowl to cool.

Mix all ingredients in a medium bowl until well combined. 

Place mixture on a piece of plastic wrap about 8 in long. Roll mixture into a log shape and wrap tightly. Chill until required. 

This recipe for an easy flavored butter was delicious - 5/5 
I tried it with bread, but also to flavor sautéed veggies and it worked perfectly. 

Notes: I did have to make a couple of substitutions to this recipe due to lack of availability and other issues. Lime leaves are not widely available in my region, so I used 1/4 teaspoon lime zest in it's place. Cilantro, on the other hand, is available in my region, but I have been relying on instacart deliveries due to a rise in covid cases, and I received parsley instead of the Cilantro I ordered. I decided to just use it and see how things turned out - not bad.",1160
2021-08-28,12,"Tajin Sword fish ranch parmesan pasta recipe in comments.","OgMarcoWolf","Ingredients. 

1 sword fish steak approximately 1 1/2- 2 inches thick

Tajin seasoning to taste (I used like 1-2 table spoons but it's preference based)

1 table spoon hidden valley ranch powder

1/4 cup pasta water

Parmesan to taste fresh grated

Choice of pasta I used 1 box of elbow Mac.

1 pinch of salt (to taste) 

Wet ranch the amount depends on how much it takes you to get the right consistency. I used marzeties I think is the brand name. 

Step 1. Season steak lightly with some of the Tajin.

Step 2. Cook the swordfish steak at about 325 for 20 minutes. I did this in my air fryer. Do not flip steak. You want it to be kind of mushy almost patee consistency.

Step 3. Start the pasta water (do not use oil in the water or the sauce won't stick) while you wait. Remember to save the amount of pasta water specified. 

Step 4. while the pasta finishes cooking start the sauce by mixing wet ranch sauce with rest of Tajin to taste and the finished sword fish steak. You want it to adhere to the fork or whatever you mix with. Should be more runny than a patee but less runny than an Alfredo. 

Step 5. Add sauce to finished pasta and mix thoroughly with the pasta water you saved.

Step 6. Grate cheese and mix with pasta. 

Step 7. Curse my name for coming up with this because it has no right to be tasty but is.",1325

4. Combine the flour, baking soda, as well as salt in a separate bowl and gradually sift it into the batter and whisk well
5. Grease an oven safe form \[approx. 8x8 inches / 20x20 cm\], transfer the batter into it and spread it evenly

8. When the cake is done, take it out of the oven and pour the sauce over the cake. The sauce will be fully absorbed by the cake within minutes

If you eat meat, this would be delicious with a bit of diced chorizo cooked down first and then mushrooms added to the fat rendered from the chorizo ;)

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour

Servings: 4

Calories: 380kcal

## Equipment

* Large pot
* Grater

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 2 shallots peeled and small-diced
* 16 ounces mixed mushrooms trimmed and finely diced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon sweet paprika
* 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
* 1 teaspoon hot paprika
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* ¼ teaspoon white pepper
* ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper or cayenne pepper to taste
* 1 cup carnaroli or arborio rice
* 56 cups warm stock or water more or less depending on your rice
* ½ cup freshly grated manchego cheese plus more for serving
* ¼ cup fresh parsley leaves minced; optional
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

## Sauté the shallot:

* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes until softened.

## Cook the mushrooms:

* Add the mushroomsin batches if neededto the shallot and cook for 8-9 minutes until they are golden brown around the edges. Season with salt and pepper. If you cooked the mushrooms in batches, return all of them to the pot.

## Bloom the spices:

* Create an open space in the center of the mushrooms and add the butter. Once it is melted and frothy, add the sweet, smoked, and hot paprika along with the garlic powder, white pepper, and crushed red pepper. Stir the mixture into the butter for 30 seconds and then toss to coat the mushrooms completely in the spice mixture.

## Cook the rice:

* Add the carnaroli rice to the mushrooms and toss to coat. Season everything lightly with salt.

## Cook the risotto:

* Add 1 cup of warm water or stock to the rice and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and stir to agitate the rice.
* For the next 3035 minutes. alternate adding water or stock and stirring the rice until the liquid becomes thick and the rice softens. Stirring the risotto regularly will allow the rice to release starch and thicken the liquid but stirring too much will add air to the risotto and make it gluey, so no need to stir every second during cooking!
* Once the liquid has been absorbed and the risotto is thick and creamy, turn off the heat. Taste the risotto once more and season again to your preferences.

## Melt the manchego cheese:

* Off the heat, stir the manchego cheese into the risotto until melted.

## To serve:

2021-08-24,16,"Cheese Hotteok (Korean Stuffed Pancakes)","yellowjacquet","# Cheese Hotteok

Hotteok are Korean pancakes that are typically stuffed with a sweet filling made of nuts and brown sugar, but this savory twist makes for a delicious appetizer or snack rather than dessert!

When choosing a cheese for this dish I wanted something that would have a nice gooey texture when melted, so American and Mozzarella came to mind. I stuffed half with American cheese (1 slice each) and half with shredded mozzarella (2 tbsp each). Both were absolutely delicious and the cheese melted to a perfect texture! I dont use American cheese for much, but I have to say it really shines in this application! You can definitely sub in your favorite cheese for this recipe but I highly recommend these two!

Instructions are in the notes for how to freeze these for later! I think they make for a great grab and go breakfast item so Im already dreaming up what other savory goodness I can stuff in there!

# Ingredients

* 2 cups all purpose flour
* ½ cup sweet rice flour (glutinous rice flour)
* 1 packet (2 tsp) active dry yeast
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* 8 slices of cheese, or 1 cup shredded cheese (recommend American or mozzarella)
* Veggie oil

# Instructions

1. In a small bowl combine the yeast, sugar, and ¼ cup warm water. Set aside for 5 minutes until frothy.
2. Meanwhile, combine the flour, rice flour, and salt in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Add 1 tbsp of the oil, 1 cup of warm water, and the yeast mixture. Knead together until the dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky to the touch, but pulls away from a clean hand. If the dough is too sticky add more flour 1 tbsp at a time until the proper texture is reached. If the dough is too dry add more water 1-2 tbsp at a time. See picture for ideal dough texture (on instagram because I can only post one pic here).
3. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rest somewhere warm until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
4. Once ready, punch the dough down then divide into 8 even balls. Let the dough rest again for another 15 minutes.
5. Take a dough ball and shape it into 5 flat disk. Spoon 2 tbsp of shredded cheese into the center (or place a folded slice of cheese). Fold the edges in towards the center and seal the dough, creating a filled disk (see progress photos for this step on [i](https://www.instagram.com/craftycookbook/?igshid=et7z4gbq8uva)nstagram, I can only post one pic here). Repeat for each dough ball.
6. Warm 2 tbsp of oil over medium heat. Once hot, add 2-3 hotteok to the pan. Cook for 1 minute on each side (until golden brown) use the back of an oiled spatula to press down on them as they cook so they spread slightly. Remove to a paper towel lined plate and repeat until theyre all cooked, adding more oil to the pan as needed.

# Notes

* Serve immediately. Leftovers can be reheated in a skillet or the microwave. To freeze -  allow them to cool completely then wrap each in foil. Store in a zip bag in the freezer. To reheat place in an oven set to 400 F until warmed through, about 15 minutes.
* The recipe calls for both regular white flour as well as sweet rice flour. Sweet rice flour (the main ingredient in mochi) may be difficult to find in a regular American grocery store, but will be available at any Asian grocery store. Its also available on Amazon!

Ingredients

- 1/2 cup salted butter (113 g)

- 1/2 tsp ground sage

- 2 cups all-purpose flour (250 g)

- 1 tbsp white granulated sugar

- 1 tbsp baking powder

- 1/4 tsp salt

- 1 tsp black pepper

- 1/2 cup grated parmesan (50 g)

- 1/2 cup diced ham (70 g)

- 3/4 cup buttermilk (175 ml)

Directions

1) In a medium saucepan, cook butter over medium heat until melted and browned, stirring constantly. It should take about 4 minutes. You will see it change color and aroma with brown bits forming at the bottom. Pour into a bowl.

2) Whisk ground sage into the browned butter and freeze until cold and solid (about the same texture as when you took it out the fridge). This will take about 30-45 minutes.

3) Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

3) Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl.

4) Take your chilled, browned butter out of the freezer and scrape out of the bowl and into the flour mixture.

5) Using a pastry cutter or your fingertips, break the butter up into small pieces and coat them in the flour. It should resemble coarse crumbs or pebble-sized bits. Work quickly so the butter does not melt.

6) Toss in the parmesan and diced ham.

7) Stir in buttermilk to form a shaggy dough.

8) Pour your dough onto a lightly floured surface and bring together into one mass with your hands.

9) Flatten the mass of dough into an 8-inch circle that is about 1-inch thick. Try to get it as even as you can.

10) Using a knife or bench scraper, cut the circle of dough like a pizza into 8 wedges.

11) Place the wedges of dough onto the baking sheet. Remember to space them at least an inch apart and brush each one with milk or egg wash.

12) Bake for 16-18 minutes until scones are well-browned and crisp on top and no longer doughy. Serve warm.",1971
2021-08-24,3,"Creamy Lemon Bars","cookingsheri","*Ingredients*  
**CRUST**

* 1 cup  graham cracker crumbs (about 8 full crackers)
* 3 Tablespoons  unsalted butter, melted 

**FILLING**

* 6 ounces  brick-style cream cheese,  room temperature
* ¾ cup plain Greek yogurt, at room temperature
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature
* 1/3 cup granulated sugar
* 1/3 cup  fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)
* 1 Tablespoon lemon zest
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

*Instructions*

1. Preheat oven to 300°F . Line the bottom and sides of an 8 or 9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil or parchment, leaving an overhang on all sides to easily lift the bars out of the pan before cutting. Set aside.
2. Make the crust: Mix the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a medium bowl until combined. Evenly press crust into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.
3. Make the filling: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute. On medium-high speed, beat in yogurt until completely combined. Then beat in the eggs and egg yolk until combined. Finally, beat in the sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract until everything is combined and no lumps remain.
4. Pour filling onto the crust. Bake for 28-32 minutes or until the center of the bars no longer jiggles (remove from the oven and gently wiggle the pan to check). Allow the bars to cool at room temperature set on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill for 3-4 hours or even overnight.
5. Once chilled, lift the foil out of the pan using the overhang on the sides and cut into squares.

2021-08-24,9,"Pasta alla Norma (ish!)","BushyEyes","When I was in Rome, I visited Tram Tram and fell in love with the orecchiette alla norma. Its not on the menu currently, but it was orecchiette in a red sauce and topped with small pieces of pan-fried eggplant. It was then topped with grated ricotta salata (the traditional way to serve pasta alla norma!). I didnt have ricotta salata, so I omitted it for this recipe.

For the eggplant, you can follow the Ottolenghi approach to peeling which involves alternating peeling off strips so the eggplant ends up looking like a zebra. Or, you can follow the Tram Tram (and my) approach and leave the skin on completely.

This pasta alla norma is a yummy take on pasta with crispy eggplant. Serve it with orecchiette and simple marinara for a delish dinner!

### Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot
* Skillet
* Sieve

### Ingredients

* ¾ pound eggplant trimmed and small-diced
* 2 pounds Roma tomatoes or use 28-ounce canned tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 10 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper more to taste if desired
* 2 tablespoons plant-based or dairy butter
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes optional
* 16 ounces orecchiette or pasta or choice
* 2 tablespoons avocado oil plus more if needed
* 15 fresh basil leaves plus more for garnish
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Prepare the eggplant:

* Transfer the diced eggplant to a sieve over a bowl and season liberally with salt. Set out at room temperature for 30 minutes as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

#### Blanch the tomatoes (if using fresh tomatoes):

* Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes until the skin splits. Transfer the tomatoes to an ice bath for 5 minutes. Once the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, remove the skins and the cores. Crush lightly with your hands and transfer to a bowl.

#### Prepare the sauce:

* Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring regularly, for 6-8 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

#### Simmer the sauce:

* Melt the butter into the garlic and onions. Once frothy, add the crushed tomatoes and mash lightly with a wooden spoon. Season with salt and pepper. Add 1/4 cup of water and bring to a boil.
* If using, add the cherry tomatoes to the sauce. Reduce heat and simmer for 35 minutes until reduced and thickened. Taste and season to your preferences.

#### Cook the pasta:

* 15 minutes before the sauce is finished, cook the pasta until al dente. Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta.

#### Cook the eggplant:

* While the pasta cooks, heat 2 tablespoons of avocado oil in a skillet. While you wait for the oil to heat, pat the eggplant dry thoroughly with paper towels.
* Cook the eggplant in batches in the hot oil for 2-3 minutes per side, stirring occasionally, until browned and crispy all over. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent the eggplant from burning. Carefully transfer the eggplant to a paper towel-lined plate.

#### Finish the sauce:

* Lightly mash the cherry tomatoes and add the torn basil to the sauce. Immediately add the pasta and a few splashes of reserved pasta water and toss to coat the pasta with the sauce. Turn off the heat.

#### To serve:

* Divide the pasta between shallow bowls and pile the hot eggplant on top. Garnish with more basil leaves, if desired. Enjoy!

2021-08-22,35,"Polish Wild Mushroom Soup","mienczaczek","The best time of the year is just around the corner and the first fruit of the fungi can be found almost everywhere. The high humidity and cold temperatures of this season work in favour of mycelium, bringing us a vast variety of delicious mushrooms. On my short staycation in Lake District, I found a few beautiful Porcini mushrooms that you can see in the picture as well as multiple Larch Boletes referred to in my country as butter mushrooms. They have slimy caps and are perfect for sauces, soups or pickles. As the name suggests Larch Bolete can be found growing in symbiosis with Larch trees starting in July till November.  
  
This is my family recipe for a delicious and filling mushroom soup, perfect after a fungi hunt. It contains pasta and a variety of vegetables that elevate the mushroom flavour. The recipe works with Boletus mushrooms but if not available you can prepare them with chestnut mushrooms instead.  
  
In Poland, mushroom picking is very popular among families and the knowledge is passed from generation to generation. Make sure to always pick mushrooms with someone who knows what they doing, or pick specimens that are hard to confuse, I always recommend signing up for a foraging experience! It is great fun and you can learn something new! :)  
  
This recipe makes 4 portions  
  
  
  
**Ingredients:**  
  
\- 400g (14.1oz) of sliced Boletus mushrooms (or chestnut mushrooms)

\- 1,5L of vegetable stock  
  
\- 150g (5.3oz) of penne pasta  
  
\- 100ml of double cream  
  
\- 1 bay leaf  
  
\- black pepper  
  
\- parsley to garnish  
  
\- 1tsp of yoghurt per plate mixed in before serving (optional)  
  
  
  
**Instructions:**  
  
1.In a frying pan, preheat 1tbsp of olive oil. Add diced onion and 4 sliced garlic cloves, cook on medium heat for 5 minutes or until softened. Add sliced mushrooms with 1tsp of butter and turn up the heat to medium-high, cook for another 5 minutes. Once mushrooms are done remove from the heat and set aside ready for later.  
  
2.In a large pot add 1,5L of vegetable stock, carrots, celery, leek, potato and bay leaf. Bring to the boil and reduce to simmer. Cook for 10 minutes.  
  
3.Next, add 150g of penne pasta and cook for another 10 minutes.

5.At this point, pasta should be cooked through and mushrooms should hold the shape, if the soup seems too thick add a little bit more water.  
  
6.Take one ladle of soup with no solids out of the pot and mix it with 100ml of double cream. Pour the mixture back to the pot. (This prevents the cream from splitting)  
  
7.Check the seasoning and serve garnished with freshly cracked black pepper and chopped parsley. You can mix in 1tsp of yoghurt just before serving to increase the sourness to your liking. Enjoy!

""	`1 tsp salt

""	`1 tsp black pepper

""	`2 tsp white granulated sugar

""	`2 tbsp baking powder

""	`1 cup shedded cheddar (113 g)

""	`1 cup sour cream (227 g)

""	`1/4 cup milk or buttermilk (60 ml)

Directions

1.	`Pre-heat your oven to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C).
2.	`In a bowl, whisk together flour, salt, pepper, sugar, and baking powder.
3.	`Add in your cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingertips to coat the butter in the flour and break the cubes up into small, pea-sized pieces.
4.	`Stir in your scallions and cheddar.
5.	`Add in your sour cream and milk and mix until you get a shaggy, slightly crumbly dough.
6.	`Pour the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently bring all the pieces together into one mass with your hands.
7.	`Flatten and pat down the dough into a rectangle that is about 3/4 of an inch thick.
8.	`Fold the left third of the rectangular block of dough toward the center and do the same with the right third to create layers.
9.	`Turn the block of dough 90 degrees and flatten into another rectangle. You will repeat these folding and turning steps two more times, ending in a rectangle that is about 3/4 of an inch thick.
10.	`Using a round cutter (2-3 inches), cut out your biscuits from the block of dough and re-roll any scraps until there is no more dough remaining. (Remember not to twist the cutter when pressing into the dough or the biscuits will not rise as much in the oven.) Alternatively, you can cut your block of dough with a knife into square biscuits to minimize scraps and re-rolling.
11.	`Place your biscuits in a greased 9-inch round pan or place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment.
12.	`Brush your biscuits with some milk so they brown nicely in the oven. Alternatively, you can do an egg wash.

\- Mix Flour and Salt together in a large bowl  
\- In another container, mix Milk, Sugar, Yogurt, Vegetable Oil and Instant Yeast  
\- Mix the liquid with the dry ingredients  
\- Combine until all flour is hydrated

\- Knead a few times until not tacky  
\- Leave to proof 1 hour  
\- Divide into 8, and form into balls  
\- leave to rest 10 min  
\- Form each ball into a small frisbee shape, with thick edges and thin middle  
\- Leave to proof 20 Min  
\- Poke holes into the middle to deflate  
\- Add Onion Topping and a pinch of Chinese 5 spice  
\- Brush Green Onion Oil on the edges  
\- Bake for 15 Min at 180C

. 

Notes:  
- This is basically a no knead recipe, there is barely and mixing and kneading involved, which is a plus for me. The gluten forms during the resting phases of the recipe  
- The poking of holes is a necessary step. The green onion flavour just seeps through those holes and becomes one with the bread  
- If possible, Make the green onion oil first and then use the oil for the dough as well, it will taste better and more onion-y

Calories: 625kcal

## Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot
* Colander
* Immersion blender

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds fresh ripe tomatoes, cored and roughly chopped
* 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 10 cloves garlic peeled and crushed
* 1 shallot peeled and sliced into wedges
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper trimmed and sliced into rounds
* 16 ounces spaghetti 1 cup pasta cooking water reserved
* Salt to taste

## Instructions

## Sizzle the aromatics:

* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the garlic and allow it to sizzle in the oil for 30 seconds.
* Add the shallot and red Fresno chili pepper. Tilt the pan toward you and base the aromatics in oil for 1-2 minutes until very fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.

## Cook the tomatoes:

* Add the tomatoes to the oil and stir to incorporate. Add a big pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 25-30 minutes until thickened and reduced. Add a splash of water, if necessary, if the tomatoes stick or reduce too quickly. Taste and season to your preferences.

## Cook the pasta:

* Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente. Scoop out 1 cup of the pasta water and set it aside.
* Drain the spaghetti and set aside. Note: Time this so the sauce has finished simmering before the spaghetti is done cooking.

## Finish the pomodoro sauce:

* Add half of the reserved pasta cooking water to the tomato sauce and stir to incorporate. Use an immersion blender to blend the sauce until completely smooth. Taste and season to your preferences.

## Serve the spaghetti:

* Add the spaghetti to the sauce and toss to coat. Add more of the pasta cooking water, as necessary, to loosen up the sauce and to help the sauce stick to the spaghetti. Turn off the heat.
* Divide the spaghetti between plates and serve with your choice of garnishes, such as fresh basil, parsley, or grated parmesan cheese. Enjoy!

I made them too big I think, so I rolled them progressively smaller as the previous batch finishes up from the deep fryer.

Couple of other things I did differently was use brown/raw sugar and ran it through the coffee grinder to make them finer and also mix in a 7g sachet of yeast mixed with the 2 cups of plain flour which is essentially self-raising flour I guess, before mixing in the wet ingredients. The resulting dough was very wet in my case (used yoghurt).

The sugar/cinnamon coating also went through the grinder and just rolled that around kind of slowly in different directions together with the donuts inside this covered container. Came out evenly coated.

Crust

- 2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (320 g)
- 1/2 cup white granulated sugar (100 g)
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 3/4 cup olive oil (177 ml)
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract

Cranberry Jam

- 1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries (110 g)
- 1/2 cup white granulated sugar (100 g)
- 1/4 cup water (59 ml)

Lemon Curd

- 6 large eggs
- 1 3/4 cup white granulated sugar (350 g)
- 7 tbsp all-purpose flour (56 g)
- 3 medium lemons, zested
- 1 cup lemon juice (236 ml)
- 1/4 tsp salt

Directions

1) Pre-heat your oven to 325° F. Line a 9×9 inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil.
2) For the crust, whisk together your flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Add in your olive oil and vanilla and stir until a lumpy dough forms. Press into an even layer across the bottom of the pan.
3) Bake for 40-45 minutes or until crust is mostly firm and golden-brown.
4) Meanwhile, in a saucepan, simmer the cranberries with the sugar and water over moderately low heat until the berries pop and the liquid thickens, about 8 minutes. It should have a jammy consistency. Transfer to a bowl to cool and set aside.
5) Combine all ingredients for the lemon curd in a separate bowl and whisk until smooth.
6) When the crust has finished its cook time, take the baking pan out the oven. Spread your cranberry jam evenly across the crust. Carefully pour the lemon mixture on top forming a separate layer. Then place back into the oven. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until the curd has just a slight jiggle in the center.
7) Take out the oven and let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then place in the fridge to chill completely. When ready to serve, lift out using the parchment paper or foil and cut into individual lemon bars.

2021-08-13,31,"Crispy Zucchini Fritters filled with Ham and Cheese","rodza777","Zucchini has a pretty neutral flavour so it's not prominent in this recipe, ham and cheese make it more delicious. It tastes savoury with a subtle hint of zucchini. Texture is key in this recipe - the golden crust is where much of the flavour is.

**INGREDIENTS:**

* 4 pcs zucchini
* 2 eggs
* 1 onion
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 200 ml of milk
* 150 g flour
* 100 g cheese
* dill
* 100 g Ham

***Sauce***

* 1 clove of garlic
* 150 g sour cream
* 1/4 lemon
* Dill

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Grate zucchini using a box grater. Grate on the diagonal so you get long strands., add salt (1 tsp) -&gt; leave it for a while
2. Squeeze out excess water using hands (or bundle up tea towel)
3. Cut ham and add cheese (any) -&gt; add ham and cheese on top of zucchini
4. Add two eggs, make a mass -&gt; add milk -&gt; mix well
5. Pour into zucchini -&gt; add flour
6. Cut onion and dill -&gt; add to zucchini -&gt; mix all the ingredients

**TIPS:**

1. It's important to squeeze out water from zucchini otherwise you will not get a nice form like in the video. This the way how to avoid soggy insides + achieve those crispy outsides is to wring out the excess liquid from the zucchini.

\- 300g all purpose flour

\- 12g sugar

\- 4g salt

\- 150ml warm milk (\~90°F)

\- 3g yeast

\- 1 large egg

\- 2 tbsps melted butter

\- 6 fully cooked sausages

&amp;#x200B;

[A tutorial video can be found here.](https://youtu.be/7QdawOX8v7g)

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk. Mix the salt, sugar, flour and milk together. Add one egg and mix well. Cover the dough and let it rest for 20 min.
2. Add 2 tbsps melted butter, knead the dough until it's smooth (This step took me about 5 min).
3. Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place (80-90°F) for about 1 hour or until it expands to twice its original size.
4. Knead the dough, remove the air bubbles until the size of the dough is almost the same as before the rise. Divide the dough into six pieces evenly.
5. Shape each piece into a ball shape. You can achieve this by folding the edge to the center and repeat this step. Cover all six pieces with a plastic wrapper or a piece of cloth to prevent them from drying out. Let them rest for 15 min.
6. How to make the bear's paw shape: Flatten the dough into an elliptical shape, make sure the dough is as wide as the sausage or you can trim the sausage to an ideal length. Place the sausage in the middle, fold the dough, and make four even cuts on the sausage. Flip/twist the cut to leave the sausage side up.
7. Final proof in a warm environment for 30 min. Brush on a thin layer of the egg wash. Decorate with a piece of ham in the center of the bear's palm. Bake for 18-20 min at 375°F.",1558

**Directions:**

1.	`In a bowl mix together all ingredients listed in Batter for Veg Crispy using very little water at a time as the batter needs to be thick enough to coat the vegetables. In a vessel heat oil on medium flame for deep frying. The oil shouldnt be very hot as the vegetables are raw and need to cook through. If you keep the flame to low then the vegetables will absorb the oil.
2.	`Mix the vegetables a batch at a time in the batter. Dont mix the different vegetables together as each type requires different amount of time to get thoroughly cooked. For instance finish all cauliflower florets first, then the potatoes and so on.
3.	`Once the oil is hot, drop in the vegetables one by one leaving gaps between them. Dont overcrowd by putting to many vegetables at a time because they will stick to each other.
4.	`Fry on medium flame, after 2 mins turn them over and move them around with a spoon so that they fry from all sides evenly. Do not stir continuously as the batter may come out.
5.	`When you move them around you will find the vegetables have become light and are easily being moved, that means your vegetables are done. You can always remove one on a paper towel and check to decide if you would like to cook it longer.

2021-08-12,15,"Shaved zucchini, burrata and orange tartine","notdotmia","**Ingredients (Serves 2)**

* 2 balls of burrata, 125g each (I used buffalo mozzarella filled with buffalo ricotta)
* 2 thick slices of bread (anything sturdy, crusty and flavoursome works well - I picked a whole wheat and spelt sourdough bread with walnuts)
* 2 small or 1 large golden zucchini
* 1 navel orange
* 1 lemon
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* 1 tsp balsamic vinegar
* 1 tsp honey (or sub with orange jam)
* 2 tbsp olive oil, plus more for assembly
* Fresh basil\*
* Salt

**Instructions**

* Toast your bread slices lightly and set aside.
* Zest half the orange and half the lemon, then julienne 2 medium basil leaves and add them to a large bowl. Add 1 tbsp of lemon juice, the balsamic vinegar, dijon mustard, honey or jam, olive oil and a small pinch of salt. Mix well and set aside (the mixture wont emulsify completely, thats fine).
* Top and tail the zucchini then slice into long, thin strips with a mandolin, vegetable peeler or a sharp knife. Stop when you get closer to the core as the part with seeds wont hold its shape well (save these bits for snacking). Add the strips to the bowl with the vinaigrette and toss until well covered. The zucchini will soften a bit as it sits in the mix.
* Peel the orange and cut into slices or segments, removing as much of the pith as possible to avoid its bitter taste.
* Drizzle the toasted bread with a bit of olive oil, then tear the burrata balls in half and place one on each bread slice.
* At this stage, you can taste a strip of zucchini to test for seasoning. If the salad is to your liking, pile it on top of the burrata in twisted ribbons, alternating with the orange slices.
* Top with small basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve immediately.

**Notes**

* This recipe can also be done with mozzarella or creamy goats cheese instead of burrata.
* You can pick which fresh herbs to use according to taste and availability - basil is my favourite for this recipe, but thyme and mint are also good options.
* Passion fruit pulp goes really well in the vinaigrette, with its sweet-tart freshness - if you happen to have some on hand, I recommend adding in a tablespoon of the pulp (seeds in if you like the crunch, I prefer straining).

**Ingredients**

*Fried Chicken*

* 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
* 1 C Buttermilk
* 1/4 C Hot Sauce (Like Franks Red Hot)
* 1/4 C Pickle Juice
* 2 Tbsp Salt
* 2 Tbsp Garlic Powder
* 2 Tbsp Ground Cayenne Pepper
* 1 C All Purpose Flour
* 1 C Corn Starch
* Fry Oil (e.g. vegetable, canola, peanut) -enough to fill frying pot halfway
* Buns and topping of your choice

*Blue Cheese Dressing*

* 3/4 Cup Mayonnaise 
* 1/2 Cup Sour Cream
* 5oz Crumbled Blue Cheese
* 1 Large Garlic Clove - Minced 
* Juice of 1 Lemon
* 2 Tbsp Chopped Fresh Parsley
* Salt and Pepper to Taste

*Buffalo Sauce*

* 1/2 C Butter
* 1/2 C Hot Sauce (Franks, Texas Pete, Louisiana, etc.)
* 1 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce
* 1 Tbsp Fresh Lemon Juice 


**Preparation**

* Trim excess fat from your chicken and place in a bowl with the buttermilk, hot sauce, pickle juice, 1 Tbsp salt, 1 Tbsp garlic powder, and 1 Tbsp cayenne. Mix well, seal and place in the fridge for ~4 hours (or overnight). You can marinate for less time but it wont be as flavorful.

* Combine the blue cheese dressing ingredients and place in the fridge at least 1 hour before use.

* When you are ready to bread and fry the chicken, remove chicken from the refrigerator and begin heating your oil in a large heavy bottom pot to 350 degrees F. Never fill your pot more than 1/2-2/3 of the way full! 

* In a large bowl, mix together the flour, cornstarch, 1 Tbsp salt, 1 Tbsp cayenne, and 1 Tbsp garlic powder. Then drizzle 1/4 C of the buttermilk marinade into the dry ingredients and mix. This creates little pieces that will stick to your chicken and give it a rough exterior that gets really crunchy! THIS IS THE GOOD STUFF.

* Drip off any excess marinade and place chicken in flour and make sure each piece is thoroughly coated. Shake off any excess flour. For a thicker breading, place the chicken back into the buttermilk marinade and coat in flour again. 

* Carefully place your chicken into the oil and fry for 3-5 minutes or until a very light golden brown. Pull them out and set on a wire rack for 10 minutes. During this time, heat up your oil to 375 degrees F.

* Fry the chicken again at the higher temperature just for a few minutes or until they become a nice golden brown color. Place on a wire wrack and salt immediately. Allow to cool for 3-5 minutes.

* While your chicken is cooling, make your buffalo sauce by combining the ingredients in a sauce pan over low heat. Make sure not to over heat because the sauce will break. But if it does, allow it to completely cool to room temp and whisk it vigorously.

* Toss the chicken in the buffalo sauce and assemble your sandwich with the blue cheese and any other toppings your prefer (I like bread and butter pickles!). Enjoy!",2828

### Instructions

#### Prepare the aromatics:

* Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wide pot over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often for 5-6 minutes until it begins to turn translucent. Add the red Fresno chili pepper and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.
* Turn the heat to low and allow the onions to simmer in the oil as you finish the pasta and the pesto. Stir the onions occasionally to prevent them from burning.

#### Prepare the pesto:

* Combine the pistachios, pine nuts, and garlic in a food processor and pulse until finely minced.
* Add the arugula in batches and continue pulsing until all of the arugula is minced.
* Slowly pour in the extra virgin olive oil and pulse until smooth. Add the basil leaves and continue pulsing until everything is incorporated and finely minced. Add more extra virgin olive oil, if needed. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.

#### Finish the pasta:

* Turn the heat on the aromatics to medium-high. Add half the pasta cooking water and bring it to a boil. Allow it to reduce and thicken for 2-3 minutes. Add the cooked pasta and turn the heat to low, and toss to coat.
* Immediately add the pesto and continue tossing gently to coat the pasta with the pesto. Add more pasta cooking water, as needed, to loosen up the saucetaste and season to your preferences. Turn off the heat.

2021-08-09,6,"Kung Pao Chicken","cookingwithRobin","Kung Pao chicken is one of the worlds most popular Chinese dishes and it's made with stir fried chicken, peanuts, and chili peppers. This dish can be found throughout China and there are several regional variations. My favorite is the Sichuan version which is actually not that spicy.

&amp;#x200B;

There are 24 different flavors in Sichuan cuisine, and from this, Kung Pao chicken should taste savory, sour and sweet with a hint of spicy. In Sichuan, we describe it as the lychee flavor. The chicken is tender, glossy, and covered with the lychee sauce, and the roasted peanuts are crunchy and nutty. I hope this dish will introduce you to more Sichuan food that is not limited to super spicy and numbing flavors.

* Good quality extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 sprigs of fresh basil, thinly sliced (leaves only)
* Zest of 1 lemon
* (Optional but recommended) 1 tbsp aged balsamic or balsamic glaze

**Instructions**

* Slice the tomatoes thinly, crosswise, with a serrated knife (around 0.5cm or less). Distribute them on a serving plate and sprinkle with some flaky sea salt and thinly sliced basil leaves.\*
* If using balsamic - drizzle it evenly over the tomatoes at this stage.
* Gently place the burrata ball to the center of the plate on top of the tomatoes.
* Drizzle the burrata and tomatoes with around 2 tbsp of olive oil, then zest around ½ to 1 lemon over the mix. Serve immediately with some crusty bread if desired.

**Notes**

* If using cherry tomatoes, cut them in half or quarters depending on their size. Also, I'd recommend serving in a shallow bowl by placing the burrata ball to the center first and then adding the tomato wedges around it.
* Regular balsamic vinegar doesnt work as well here - whenever I dont have aged balsamic or glaze on hand, I prefer simply omitting it.
* For presentation, I kept my basil leaves whole but its easier to slice them thinly and sprinkle them evenly over the tomatoes.

2021-08-08,6,"Brownie cookie sandwiches with chocolate French buttercream","reddituser246","Recipe for the cookie (from Gimme Some Oven)

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 7 ounces chopped dark chocolate or semisweet chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 2/3 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- optional: flaky sea salt, for sprinkling

1. Heat oven to 350°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.  Before you begin mixing the batter, go ahead and measure and set out all of the ingredients.  This recipe moves quickly, so its important to have everything prepped and ready to go in advance!
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and sea salt until combined.  Set aside.
3. In a saucepan, heat the butter over medium-low heat until melted.  Remove pan from heat.  Add in the chocolate and whisk until it melted and combined.
4. Meanwhile, as the butter/chocolate mixture is heating, combine the eggs, brown sugar and granulated sugar together in a large mixing bowl.  Using a stand mixer or a hand mixer, beat on medium-high speed for 5 minutes.
5. Slowly pour the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, using a rubber spatula to fold in the chocolate mixture until it is just combined.  Add in the dry mixture, again using a rubber spatula to fold it in until just combined.  (Avoid over-mixing.)
6. Quickly, use a large 3-tablespoon cookie scoop or a spoon to drop the batter in balls onto your prepared baking sheet, spaced at least two inches apart.  (The batter will spread significantly as the cookies bake.)  Sprinkle each cookie with a pinch of flaky sea salt, if desired.
7. Immediately transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, until the tops of the cookies are crinkled and slightly domed.  (They will flatten and crinkle a bit more once you remove them from the oven.)  Remove cookies from the oven and transfer the pan to a wire baking rack to cool for 15-20 minutes.

[Recipe for the chocolate French buttercream filling](https://bakerinretrograde.wordpress.com/2021/08/08/easy-chocolate-french-buttercream-small-batch/)

Ingredients

- 3 large egg yolks
- 50 g white granulated sugar (1/4 cup)
- 113 g softened butter (1/2 cup)
- 50 g chopped dark chocolate (about 1/3 cup)
- pinch of salt

Directions

1. In a heatproof bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar to combine.
2. Bring a pot filled with a couple inches of water to a simmer over medium heat.
3. Place bowl containing the egg yolk mixture over the pot of simmering water and continuously whisk the egg yolks and sugar until all the sugar is dissolved. You can rub a bit of the mixture between your fingers to check if there are any granules of sugar still left undissolved.
4. Take the mixture off the pot. Using a mixer on high speed, beat the mixture for several minutes until it becomes pale, thickened and drips down into ribbons when lifting up the beaters. The bottom and sides of the bowl should be cool at this point.
5. While mixing on low speed, add in your softened butter a tablespoon at a time. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary, and you should be left with a smooth, uniform mixture. Troubleshooting: If you have added in all your butter and the mixture seems separated, the butter may have been too cold and not softened enough. You can fix this by placing your frosting mixture over the same pot of simmering water from earlier. Heat the mixture until it just melts around the sides. Beat the mixture again with your mixer until the frosting smoothens out and becomes uniform.
6. Melt and cool down your chopped chocolate and mix it into the rest of your buttercream. (Alternatively, you can flavor your buttercream with a 1/4 tsp of vanilla or almond extract.)
7. Lastly add in a pinch of salt.",3810

* 1 cup of Sugar

* 2 eggs

* 2 tablespoons of Honey

* 2 tablespoons of Butter

* 1 teaspoon of Baking Soda

* 3 cups of Flour

* 1 1/2 cups of Heavy Cream

* 1 1/2 cups of Sour Cream 

* 2-3 tablespoons of Honey 

**Directions**

1. In a saucepan, add the sugar, eggs, honey, and butter. 

2. Mix well, then turn on the fire. Cook this until the sugar dissolves, do not stop mixing so because it burns quickly.

3. Once the sugar has melted add the baking soda, you will notice that it will bubble up keep mixing this for 1 minute then turn off the fire.

4. Add the flour and mix as much as you can.

5. Transfer to a surface so you can continue mixing by hand, be careful it might still be very hot. But it's best to work with dough while warm

6. Once your dough has come together you can weigh it and cut it into 6 to 8 equal pieces. (check tips below to get more ideas) 

7. Roll and flatten each dough piece and cut to the desired shape. Do not throw away the extras, bake them we will use them to decorate.

8. Bake these for around 10 to 15 minutes (maybe a little more), they should be dark golden brown.

9. Once they come out of the oven if your baking sheet isn't flat make sure to move your cookies to somewhere flat (like the countertop or table), because once they cool they will harden and you want a straight cake.

10. The extra pieces that you baked, once cooled place in the food processor until powder-like.

Sour Cream Frosting:
Whip the heavy cream, sour cream, and honey until well mixed (that's it =)

**Ingredients:**  
**Crackers:**  
*40g sunflower seeds*  
*40g pumpkin seeds*  
*30g flax seeds*  
*30g sesame seeds*  
*30g chia seeds*  
*10g poppy seeds*  
*1/2 tsp. coarse salt*

*1 tsp. dried mixed herbs*

*150ml water*

**Orange Peel:**  
*1 large orange*

*1 heaped tbsp. sugar*

*1 heaped tbsp. honey*

*150ml water*

**Goat's Cheese**

*150g soft mild goat's cheese*

*50ml double cream*

**Method:**

1.) Measure out the seeds and place them in a large bowl along with the salt and herbs and mix well. Add the water and stir it all together and set aside to soak for 30 minutes.

1.) Preheat the oven to 150°C Fan (300° F) and line ta 10 x 15 inch baking tray with greaseproof paper.

3.) Spread the sed mixture as evenly as possible across the tray, making sure there are no holes or gaps. Place in the oven for 30 minutes before taking it out and flipping the sheet of seed mix over to bake for a further 10-15 minutes. It should be well dried, crisp and airy, and can be turned over in one piece if careful. You are looking to dry the underside out too, but watch it closely, as it can easily over brown and take on a bitter taste at this stage. Remove the sheet and allow to cool before breaking the crackers into irregular shards.

4.) Peel a large orange and cut the skin lengthways into strips of about 2mm in thickness. Don't go too deep as to peel the white off, just the surface layer. Measure 150ml of water in a small saucepan and set it on the boil before placing the rind in to cook on high for 10 minutes, stirring every so often. Add the juice from 1/4 of the orange. Add the sugar and the honey and continue to stir and cook for a further 10 minutes. The liquid will reduce. When it has cooled, you are hoping for the rind to be softer with a little bit of bite, while the syrup should have thickened up for pouring or drizzling. If the rind is still too hard or you have lost too much liquid, simply add some more water and heat it up to cook a bit more.

5.) Whip the goat's cheese up in a food processor set on high and pour the double cream in. A soft, mild goat's cheese log works best you may have to stop it once or twice to clean the walls down so that the mix can be properly reached by the blades. Make sure it is well whipped and consistent at the end.

6.) assemble the dish. Place dollops of the whipped goat's cheese mouse onto the crackers or pope it through a bag before topping it with the candied orange peel and some of the syrup. A sprinkle of poppy seed and some smoked coarse salt adds another great touch when serving.",3188

1. Mix all the ingredients.  
2. With wet hands make a small ball. Flatten the ball before dropping it into the hot oil.  
3. Deep fry until golden brown on medium flame.  
4. Drain off the excess oil.

If you wanna see me cook it and talk through it, [you can watch me make it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XopHvyPmUc)

### Ingredients

- 2 hotdogs
- 1 habanero
- an inch of ginger
- a bunch of kale (about five stalks worth, but as much as you like)
- a mango

- 4 tablespoons of water.
- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon of honey 

- 1 tablespoon of sesame oil.
- 1 cup of rice
- 1.5 cups of water

### Recipe

- Slice your hotdogs on a diagonal.
- Mince the ginger finely. Deseed the habanero and mince finely half or all of it to taste.
- Remove the stalks from your kale and chop the leaves into medium sized pieces.
- Cut off a slice of mango, crosshatch it and run your knife between the skin and the flesh to remove.
- Mix up the four tablespoons of water, and the soy sauce, rice vinegar and honey for the sauce, and set aside.
- Put a pot on medium heat, add a tablespoon of sesame oil, a cup of rice, fry for a minute or so, then add a cup and a half of water, bring it to a boil, then cover and simmer for about 15 minutes.
- Put a pan on high heat, add two tablespoons of oil, get it shimmering, and throw in your kale. Hit it with a big pinch or two of salt whilst it's frying to draw out the moisture and help it crisp up.
- Once crispy and charred, set the kale aside.
- Turn the pan down to medium high, throw in another two tablespoons of oil, get it shimmering and throw in the hotdogs.
- When they're browned and cripsy on all sides throw in your ginger and habanero, and fry it until it's just fragrant and aromatic.
- Then throw in the sauce, let it bubble, and add another half cup of water. - Reduce the heat to medium/medium low and reduce the sauce until the hotdogs are coated in a sticky glaze. Take care to scrape the bottom of the pan to prevent anything from sticking and burning.
- Once the sauce has reduced to the desired consistency, scoop out a big bowl of rice, top it with the crispy kale, the cubed mango and the hotdogs.",2085

2021-07-30,2,"French Onion and Mushroom Crepe","Pratchettfan03","I came up with this recipe last night. It's only 1 weight watchers point per serving (2 crepes, which fills you up quite a bit), but tastes extremely rich and savory due to nearly every ingredient being strongly savory, and the creaminess of the caramelized onions creating the illusion of fat. This recipe takes a minimum of an hour to make, be forewarned, and the time it takes increases depending on the servings made due to the way that onion caramelization works. I will write the recipe for one serving, so anything more will be via scaling it up

serves: 1

\*\*Ingredients\*\*

* 2 large eggs or extra large eggs
* 1 tbsp. soy sauce
* 1 tbsp. all purpose flour
* 2 large button mushrooms (an equivalent volume of other mushroom can be used), minced
* 1 large onion
* 1 1/2 tsp beef base (preferably better than bouillon)
* salt and pepper to taste
* cooking spray

\*\*Directions\*\*

1. Slice the onion, either by cutting it pole-to-pole, or running it through the slicing attachment on a food processor. Put a large non stick pot or pan over medium high heat, and spray with cooking spray before putting in the onions and sprinkling with salt. Caramelize the onions, stirring frequently, particularly near the end once most of the water has evaporated. This will take a minimum of 45 minutes, but at least when the onions are sweating out their liquid during the middle stage of the process you only need minimal stirring, allowing you to complete the rest of the prep.
2. While the onions are around 30 minutes before completion, in other words just starting to change color, mince the mushrooms. In a non stick crepe pan over medium high heat coated with cooking spray, cook, stirring frequently, and season with salt and pepper. When mushrooms are cooked through but there is still liquid in the pan, remove to a bowl large enough to contain 3 times that volume, liquid included. Immediately stir the beef base into this mixture.
3. In a bowl of equivalent size, whisk together the egg, soy sauce, and flour. If your ratios have been done correctly, the volume of this should be about double the volume of the mushrooms, although there is heavy room for error.
4. When onions are caramel-colored, remove from heat and mix them into the mushroom mixture.
5. Wipe out any remaining mushroom from the crepe pan and heat on medium. Prepare your setup- a large plate in the oven on 'warm' or an equivalent setting, a quarter cup scoop for the crepe batter, a flexible silicon spatula to fold the crepes, and a large soup spoon. If your bowl has volume markings, note how many quarter cups of crepe batter you have, so you know how many crepes to divide your filling among. 
6. Spray pan with cooking spay. Pour in 1/4 cup batter, tilting the pan in a circle to get an even layer. When the mixture no longer runs when you tilt it, deposit either one or two heaping soup spoonfuls of the filling, depending on your definition of a spoonful. when batter is almost completely cooked through, fold your crepe by picking up and folding over each side in turn, as this crepe batter isn't very strong and rips easily. Then, transfer to a plate and repeat until ingredients have run out.

\*\*Notes\*\*

* Do not take shortcuts with ingredients or with the caramelization of the onions. This is an incredibly simple recipe, and all of its flavor comes from technique.
* Be conservative with salt, but not pepper. This is because the soy sauce in the batter adds in salt that you are not aware of until the dish is complete. It is better to have to sprinkle salt on a crepe than to find the crepes completely inedible because you did not account for the soy sauce. For a bit more wiggle room, use low-sodium soy sauce.
* While you could use pans that are not non stick, I do not recommend, except if you are making an enormous quantity of onions, at which point a normal pot will do. The reason why you use nonstick for the crepe pan is because A) it's really difficult to make a crepe in a regular pan because you can't flip or stir, and B) It allows you to cut down on oil, which is good for this recipe's intended purpose of making healthy food feel like a splurge.",4166

* 100g Filet Mignon
* about 50g Rucola Salad
* 20g Pine Nuts
* 1-2tsp Lemon juice
* Balsamic Vinegar
* Olive Oil
* Salt, Pepper
* Parmesan Cheese

* 1/2 Baguette
* Cheese (I used Gouda)

**Directions:**

Put the Filet into the freezer to lightly freeze it so it is a little harder and therefore easier to cut. It should take about 30-45min.

Wash the rucola and dry it as good as possible. Then roast the pine nuts in a small pan.

Coat a plate with a thin layer of balsamic vinegar.

Afterwards cut the Filet into about 2mm thin slices. On a kitchen board you can ""spread"" the meat a little bit by using the knife to brush it out. Alternatively you could cover it with some cling film and hit it with a pan or pot. The meat should be about 1mm thin in the end.

Arrange the filet slices on the Plate. When all slices are on the plate, pour 1-2 tsp of fresh lemon juice over it, then drizzle some extra virgin olive oil, followed by a little bit of balsamic vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.

Put the rucola and the pine nuts on the plate and drizzle some balsamic vinegar over it. As a last step grate some parmesan cheese over it.

Cut the baguette in half and season with salt and pepper. Now grate the Cheese and mix it with bacon cubes. Put the mix on the baguette halfes and bake it in the oven at 200C (400F) until the baguette is a light brown and the cheese melted.",1424

**Directions:**    

Brista (Crispy Fried Onions)    
1. In a vessel on medium heat put 5 tbs oil, once its hot, add the thinly sliced onions and fry them stirring occasionally until all sides are a little less than dark brown.    

2. Make sure you dont burn them. (In fact you should remove them a bit earlier before it can turn dark brown while frying because while sitting on the paper towel they will cook a tad bit because of the hot oil it will have over it).    

3. Remove them on a paper towel so that the excess oil has been soaked up by it.    

4. Once cooled you need to crush them using your hands to make it a fine powder.    

5. And set aside to be used in the curry.    

6. In the same vessel, using the same oil on medium heat add the bay leaf and the thick paste that you have ground earlier    
7. Fry for 5 mins adding a little water at a time. Then add the crushed fried onion (brista) that you made and had set aside. Add the potatoes as well    
8. Keep frying by adding little water at a time until the oil separates and comes up    
9. Then add the chicken pieces and fry on high flame until the chicken water dries up    
10. When you notice the colour of the chicken pieces have changed then add the tomato puree    
11. Let it cook on medium flame for 5 mins until the water of the tomato dries up    
12. Add some salt as per your requirement    
13. Now add water until the chicken and potato have been covered completely    
14. Cover and cook on slow flame until the chicken and the potato have been cooked thoroughly    
15. You can even adjust the water as per the consistence you desire. I have kept it medium which is not a dry gravy and not to runny as seen in the picture above    
16. Lastly garnish with coriander leaves and serve it with Cumin rice/ plain rice/ bread/ roti which ever you may desire",2773

**Ingredients:**

Dough:

\- 300g all-purpose flour

\- 2g salt

\- 2 tbsps (30ml or 15g) oil

\- 1 egg

\- 100ml water

Filling:

\- 300g boneless lamb leg

\- 1/2 red onion

\- 1.5 tsps salt

\- 1 tsp black pepper

\- 2 tsps cumin

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Mix the flour, salt, oil, egg, and water together to form a dough and roughly knead it for about 2 minutes. Cover it with a lid and let it rest for half an hour.
2. Dice the meat to the size of a corn kernel. The seasoning is very simple, just salt, black pepper, and cumin. This will highlight the original fragrance of lamb, and the cumin will add a touch of barbecue taste. Mix well and set it aside for later use.
3. Knead the dough until it is smooth. Divide the dough into 12 pieces evenly.
4. Roll out the dough to a round shape, ideally 7 to 8 inches in diameter. Place the filling in the center and fold the dough to a rectangular shape. Gently seal the seam.
5. Place all the samsas on a baking sheet, seam side down. Brush on a thin layer of the egg wash and decorate them with some sesame seeds.
6. Bake for 25 minutes at 400^(o)F. Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. One trick is to roll out the dough twice using a rolling pin. Roll out the dough to the size of your palm and thin out the edge during the first roll, you will feel some resistance because the dough is not fully relaxed yet. Set it aside and work on the next one. After you are done with the first six pieces, come back and roll the dough out for the second time. Youll see that the dough is elastic and very easy to work with.
2. The egg wash will help the skin to secure the moisture so it wont crack during baking.

1/2 tsp coarse sea salt (or to taste)  
2 Tbsp seaweed (optional)  
1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes (optional)  


**INSTRUCTIONS**   


* Cut one sheet of dried seaweed (nori) in half with scissors and cut it in about 1-1/23 strips.  

* Soak the seaweed in water for a couple of minutes.  

* Squeeze out excess water and set aside.  

* Cut the tuna into 3/4 cubes and mix with all other ingredients in a large bowl.  

* Cover the bowl and put in the refrigerator for a minimum of 15 minutes but no longer than 2 hours.

  
**Poke (Bowl) Serving Suggestions**  


* If served as an appetizer, I like to place the poke on Asian soup spoons. Its the perfect way to enjoy this simple yet impressive and refreshing dish.  

* When served as a main course, place some white rice in a bowl and top with poke and a couple of avocado slices.   

* Tip: When serving poke over rice, make sure that your rice has cooled down to room temperature before adding the poke. Otherwise, your tuna will start to cook.",1430

2021-07-27,4,"Easiest Veggie Okonomiyaki","notdotmia","If you're looking for the traditional Okonomiyaki recipe, this one isn't it - but it's perfect if you've got cabbage and other pantry staples at hand to make an easy version on a shoestring. I love serving them with gyoza and/or noodles!

**Ingredients for fritters (Serves 2 as a side dish)**

* 3 cups shredded napa or white cabbage (about ½ medium head)
* 3 green onions, thinly sliced
* 3 tbsp plain flour
* 3 large eggs, lightly beaten
* ½ tsp salt
* 1 tsp sugar
* ½ tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* Vegetable oil

**Ingredients for sauce (alternate version below, sans Worcestershire and oyster sauce)**

* 3 tbsp ketchup
* 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1½  tbsp oyster sauce
* 1 tbsp sugar

**Toppings &amp; Garnishes**

* Japanese mayo
* Thinly sliced nori (I cut them into thin strips with a pair of sharp kitchen shears)
* Toasted sesame seeds
* Thinly sliced green onions
* Hot sauce (optional)

**Instructions**

* In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, green onions, flour, salt and sugar. In another bowl, combine the eggs with the soy sauce and sesame oil, then add to the cabbage mixture and mix until combined. The mixture will look thin, that's normal.
* Heat a nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat and add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom. When the oil is hot, add between ¼-½ cup of mixture to the pan for each fritter, flattening gently with a spatula and cooking for 3-4 minutes per side until browned. Reduce the heat to low or put the lid on if needed to help the pancake cook fully. Repeat with the remaining mixture, giving it a toss before each scoop, adding more oil as needed.
* While the fritters are cooking, combine all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
* Serve the okonomiyaki with dipping sauce, japanese mayo and hot sauce (if desired). Top with sesame seeds, nori and green onions.

**Notes**

* Recipe for alternate dipping sauce:  
1½ tbsp tomato ketchup  
2 tbsp soy sauce  
2 tsp white vinegar  
1 tsp sesame oil  
1 tsp sugar  
1 small clove of garlic, grated
* Leftovers keep well in the fridge for a few days and can be served either hot or cold.

*INGREDIENTS:*

\- lime juice \[1 cup / 250 ml\]

\- orange juice \[2 tbsp / 30 ml\]

\- red onion \[medium-size\]

\- one normal tomato

\- cherry tomatoes \[5 oz / 150 gram\]

\- ketchup \[1-2 tbsp\]

\- one green or red (bell) pepper \[small-size\]

\- cilantro \[a handful\]

\- shrimp meat \[0.5 lbs / 220 gram\]

\- salt \[to taste\]

Servings: 4

*INSTRUCTIONS:*

1. Slice onion in thin long stripes. Don't dice it! Let onions soak in salt water for 15 minutes
2. Process your sweet cherry tomatoes into a juicy mass. If not sweet/tasty enough for your taste, add 1-2 tbsp of ketchup
3. Dice the tomato and red pepper in small cubes. Chop the fresh cilantro
4. Press out the lime juice. You will need approximately one cup \[250ml\], enough to cover the shrimp meat
5. Clean and peel your shrimp down to its meat and, even though controversial for ceviche, we suggest that you poach it in boiling saltwater for 2 minutes. Simply to be 100% safe. Immediately transfer the cooked shrimp in ice-cold water, which will quickly stop the cooking process and help your shrimp to stay tender.
6. Cut the shrimp into small bite-size pieces and transfer into a **glass** bowl
7. Pour in lime juice and add all other ingredients. Sprinkle with the juice of half an orange and salt to taste
8. Mix thoroughly and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit in fridge for 1-2 hours
9. Serve with plantain chips, or if you can't find those, tortilla nacho chips go well with it, too. Enjoy!

**Ingredients**  
Celery seed crust  
\- ½ cup unsalted butter cold and cut into small cubes  
\- 1 ¼ cup all purpose flour  
\- 1 tsp celery seed  
\- 1 tsp salt  
\- 4-5 tbsp cold water

\- 4 ounces chevre  
\- 4 eggs  
\- 2 cups heavy cream  
\- 1 teaspoon salt  
\- ¼ teaspoon sugar  
\- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper  
\- 1 leek thinly sliced  
\- 1 pound Asparagus trimmed of tough ends  
\- 2 tablespoons olive oil  
\- 1 cup frozen peas  
\- Salt and pepper to taste  
**Instructions**  
1. Prep the pie crust at least 30 minutes in advance. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, celery seed, and salt. Add cold butter, and using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut the butter into the flour until there are only small, peas sizes pieces of butter visible in the flour. Next add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing with your hand or a spatula after each addition, until the dough begins to stick together. Using your hands, form the dough into a flat disk. Cover with plastic wrap, and chill at least 30 minutes.  
2. Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss asparagus with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper. Roast until slightly fork tender, about 10-15 minutes. Once the asparagus is out of the oven, raise the temp to 425°F.  
3. Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat in a medium skillet. Add leeks and a pinch of salt, and sauté until softened and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add frozen peas, and sauté until thawed completely, another 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.  
4. On a floured surface, roll out the dough until it's large enough to line a 9 inch round pie pan. Line pie pan with pie dough, prick bottom with a fork several times, then crumble half of the goat cheese and spread along bottom. Next add leeks and peas and spread evenly throughout the dish. Then crumble the rest of the goat cheese. Lastly arrange asparagus on top of the fillings.  
5. Add eggs to a mixing bowl, and beat slightly. Then add heavy cream, 1 teaspoon salt, sugar, and cayenne and whisk to combine. Pour egg mixture evenly over other ingredients in the pie dish.  
6. Bake at 425°F for 15 minutes. Then lower the temperature to 300°F and bake 35-40 minutes, or until set with just a slight wobble in the middle.

40 g (3 tbsp) vegetable oil

45 g (3 tbsp) milk

60 g (½ cup) cake flour

20 g (3 tbsp) cocoa powder

45 g (3 tbsp) hot water

4 egg white

1/8 tsp table salt

80 g (6 tbsp) granulated sugar

40 g (2½ tbsp) hot whipping cream

1/2 tbsp instant coffee

60 g (2 oz) white chocolate, chopped small

300 g (1¼ cup) cold whipping cream

**Instructions:**

*-- Chocolate cake --*

1. Whisk egg yolks and oil until well-combined. Add milk and mix well. Add sifted flour in two batches and mix after every addition.
2. In a separate bowl, combine cocoa powder and hot water. Then add it into the cake batter and mix well. Cover and set aside.
3. Place egg white and salt in a large clean bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat them until foamy with tiny bubbles on high speed. Lower the speed and gradually add sugar in small batches with the mixer running. After all is mixed in, increase the speed to high and beat to a stiff peak consistency.
4. Add 1/3 of beaten egg white into the cake batter. Mix with a whisk until combined. Add another 1/3 portion and carefully fold the mixture until almost combined. Combine cake batter with the remaining egg white. Mix and fold just until combined.
5. Pour the batter into a baking tray that has been lined with parchment paper. I used 9.5""x 14.5"" (24cm x 37cm) baking tray. Spread the batter evenly with a scraper. Then tap twice onto the counter to release any big air bubbles.
6. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) for 20 minutes.

8. Flip the cake over and peel off the bottom paper. Trim all of the edges. Then cut the cake crosswise into 3 equal pieces. Set aside.

*-- Coffee cream --*

1. Dilute instant coffee into the hot cream. Pour the hot mixture into white chocolate to melt it. If the chocolate is not fully melted, put the chocolate bowl over a pot of simmering water on the stove. Heat until completely melted. Set aside to cool.
2. Using an electric mixer, beat the cold whipping cream until thickened. Add the melted chocolate and beat again until it reaches a stiff peak consistency.

*-- Assembly --*

1. Spread the coffee cream evenly onto the first cake layer. Add the second layer of cake and another layer of coffee cream. Add the final layer of cake and decorate the top with the remaining coffee cream. Run a spatula along the sides if any excess cream comes out.

This has been one of my favorite recipes from the book! 5/5 There is a cool refreshing mix of flavors with the mint, and the lemony dressing that make it absolutely perfect for a summer day. 

I did have to make one pretty major adjustment to the recipe though. Sumac is not widely available in my region, so I had to look for a decent substitute. What i found is that sumac is said to have a slightly sour, lemony taste, so lemon pepper seasoning was my chosen substitute. I halved the amounts listed for the sumac since it is a lighter flavor. I also subbed dried mint for fresh, and still enjoyed the result.",1529

You can cut down on the cheese to save calories if you use strong cheese like the hard varieties or the sharp cheeses (like extra sharp cheddar).  I also put the oven on broil for 2 minutes at the end, just to brown and crisp up the cheese.

Happy to hear that my recipe is useful :) I appreciate your time and comment.   
  
As for your ingredients you're absolutely right you can make it with less calories by switching on yogurt with 0% and using the regular sour cream.

**INGREDIENTS**  
17.3 oz box of Pepperidge Farm puff pastry sheets (2 sheets), thawed  
2 c peaches, diced (canned peaches in light syrup)  
2 c mangoes, diced  
5 Tbsp peach syrup (from the can)  
1/4 c granulated sugar  
5 tsp cornstarch  
1 tsp cinnamon  
1/2 tsp ground cloves  
1/2 tsp ground ginger  
2-3 mint leaves, finely minced (about 1 tsp)  
1 large egg (for egg wash)  
Coarse sugar

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTIONS**   


* Start by making the peach mango filling. Add all ingredients (except for egg and coarse sugar) to a pot, over low-medium heat.  

* Stir frequently, until the fruit softens just slightly and the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes.  

* Then, remove from heat and let cool a bit while you prepare the dough and preheat oven to 400°F.  

* On a piece of parchment paper, unfold one sheet of puff pastry dough from the package.  
Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough just slightly, to measure about 123 x 123, then cut into four equal squares.  

* Prepare an egg wash by mixing together one large egg and a few drops of water, and beating with a fork.  

* Brush the egg wash along the edges of each of the squares (this will help seal the dough later on).  

* Next, using a tablespoon, drop about 3 Tbsp of filling into the center of each puff pastry square.  

* Fold over each square into a triangle shape and press down firmly along all of the edges, about 1/43 all the way around. For a decorative element, you can then press all around the edges with the tines of a fork.  

* Using your hand, gently press down on the peach mango fruit filling, to make sure it has spread all throughout the inside of the turnover.  

* Brush egg wash all over the tops and edges of the turnovers, then sprinkle generously with coarse sugar.  

* Finally, lift the parchment paper (with the turnovers on it) to a baking sheet.  

* Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, rotating halfway through to ensure even browning, until the pastry has puffed up with a beautiful golden color.  

* Let cool slightly and serve warm. Enjoy for breakfast and dessert!",2252

**Enjoy the recipe and** [**our United Cuisines show on Youtube!**](https://youtu.be/We6l_FDjZlg)

*INGREDIENTS:*

\- coconut milk \[1.5 cups / 350 ml\]

\- glutinous rice AKA sticky rice \[1.25 cups / 9 oz / 250 g\]

\- sugar \[1/3 cup / 3 oz / 80 g\]- salt \[1.25 tsp / 6 g\]

\- rice or corn starch \[1 tsp / 5 g\]

\- 1 ripe sweet (yellow) mango

\- roasted yellow mung beans or alternatively sesame seeds \[1 tsp / 5 g\]

Servings: 3

*INSTRUCTIONS:*

1. Properly wash the rice (5-8 times, till water doesn't blur anymore) and, subsequently, let them soak in water for at least 6 hours
2. Properly drain and steam the rice for 30 minutes (we steamed using a pot, metal sieve and cotton dishtowel, worked out quite alright)
3. In parallel, prepare a coconut syrup: warm up coconut milk \[1 cup / 250 ml\] over medium heat and mix in the sugar and a teaspoon of salt
4. Bring to a slight boil, but don't reduce it! Once sugar is dissolved, put the lid on and set aside
5. Once the rice is cooked, put it in a bowl and immediately combine with the coconut syrup (it must be still hot/warm).
6. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil and let rest for a total of 45 minutes. Give it a short fold 15 minutes in and cover again with the foil for the remaining 30 minutes.
7. Use this time to prepare the salty coconut sauce by bringing a bit less than half a cup (100 ml) of coconut milk to a slight boil in your sauce pan and adding 1/4 tsp of salt.
8. Also add rice or corn starch \[1 tsp\] in order to reach a more saucy consistency while boiling. Don't reduce too much and take off the stove once it thickens a bit
9. Serve sweet sticky rice with a few slices of mango and pour some of that salty sauce on top. Sprinkle with roasted yellow mung beans, or alternatively, sesame seeds

Prep Time: 20 minutes

Cook Time: 30 minutes

Total Time: 50 minutes 

Servings: 6 Calories: 417kcal

### Equipment

* Baking sheet
* Hand mixer
* Parchment paper

### Ingredients

* ¾ cup ricotta cheese
* 5.4 ounce can coconut cream
* 2 tablespoons maple syrup plus 2 teaspoons
* 1 sheet puff pastry thawed
* 1 egg
* 1 tablespoon water
* 12 figs halved
* ¾ pound red cherries pitted and halved

#### For serving:

* Flaky sea salt
* Thai basil leaves
* Mint leaves

### Instructions

* Preheat oven to 375ºF.

#### Prepare the ricotta and coconut:

* In a large bowl, combine the ricotta and coconut cream and mix for at least 5-7 minutes until the ricotta is light and fluffy. Add 2 tablespoons of maple syrup and mix 1-2 minutes more. Set aside.

#### Prepare the puff pastry:

* Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the thawed puff pastry sheet on top and lightly smooth it out, being careful not to overwork it.
* In a bowl, whisk together the egg and water. Using a brush, brush along a 1-inch perimeter of the puff pastry. If desired, use a fork or knife to lightly score alongside the edge of the egg wash. Use a fork to lightly all over the inside of the tart. *Do not prick the edge you brushed with the egg wash!*
* Spoon the whipped ricotta over the center of the puff pastry. Allow yourself about half an inch of space between the ricotta edge and the egg wash as the ricotta will spread while it cooks.
* Arrange the fruit on top of the ricotta. If desired, drizzle the remaining 2 teaspoons of maple syrup all over the fruit. Sprinkle lightly with flaky sea salt.
* Transfer to the oven for 30 minutes.

#### To serve:

2021-07-18,10,"Southern Chicken Stew","thecaglediaries","**Ingredients**  
1 (4lb) Whole Chicken, cut into pieces  
1 Tablespoon Creole Seasoning  
¾ Cup Canola Oil  
1 Cup All Purpose Flour  
1 Large Yellow Onion, diced  
1 Large Stalk Celery, diced  
1 Large Green Bell Pepper, diced  
3 Cloves Garlic, Minced  
6 Cups Chicken Bone Broth  
½lb Baby Carrots  
4 Large Red Potatoes, quartered  
**Instructions**  
Cut up and season the chicken with the Creole Seasoning  
In a large Cast Iron Pot (or Dutch Oven) heat ¼ Cup of canola oil. Add the seasoned chicken and sear on both sides. Remove and set to the side.  
Add remaining canola oil to the pot along with the flour. Stir well and cook until a dark chocolate color. Stir continuously so not to burn. Scrape the bottom of any chicken residues.  
Dice the onion, bell pepper and celery and once the roux (oil and flour) has reached the right color add to the pot.  
Cook until translucent. (about 4-5 minutes)  
Add the garlic and cook another 2 minutes.  
Add the chicken broth and stir well to combine.  
Bring the broth to a boil then turn down the heat to simmer, covered, for 1 hour.  
Add the chicken pieces back to the broth, along with the potatoes and carrots. Stir well and cover again. Simmer for another hour on low.  
Serve over a bed of rice, or mashed potatoes.  
Notes  
If the chicken stew has not thickened to your preference, the best way to thicken at the end is to add a little instant mashed potato. This works great, thickens well and adds to the flavor as there are already potatoes in the dish.  
  
If there is too much grease for you (from the chicken skin), allow the chicken stew to cool a few minutes then skim the top.

[Full recipe with step-by-step pictures HERE](https://tasteabroad.com/recipe/easy_seafood_paella/)

**INGREDIENTS**

1/2 lb Shrimp  
1/2 lb Clams   
10 oz Seafood Mix  
1 Red Bell Pepper  
1 medium Yellow Onion  
2 cups Arborio Rice  
1 packet Carmencita Paellero Seasoning   
2 cups Chicken Stock   
4 tablespoons Tomato Puree  
1 tablespoon Smoked Paprika  
1/2 cup Olive oil  
to taste Fresh Parsley  
to taste Salt

**DIRECTIONS**

I used a paella pan however any thin bottom metal pan would work. 

1. Preheat your pan and add 1/4 of olive oil. Let the oil get hot and season it with a pinch of sea salt. 
2. Make sure to thaw and drain excess liquid from your seafood mix before using.  

3. Add seafood mix to the pan and sear for 5 minutes while stirring it on medium heat.
4. Take the seared mix out of the pan and set it aside.
5. Add the rest of 1/4 olive oil to the pan. Wait for 10 seconds to make sure the oil heats up.
6. Add nicely chopped onion. Saute for 1 minute and add nicely diced red bell pepper. Cook on medium heat stirring for another 4 minutes or until onions become translucent.
7. Add tomato puree and smoked paprika, mix well.
8. Lower the heat to a minimum. Add 2 cups of chicken stock to the pan. Mix well and add 1 pack of Carmencita Paellero seasoning.
9. Return seared seafood mix to the stock and stir for 1 minute.
10. Increase heat back to medium. Add 2 cups of arborio rice to the stock. Try to spread it evenly however DO NOT stir! The secret to a real authentic paella is a crispy ""burnt"" bottom - socarrat, so no stirring is allowed at any time.
11. Instead to allow the stock to coat all of our rice, use a wooden spoon and dip it in several areas reaching the bottom of the pan.
12. Let it cook poking rice with the soon occasionally for 15 min. Add water if necessary if your stock evaporates too quickly or adjust the heat. Add water in smaller portions and pour only around the rim of the pan.
13. Lay your shrimp ( I peel and devein mine) and clams on top of rice and let it all cook for another 5 minutes or until clams shells will start opening. If all the liquid from the rice is gone by this step, add a little bit of water. We need that steam to cook our shrimp, Add water in smaller portions and pour only around the rim of the pan.
14. Now it's time to create that famous socarrat, the crispy rice bottom which defines the real-deal paella.
15. Crank up the heat to maximum and let paella crisp up on the bottom. Keep moving the pan so all the areas get even attention.
16. Now remove from heat and cover with some foil immediately. Let it rest for 10 minutes and dress up with some fresh parsley and lemon wedges. Serve right in the pan and enjoy!",2917
2021-07-14,35,"Fluffy and Creamy Custard Buns - A Dim Sum Classic","cookingwithRobin","Steamed custard buns are a dim sum classic. The buns are fluffy and the custard filling is very creamy! If you make them in bulk, feel free to seal the leftover buns in a zip-lock bag, you can refrigerate them for 2-3 days or freeze them for weeks. Just defrost overnight and warm them up when you want a creamy bun for breakfast/brunch or dessert!

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/0_0p2gU-PFM)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients (10 buns):**

**Custard filling:**

\- 2 eggs

\- 20g cake flour

\- 10g cornstarch

\- 15g milk powder

\- 40g sugar

\- 15g condensed milk

\- 120g milk

\- 1g salt

\- 20g melted butter

**Dough:**

\- 250g all purpose flour

\- 130g warm water

\- 1 tsp (5ml) oil

\- 1/2 tsp (2g) yeast

\- 1 tsp (4g) sugar

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

**Custard filling:**

1. Mix the ingredients of the custard filling in a big bowl.
2. Cook the mixture using low to medium heat. Keep stirring until it forms a creamy texture. Put it aside for about 5 minutes to cool it off. The ingredients I used here can make 10 custard buns and the filling for one bun weighs about 28 grams.
3. Shape the filling into a ball shape using your palms. Cover them with a plastic wrapper and refrigerate them for later use.

**Dough:**

1. Dissolve the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Mix the flour, oil, and water together to form a dough. Knead the dough until its smooth.
2. Divide the dough into ten pieces evenly. Cover them with a plastic wrapper to prevent them from drying out.
3. Take out one piece and knead the dough for about 30 seconds to remove the air bubbles. Fold the edge of the dough into the center. Keep repeating this and youll get a smooth side. Flatten the dough using a rolling pin, push down and roll forward to the edge in a single motion, repeat this until you get a round shape, then thin the edge out.
4. Keep the smooth side down. Place the filling in the center of the dough, pinch the edge together and make sure to seal it completely.

**Steaming:**

1. Place all the buns in a steamer and let them proof for about 20 minutes in a warm environment ideally around 90^(o)F.
2. Place the steamer on top of the cold water, turn on the stove and use high heat to boil the water. Once the water starts boiling, you can hear the rolling boil sound and see the steam coming out. Set your timer for 12 minutes.
3. When the time is up, turn off the stove, but remember to leave the steamer closed for another 5 minutes. Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. Because this recipe only requires the dough to rise once, there is no need to start the dough early.
2. The key to making the filling very creamy is to use a sifter twice. The first time is to sift through all the flours such as cake flour, cornstarch, and milk powder. The second time is to sift the mixture before heating it up.
3. The warm water and sugar will help to activate the yeast.
4. If you want to make this in bulk, a little bit of oil can help to maintain the softness of the dough for a few days.
5. Do not open the steamer immediately after the heat off, otherwise the buns will shrink due to the sudden change of the temperature.",3192

Toss red peppers, zucchini, chickpeas, and herbs through couscous. Top with sliced lamb and Sprinkle with almonds. 

A nice mix of spices and herbs. The couscous is a really filling base as well - 3.5/5

Ras el hanout is a Moroccan spice mixture used for the lamb seasoning. I could not find this in the store,so I mixed my own. The recipe I used had 15 spices, but some blends had as many as 30! Cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove are present and reminded my American palate of pie lol it was definitely interesting to pair with a savory dish. 

It can be difficult to find a variety of lamb cuts in us grocery stores, so I used a chuck chop for this recipe, and roasted it instead of grilling. The chops, red peppers, and zucchini were roasted at 425°f, so I was able to do them at the same time, but with each having their own pan. The peppers need 20 min, while the zucchini and lamb both need 15. The lamb should rest covered with a foil top for 5 more minutes.

1 cup heavy cream 35%MF at least  
  
1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk  
  
2 cups mango ripe, cubed  
  
1 envelope powdered gelatin 1/4 oz, or 2 1/2 tsp  
  
1/4 cup mango juice or water\*  
  
**Instructions**  
  
Beat the heavy cream in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Use a rubber spatula to fold the condensed milk into the cream until well combined.  
  
Pour the mango juice (or water) into a small microwave-safe bowl. Sprinkle the gelatin powder evenly over the surface of the water. Allow it to sit for 3-5 minutes, until spongy. Microwave at 10-second intervals, until liquid. Mix with a fork to ensure the gelatin has dissolved completely.  
  
Add the mango cubes to a blender and blend until smooth with no lumps, about 1 minute. Add the dissolved gelatin to the pureed mango and blend for another 30 seconds to 1 minute, until very well combined.  
  
Pour the mango puree into the mixing bowl of cream. Gently fold the mixture together with the rubber spatula until uniform in color. Pour the mixture into 4 rocks glasses or glass dessert cups. Cover each glass with plastic and allow the mousse to set in the fridge for at least 4 hours, or overnight.  
  
**Notes**  
  
\*If you use juice, make sure it isnt acidic like orange, pineapple, or grapefruit. This will impact how the gelatin sets.

Perhaps you are right, about it not being the right beer. I shall pour it out, and recycle the bottles. Im sure it is fine stuff, just not to my liking.

The recipe I am going to use calls for sautéing two sliced large onions in a pot, more if you are making two tenderloins&I dont caramelize them. I pierce the tenderloins in several spots and insert fresh, washed parsley, and fresh slice garlic, brown them a bit in a separate pan, place them on the onions, add some dry white wine, salt, pepper, granulated garlic powder, turn them with some long tongs, so I dont squeeze the tenderloins. Then I add beef broth, or you can use bouillon cubes in warm water, or even vegetable broth&if thats what you have in the house, add two or three fresh bay leaves, some dry oregano which you rub between thumb and forefinger, turn the meat at intervals, keep the cover on or half on. It doesnt take long to cook. Remove the tenderloin, let it rest, slice thinly, or however you like it. serve it alongside mashed potatoes made from Yukon or&Im blanking on the other potatoes one uses for good mashed potatoes. I also serve with greens ie rappini cooked with fresh garlic etc. It reheats up well. I think thats what Ill make. You ladle the au jus on the tendons etc.

I shall try your chicken recipe with a different beer. I forget if you mentioned which beer you used. But it shall have to be in a week or two&too busy to try anything new in next few days.

Addendum: best potatoes for mashed Russet or Yukon. I read that, and tried it, and I daresay its true&imho.",1646

* 1 pound tomatillos husked and rinsed
* 1 jalapeño trimmed
* 1 shallot trimmed and sliced into wedges
* 6 cloves garlic peeled
* 1 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves and tender stems

## Instructions

**Roast the tomatillos:**

* Preheat oven to 450ºF. Arrange tomatillos, jalapeño, and shallot wedges on a foil-lined baking sheet. Drizzle with avocado oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven for 10-15 minutes until the skins are blistered and beginning to char. Remove and set aside.

**Prepare the cilantro oil:**

* Meanwhile, combine the cilantro, extra virgin olive oil, and salt in a food processor and pulse until completely blended. If needed, add more extra virgin olive oil to thin out the oil. It should be a drizzling consistency. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. No need to clean out the food processor!

**Prepare the risotto:**

* Heat the avocado oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook, stirring often, for 5-6 minutes until it softens. Melt 2 tablespoons butter into the shallot and add the rice. Cook for 3 minutes.
* Add 1 ladle of the stock and stir constantly until it is mostly absorbed. Continue on for 20 minutes, alternating adding 1 ladle of stock and stirring regularly until all the stock has been added and the rice is close to almost tender.

**Finish the risotto:**

* Add the salsa verde and continue stirring for an additional 15 minutes until the rice is tender and thick. Turn off the heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, if desired. Taste and season to your preferences.
* To serve:Spoon the warm risotto into bowls and drizzle the cilantro oil on top. Serve with sliced radishes and cotija cheese.

2021-07-09,22,"Shortcut Pumpkin Ravioli (Freezer Friendly)","yellowjacquet","Shortcut pumpkin ravioli!! Get the delicious homemade filling without the hassle of making fresh pasta!

This is one of my favorite freezer meals to make, its so easy to pull these out for a quick lunch or dinner. They use premade dumpling wrappers to skip the process of forming the ravioli from scratch (which has its place, but for me thats much less often)! For a quick lunch I will just serve them tossed in olive oil, but if Im pulling them out for dinner I like to dress them up with browned butter and fresh thyme as pictured.

You can also use this as a filling in standard ravioli with the dough made from scratch and its delicious, or apply this trick with your favorite ravioli filling. The result is a thinner pasta than a traditional ravioli but still a delicious meal.

# Shortcut Pumpkin Ravioli

**Makes:  50 rav, 6 servings  (\~8 rav per serving)**

# Ingredients

**For batch prep:**

* 2  15 oz cans of unflavored pumpkin puree
* 1 pack of 50 dumpling/potsticker wrappers
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 1 cup freshly grated parmesan (see note)
* 4 tbsp butter
* 3 tbsp light brown sugar
* ¼ tsp ground nutmeg
* Salt

**To prepare each serving (see instructions):**

* 1 tbsp salted butter or olive oil
* 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves (optional)

**Notes**

I do not recommend using canned parmesan in this recipe, it does not melt down as nicely.

# Instructions

1. Make sure your garlic is minced and parmesan is grated before beginning. Open your cans of pumpkin so they can be quickly added in a later step. In a small bowl combine the nutmeg, brown sugar, and 1 tsp of salt.
2. Melt the butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Once melted, stir frequently until the butter browns and gives off a nutty smell, about 1 to 3 minutes depending on the temp of your stove. Once the butter is lightly browned add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 more minute.
3. Quickly add the pumpkin to the skillet and mix to incorporate it into the butter and garlic mixture. Cook the pumpkin over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes.
4. Sprinkle the sugar/salt/nutmeg mixture over the pumpkin in the skillet and mix to incorporate. Continue cooking for another 2 minutes.
5. Remove from heat and mix in the grated parm, stir until its fully incorporated. Allow the mixture to cool to room temp before filling the ravioli.
6. To fill, place a leveled tablespoon of filling on the dumpling wrapper, slightly off-center (I use a cookie scoop for this step). Dip your finger into a small bowl of water and wet along the edge of the wrapper to seal, then fold the wrapper in half to create a semicircle. Pinch the wrapper closed, pressing from the edges in towards the center to avoid squeezing out any filling. (Optionally, press the tines of a fork around the edge to create the ridged ravioli look, this is just for looks and is not needed to seal the ravioli, typically I skip this step to save time.) \[Note -- I have a picture that explains this better on my post to another sub, this sub doesnt allow multiple images\]

**To Freeze:**

* Arrange the rav on a cookie sheet so they do not tough, freeze for 15+ mins then transfer to a zip bag to freeze long term. (If freezing, do not skip the cookie sheet step, otherwise they will all stick together in the bag and be ruined).

**To Prepare:**

* Boil the rav for 2 minutes (from frozen), or \~90 seconds (fresh). I recommend freezing them first to help them hold their shape a bit better even if youre preparing them right away.
* Toss each serving (\~8 rav) in 1 tbsp of browned butter or 1 tbsp of olive oil, then optionally top with 1 tsp of fresh thyme leaves. (For a quick lunch I just do the olive oil, for a nicer meal I do the brown butter + thyme). To prepare the browned butter melt butter over medium heat, mix constantly until the butter begins to brown, then remove from heat and let cool for \~3 mins before using.

2021-07-08,4,"Steamed Fish with Hot Scallion Oil Recipe","cookingwithRobin","Steamed fish with hot scallion oil is quick and easy while being super fragrant and delicious! The fish is both juicy and tender, and is infused with the aromatic flavor of the hot scallion oil. Additionally the sweetness of the seafood sauce is well balanced with the soy sauce.Any whitefish is a good choice for steaming such as tilapia, sea bass, red snapper, etc. Make sure the fish is as fresh as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/FuPk7r5-5s4)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

\- 1lb sea bass

\- 4 scallions

\- 15g ginger

\- 1g Sichuan peppercorns (optional)

\- 3-4 dried chilies (optional)

\- 3 tbsps oil

&amp;#x200B;

Seafood sauce:

\- 3 tbsps soy sauce

\- 1 tbsp sesame oil

\- 1 tbsp black vinegar

\- 4 tbsps water

\- 1g salt

\- 4g sugar

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Have the fish gutted and descaled (most fishmongers do that for free).
2. Score the fish at a 45-degree angle for about three to four times on both sides. This will help the fish to cook through quickly and absorb more flavors.
3. Place 10 ginger slices inside the cut and the fish belly. Ginger is not only aromatic, it can also get rid of fishy smell. Place the fish on top of several scallion pieces on the plate so the fish will not touch the plate directly.
4. Bring the water to a rolling boil, then steam the fish over high heat for about 8 to 12 minutes (1-1.5lbs) depending on the size of your fish.
5. Make the seafood sauce using soy sauce, sesame oil, black vinegar, water, salt, and sugar.
6. When the time is up, discard all the liquid in the plate because that is the source of the bad fishy taste. Add the seafood sauce around the fish following the edge of the plate and spread the scallion strips on top of the fish.
7. Fry the scallions in 3 tbsps of oil over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Pour the hot oil over the fish. Enjoy! (I also used dried chilies and sichuan peppercorns in the oil to add a hint of spiciness and numbing sensation, but these two ingredients are optional.)",2065

**Enjoy the recipe and** [**our United Cuisines show on YouTube!**](https://youtu.be/L3TqgSEt9gI)

*INGREDIENTS:*

\- fresh strawberries \[0.9 lbs / 400 g\]

\- whipping cream \[1.25 cups / 300 ml\]

\- meringue \[1.1 oz / 32 g\]

\- vanilla extract \[0.5 tsp / 2 ml\]

Servings: 3

*INSTRUCTIONS:*

1. Wash the strawberries and cut into quarters. Remove pedicel and leaf cap except on three strawberries, which you can use for decorative purposes
2. Whip the cream, which probably is the one and only challenge in this recipe! Cool down your whisk and bowl in the fridge, which can make difference, esp. on hot summer days. The cream must be cold, too. We not only stored it in the fridge, but put in into the freezer for 30 minutes before whipping it
3. Perform stiffness test on your whipped cream: it should double in volume and remain in the bowl, when turned upside down shortly
4. Mix in vanilla extract into the cream
5. Assemble the Eton Mess by adding half of the whipped cream to the strawberries and break up the meringue into bite-size pieces and spread on top. Gently mix/fold everything and repeat the step with remaining cream and meringue
6. Transfer into your favorite serving vehicle and enjoy ASAP, otherwise the crunchy meringue will turn soft

**Note:** We did not add any sugar, for the meringue is extremely sweet already, and our ripe strawberries were great without any additional sugar.

* Salt and pepper to taste

**Squash Blossom Tacos:**

* Vegetable oil for frying

* 1 teaspoon salt
* 8 small corn tortillas
* Vegan or traditional cotija cheese

# Instructions

1. **Start the cherry salsa:** Preheat oven to 450ºF. Arrange the tomatoes, onion, and jalapeño on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the oven for 15 minutes until charred.
2. **Char the cherries:** Add the cherries to the baking sheet and drizzle with the remaining oil. Turn the broiler on and broil the cherries for 2-3 minutes until they begin to char. Turn off the heat.
3. **Finish the salsa:** Place the garlic and lime juice in a food processor and pulse until completely minced. Add the warm roasted vegetables and continue pulsing until smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and set aside until serving.
4. **Prepare the zucchini garnish:** Combine the small-diced zucchini in a bowl with the minced scallion. Add the lime juice and extra virgin olive oil. Season with a sprinkle of salt (around 1/4 teaspon) and toss to combine. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.

7. One by one, dip the squash blossoms in the batter until coated. Shake off the excess and drop into the oil. Fry the blossoms in batches and be careful not to over-crowd the pot. Fry for 2 minutes per side until golden brown all over. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt immediately after they come out of the hot oil.
8. **Prepare the corn tortillas:** Right before serving, char the tortillas over an open flame or steam them in the microwave or oven depending on preference.
9. **To serve:** Place two tortillas on each plate and spoon the cherry salsa on top and use the back of your spoon to smooth it into a circle. Place two fried squash blossoms on each taco and spoon the zucchini garnish on top. Sprinkle with vegan or traditional cotija cheese. Enjoy!

* 1 large onion white or yellow
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 8 cloves garlic
* 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves packed
* 2-4 cups vegetable broth
* 2 sprigs thyme
* 1/2 cup coconut milk aka coconut cream  


**Instructions**

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Slice the Roma tomatoes in half and quarter the onion. Arrange the tomatoes, as well as the cherry tomatoes, on a large baking sheet with the onion. Drizzle everything with 3 tbsp olive oil and generously season with salt and pepper.
2. Place the garlic on a sheet of foil and drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Wrap tightly and place in the middle of the baking sheet. Roast the veggies for 40-45 minutes until blistered and browned, tossing every 15-20 minutes to ensure even cooking.  
Add the roasted veggies and garlic to a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the basil and 2 cups of vegetable broth to the pot. Use an immersion blender\* to blend the soup until it's completely smooth. If needed, add more broth until the soup has reached your desired consistency.
3. Add the thyme and turn the heat onto medium. Simmer for 10 minutes, then remove the thyme. Stir in the coconut milk, taste for salt and pepper, and add more if needed. Garnish with basil and serve.

**Notes**

\*No immersion blender? No problem! You can blend this soup up in a regular blender or even a food processor. Blend in batches if needed.

Use any one or more varieties of tomatoes that you prefer. I love the deep flavor from Roma tomatoes mixed with sweetness from grape/cherry tomatoes. You can use heirloom tomatoes as well. The color may end up different, but the soup will be delicious.",1852

2021-07-03,106,"Yogurt cake with only 3 ingredients","Japslap","You good. Shouldn't hurt anything. Direct contact between parchment and metal is fine. Really no need to grease in between the metal and parchment.

You *can* grease the top side, ie the side contacting the food, but sometimes it's not neccesary. Generally, you put down parchment because it provides a better non stick surface than your metal pans. Thus, food easier to lift off better.

For example, if you were baking cookies-- you would grease the pan, if no parchment, to prevent caramelizing and sticking. If you use parchment, there is no need to grease the top of the parchment.. cookies will not stick to it.

Sometimes when I roast veggies in the oven, I do it on parchment. I don't per say ""grease the parchment"", but I generally use oil on my veggies that eventually gets all over the top of the parchment. I really just use parchment in this case to expedite cleanup. I use a peice larger than my pan, then the pan never gets dirty, and I just throw away the parchment.

I think this cake would be a nightmare to remove from a pan without parchment. Not impossible, but certainly more difficult.",1108

2021-07-03,4,"Taro Macarons with Taro Swiss Meringue Buttercream Filling","reddituser246","Macaron Shells

Ingredients

- 140 g almond flour
- 130 g powdered sugar
- 15 g taro powder
- 100 g room temperature egg whites (about 3 large eggs)
- Pinch of salt
- 1/4 tsp lemon juice (or white vinegar or cream of tartar)
- 90 g granulated sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla
- Few drops of purple food coloring (or a combination of blue and red)

Directions

1. In a food processor, add in your almond flour, powdered sugar, and taro powder. Process until very fine, about 30 seconds. Then sift into a large bowl.

2. Add your room temperature egg whites with a pinch of salt in a separate bowl and start beating on low speed. Once foamy, you can add in your lemon juice and gradually start adding in your sugar, about a few teaspoons at a time. As you add in more and more sugar, you can gradually increases the speed of the mixer and continue to beat the egg whites until you get stiff peaks. Your peaks are stiff enough when you can overturn the bowl and nothing falls out.

3. Add in your vanilla and food coloring and mix in on low speed.

4. Fold a 1/3 of your dry ingredients into the meringue.

5. Gently fold in the rest of the dry ingredients and continue mixing. If you can scoop up some of the batter with a rubber spatula and draw a complete figure 8 as the batter flows off of it, you are done mixing.

6. Place your batter in a piping bag with a standard round piping tip and begin piping one inch dollops onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat. If using parchment, pipe a little bit of batter in the corners of the paper to keep it flat.

7. Tap your trays of piped macaron batter a few times on the counter to release air bubbles and let them rest for about 40 minutes to an hour. After resting, a skin should have formed on your dollops of macarons, enough that you can gently touch the macaron dollops without leaving an indent. Meanwhile, pre-heat your oven to 300F.

8. Bake for 12-15 minutes. Then allow to completely cool before removing from the tray. Your macarons are perfectly baked if they peel cleanly off the parchment or mat. You are now ready to make the buttercream and start filling.

Taro Swiss Meringue Buttercream

Ingredients

- 2 egg whites
- 1/2 cup of sugar
- pinch of salt
- 1/4 tsp lemon juice (or white vinegar)
- 10 tbsp butter
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup taro powder

Directions

1. Separate your egg whites from the yolks, making sure not a single drop of yolk ends up in the whites. Place your egg whites in a heatproof bowl such as metal. Reserve yolks for another purpose.

2. Add in the sugar and set the bowl over a pot that is simmering with a couple inches of water.

3. Whisk the egg whites and sugar constantly until all the sugar is dissolved. You can use your fingers to feel if there are still granules of sugar in the egg mixture. Then take it off the pot.

4. Add in your salt and lemon juice. Then on medium-high speed, beat the mixture until it reaches stiff peaks. You know you have reached this stage when you can overturn the bowl and none of the meringue falls out. Avoid over-beating.

5. Add in your softened butter about a tablespoon at a time, making sure you mix in between each tablespoon.

6. Mix in your vanilla and taro powder.

Assembly

1. Pair up macaron shells of similar size.

2. Pipe a dollop of the buttercream onto the flat side of one the macaron shells and then top with the other, forming a sandwich.

* 2 zucchini 
* 4 roma tomatoes 
* 3 bell peppers 
* olive oil 
* salt 
* pepper

**Directions** 

1. The night before, combine 1 pound cubed beef sirloin, 2 tablespoons coconut aminos, ½ tbsp dried basil, ½ tbsp maras chili, salt, and pepper. Marinade overnight for best results, but at least for one hour. 
2. That same night before, combine 1 pound cubed pork tenderloin, 2 tablespoons coconut aminos, ½ tbsp dried oregano, ½ tbsp aleppo chili, ½ tsp brown sugar, salt, and pepper. Marinade overnight for best results, but at least for one hour. 
3. Day of, rough cube 2 zucchini, 4 roma tomatoes, and 3 bell peppers so that they fit on your skewers. Season with salt, pepper, and olive oil. 
4. Put beef and vegetables on skewers, alternating. Put pork and vegetables on other skewers. I recommend separating beef and pork skewers because they will cook to different temperatures. 
5. Grill kabobs until done; time will vary depending on your grill heat. You want to aim for the grill to be about 400°F. Cook until beef registers 140°F for medium, and pork registers 160°F.

I have been obsessed with the earthy tones and subtle spice of aleppo and maras chili pepper. Somehow I thought the aleppo was more suited for pork, and maras for beef, and went for a slightly different but subtly similar flavor profile in the two meats. Of course you can use aleppo for both, maras for both, or substitute cayenne and paprika if you don't have either of those unique spices.

Unless those are truly massive blueberries, that cake is at most 3/4 of an inch thick and baked in a 6in tin or smaller.

I just baked this recipe doubled and in a 9 in pan for 45 minutes at 355 and it's only 3/4 of an inch thick after the bake. It has a massive crack that went all the way down and most of the diameter of the cake. I did not use a bain marie and probably should have here. This might be overbaked yet has no color on top or edges like the photo.

It's currently chilling in the fridge so I cannot speak to its taste or texture but will update later.

I used twice the sweetener (as I cannot use non-calorie sweeteners and they tend to be far more sweet than glucose/sucrose sweeteners) at 30g per batch and used brown sugar for additional flavor. \~1/2 tsp of vanilla extract was also added per batch. I used full fat greek yogurt so that may change the texture.

Depending on how tonight's taste test turns out, I may buy regular whole milk yogurt and try it again for comparison if needed.

Edit- The texture is far better than I expected and the flavor is lovely. Don't bother making this as is, double the recipe unless you happen to have a very small 6in dia or less springform pan.

The whole milk can be substituted for coconut, but this will considerably change the flavor of the final soup. If desired, you can add leeks, chicken or cabbage during the cooking process, but fundamentally, this soup is just a shamelessly heavy carb-fest. Serves 2.  
   
For the soup:  
1 cup whole milk  
½ cup dry Israeli couscous or preferred whole grain (ex. Farro or barley)   
2 scallion greens, thinly sliced  
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced  
1 tsp butter  
1 dried shiitake mushroom, or 1 tsp mushroom stock concentrate  
1 tbsp dried Herbs de Provence, or 1 sprig each of marjoram, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and sage  
1 tsp fennel seed  
1 whole bay leaf  
Salt, MSG &amp; black pepper to taste  
Freshly grated nutmeg to taste  
   
For the oil:   
2 scallion whites, thinly sliced  
1 clove garlic, smashed   
2 inches fresh lemon peel (Zest will burn)   
¼ tsp ground turmeric  
4 tbsp neutral or olive oil (I use rice bran)  
   
INSTRUCTIONS  
In a small bowl, heat 1 cup whole milk until hot to the touch but not boiling. Add Herbs de Provence, fennel seed, and bay leaf and allow to steep until cooled to room temperature. Strain to remove herbs and set aside. For a low-effort version, steep finely minced or dried herbs and dont strain them out. Meanwhile, reconstitute dried shiitake in ¼ cup of boiling water.  
Add butter to a large saucepan over medium-low heat and allow to foam. Add couscous or grain and toast, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden and nutty-smelling. Add sliced garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and golden around the edges, before pouring in the soaking liquid used to reconstitute the mushroom. This is basically liquid umami. You can slice the mushroom and add it to your soup, or simply toss it out. Once the liquid has begun to cook off, add the herb-steeped milk you set aside earlier. Allow the soup to reduce over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the grain or couscous is cooked through and milk has thickened. DO NOT allow the milk to boil. Season with salt, MSG and black pepper to taste.   
	While the soup is cooking, in a cold pan, combine neutral oil, lemon peel, smashed garlic, and scallion whites. Heat up over a low flame and allow to slowly fry, removing each ingredient if it begins to char, until all ingredients are thoroughly browned and oil is fragrant. You can dispose of most of the ingredients, but, if desired, add the crispy scallion whites to your soup as a garnish. Shut off the heat and add turmeric, stirring to avoid burning, until oil is stained a vivid yellow-gold color.   
	Separate soup into bowls and add a few gratings of fresh nutmeg. Top with scallion greens, then spoon oil around the bowl.

Turned out great!  I hope you enjoy.

4 Chicken thighs - skinless and boneless

&amp;#x200B;

3 celery stalks - cut into ½ in pieces

2 shallots - cut into very thin circles

4 cloves of garlic - rough dice

2 cans of water chestnuts

&amp;#x200B;

2 tbsp avocado oil (Grapeseed, canola, or another high smoke point oil is also fine)

2 tbsp EVOO

1 cup of white wine

1 cup of chicken stock

1 lemon (Juice)

2 tbsp butter

&amp;#x200B;

S/P

1 tbsp soy sauce (Tamari)

1 tbsp dried dill (2-3x if fresh dill available)

1 tbsp dried basil (4-5 leaves if fresh is available)

1 tbsp crushed red pepper

Celery leaves (Optional) if available from the celery bunch - finely diced

&amp;#x200B;

**Methodology:**

I used a cast iron pan for this recipe and would highly recommend it because of the high and consistent heat that allows you to sear the chicken well and still maintain the moisture.  I am sure you could achieve similar results with a wok.

Drain **water chestnuts** and place in a bowl.  Toss with **soy sauce** (I use tamari) and let it rest for later.

Season the **chicken thighs** w/**salt and pepper**.  Do not be afraid to season well, as this makes all the difference in delicious chicken.  A good portion is lost to the pan as you saute the chicken.

Heat the cast iron until it smokes slightly.  This is incredibly important to properly cook both the chicken and to saute the veggies.

Add **avocado oil** and let it heat up for an additional minute.  It will run quickly in the pan, and again the pan will smoke slightly.

Place the **chicken** in the pan, laying them away from you.  Do not move them in the pan.  They will release as they sear.  Cook for 3-4 minutes per side.  I like to cook to a slight pink and then finish it off for the last minute once the sauce is complete in the pan.  Remove and let cool for 5 minutes while you make your veggies and sauce.  Once cool, slice the chicken into bite sized pieces and set aside.

With the heat still cranking, add **EVOO** and immediately add **celery**.  EVOO has a much lower smoking point, so you dont want to heat it in a searing cast iron pan.  On the other hand it does add to the flavor of the vegetable which is why I use it.

Add the **celery** immediately and saute.  After a couple of minutes add the **shallots**.  Then after another couple of minutes add the **garlic**.  Saute for a couple of minutes until the garlic just gets the slightest touch of brown.

At this point, you want to arrest the browning of the garlic by adding liquid.  Deglaze with **white wine** and scrape your pan of the fond.  After a minute to allow much of the alcohol to cook off, add the **chicken stock** and, keeping the heat high, allow this to reduce for a few minutes.  Depending on how quickly it reduces you may want to lower the heat to medium.

While reducing, use a mortar and pestle to ground the **dill**, **basil** and **crushed red pepper**.  This isnt absolutely necessary, but I like to do this to release more flavor from dried herbs and to more evenly spread the heat through your dish.  Add to the sauce.  Also add the finely diced **celery leaves**.

At this point you can add the **water chestnuts**.  These dont need to be cooked for too long, which is why I wait to add them toward the end.

When the sauce thickens enough that a spatula begins to leave a trail, squeeze your **lemon**.  After another minute, add the **butter** in slices to finish the sauce.  As it melts, add the **chicken** pieces to finish off.

Cook for another minute or two until the chicken is finished, the sauce has reached a luscious consistency, and everything is coated beautifully.  A little Italian, a little Asian, and a ton of fun to make...  Enjoy!",3980

This is one of few recipes from this book that I was able to obtain all if the listed ingredients for. 3/5 I have learned that I'm not really fond of Tarragon, but this sauce was pretty well balanced.

2021-06-29,1,"Cotoletta alla Milanese, summer edition: arugula and cherry tomatoes on top!","eatalianwithroberto","Here a great classic of North Italy food tradition: veal Milanese, the summer way. It happens to be my favorite also during winter. Enjoy!

**INGREDIENTS:**  
""            3 veal chops with bones in Italian: ""nodini di vitello""  
""            q.s. water  
""            50 gr all purpose flour  
""            30 gr bread crumbs  
""            30 gr grated Parmigiano Reggiano you can use Grana Padano  
""            2 organic eggs  
""            q.s. clarified butter or vegetable oil to fry (original recipe requires clarified  
butter)  
""            q.s. cherry tomatoes optional, to garnish  
""            q.s. arugula optional, to garnish  


**INSTRUCTIONS:**  
Prepare the ingredients at ambient temperature. One of the  
secrets of a real milanese veal is to dip the meat into two different  
""powders"": first flour, second a mix 50-50 of bread crumbs and grated  
Parmigiano Reggiano.  
For each veal chop, you need to:  
1. (optional) remove the fat in excess (on the border),  
2. make two small cuts on the side with no bone, so that the  
meat will not curl during the cooking and will create the ""elephant  
ear""  
3. pound the meat to make it thinner and larger. This will  
be easier if you make it wet with some water (see video)  
If you want to garnish your cotoletta with arugula and  
cherry tomatoes, prepare a salad in advance. So it will have time to create a  
delicious juice, that you will pour on the cotoletta right after frying it.  
Pour a generous amount of vegetable oil (or clarified  
butter) into a pan, and turn the heat on. Now dip the meat into the flour. Do  
it carefully, every part needs to be covered with flour, thus the egg will  
better stick to it.  
Whisk the eggs, then carefully dip the meat into them. After  
the dip, drain it, or it will get messy once into the bread crumbs.  
Now dip it into a 50-50 mix of Parmigiano Reggiano and bread  
crumbs. Your veal chop is ready to be fried, so check for oil temperature (I  
use a drop of water, it the oil makes noise it's ready)...  
and drop the chop into the oil. Since you pounded the meat,  
it will take 2-2.5 minutes, each side.  
After the 4-5 minutes frying, remove the oil excess with  
some paper. Your authentic cotoletta alla milanese is ready! You can garnish it  
with some arugula and cherry tomatoes salas, or enjoy it with some french  
fries. Buon appetito :)",2377

**Ingredients**  
  
Cherry filling\*  
  
4 tbsp cornstarch  
  
1/2 cup water  
  
5 1/2 cups cherries whole, pitted  
  
2 tbsp lemon juice  
  
3/4 cup granulated sugar  
  
2 tsp vanilla extract

1 cup butter unsalted, softened  
  
2 cups granulated sugar  
  
3/4 tsp salt  
  
4 large eggs  
  
1 tsp vanilla extract  
  
1/4 tsp almond extract  
  
3 cups all-purpose flour  
  
1 tsp baking powder  
  
**Instructions**  
  
Cherry filling  
  
Whisk the cornstarch and water together to create a slurry. Add the cherries, lemon juice, sugar, vanilla, and prepared slurry to a large pot over medium heat.  
  
Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often, then turn the heat down to low. Cook, continuing to stir often, for about 10-15 minutes until the cherries release their moisture and the mixture thickens slightly. Let the cherries cool to room temperature.  
  
Bars  
  
Preheat the oven to 350F. Beat the butter, sugar, and salt together in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Add the eggs, beating them into the mixture one at a time, until combined. Add the vanilla and almond extract and give the mixture a quick stir.  
  
Whisk the flour and baking powder together, then add to the bowl of wet ingredients. Beat until you see no more flour, then scrape down the sides of the bowl and fold in any residual dry ingredients.  
  
Spray a 9×13 inch baking pan with cooking spray. Spread 3 cups of the batter evenly into the pan. Top with the prepared cherry filling, then dot the top of the filling with the remaining batter.  
  
Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the dotted batter begins to brown around the edges. Let the bars cool completely before slicing and serving. Optional: Drizzle with glaze\*\* before serving.  
  
**Notes**  
  
\*The homemade cherry filling in this recipe can be replaced with 2 21 oz cans of premade filling.  
  
\*\*To make a basic glaze:1. Whisk 1 cup of icing sugar (also known as powdered sugar or confectioners sugar) with 3-5 tbsp milk. Start with 3 tbsp, and add more as needed to reach your desired consistency.  
  
2. If you want to add flavor, you can add a splash of vanilla and/ or almond extract. Drizzle over the top of your completely cooled bars.",2431

3.Whisk Zabaione over the Bain-marie for around 2 minutes, you can control the temperature by lifting the bowl (Be careful not to burn yourself, if the water is boiling to rapidly lower the stove temperature)

4.Once Zabaione turns pale yellow and consistency seems thick but still runny remove from the heat.

6.Gently fold in the whipped cream into the Zabaione (Do not mix or whisk)

7.Transfer to the champagne glass, add summer fruits and enjoy this beautiful dessert!

&amp;#x200B;

**Insight:**

\- Egg yolk thickens at the temperature of 65C (149F) and sets at 70C (158F) while egg whites need 80C (176F) to coagulate.

\- By gently folding cream you preserve the air bubbles that were created during the whipping. Mixing, whisking and overfolding destroy this fragile structure.

\- Double and whipping cream foams thanks to the high amount of fat (30%-48%)

2021-06-25,52,"Easy Reese Cake","ancaom","Cauliflower with mayonnaise is quite popular in the Transylvania region, where I'm located :)

Here's how I prepare it (note though that there are several variations of the recipe):

1. Unwrap a medium cauliflower in bunches (500-600 g), wash it and boil it for 8-10 mins in boiling water with 2 tablespoons of milk (the milk is for keeping it white).
2. Separately, from a boiled egg yolk and a raw one, a little salt and pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of mustard, make a mayonnaise by gradually adding oil (150-200 ml) and stirring constantly. At the end, sour it with a little lemon juice or vinegar. Optionally, you can also add 1 tablespoon of sour cream to make it more creamy.
3. Drain the boiled cauliflower well, season it with salt and pepper by taste, then add it over the mayonnaise and mix them together.
4. I also add either a little finely chopped dill or 1-2 crushed garlic gloves.",891

Wok  
Small pot with lid

# Ingredients

* 1 cup uncooked white rice
* 2 cups water
* 1 tablespoon avocado oil plus more as needed
* 2 shallots peeled and sliced into wedges
* 4 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2-3 Thai chili peppers minced

* Salt and pepper to taste  


# Instructions

1. Prepare all of the vegetables and set them aside before beginning.  

2. Cook the white rice:  
In a small pot, combine the white rice and water and turn the heat to medium-high. Add salt. Once the water boils, reduce heat, cover, and cook for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest as you finish the pad krapow.  

3. Cook the aromatics:  
Heat avocado oil over medium heat in a large wok. Once hot, add the shallots and cook for 3-5 minutes until they soften.  
Add the garlic and Thai chili peppers and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Remove the aromatics from the wok and transfer to a bowl.

Add a touch more oil, if needed. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook, stirring often, for 8-9 minutes until they begin to soften and brown.  
Add the red bell peppers and cook 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer the vegetables to a bowl.  
Add the green beans to the wok and cook for 5 minutes. Season with salt.  

5. Prepare the sauce:  
Combine the soy sauce, vegetarian fish sauce, brown sugar, and sesame oil in a bowl. Add the sauce to the wok and allow it to bubble for 1-2 minutes to dissolve the sugar. Toss to coat.  

6. Finish the pad krapow:  
Return all the vegetablesbell peppers, mushrooms, and aromaticsto the wok along with the Thai basil leaves. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes. Taste and season to your preferences.

\- mozzarella \[4.4 oz / 125 g\]

\- young gouda cheese \[4.4 oz / 125 g\]

Servings: 6

*INSTRUCTIONS*:

1. Over medium-low heat, sauté one crushed garlic in 1 tablespoon olive oil for a minute and add the spinach (all of the spinach might not fit at once, but it will wilt a lot, so add one batch after another into the pan)
2. With a kitchen tong, mix and turn spinach upside down until fully cooked (wilted and takes on a dark green color). Put in a bowl and set aside to cool down
3. Finely chop the onion and sauté in the empty pan with a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-low heat for a few minutes till translucent
4. Crush in a garlic clove and sauté together for another minutes
5. Add the canned plum and cherry tomatoes by scrunching them through your clean hands over the pan
6. Add a handful of basil leaves (chopped) and the lemon juice, as well as one bay leaf (optional)
7. Let simmer for approximately 20 minutes till sauce thickens a bit. Season to taste with salt &amp; pepper
8. Squeeze the spinach, which should have cooled down by now, and chop it in small pieces. Discard the spinach water
9. In a big enough bowl, mix the spinach with the ricotta, an egg and a handful of grated Parmigiano Reggiano. Season to taste after thoroughly mixing it
10. Spread a bit of tomato sauce over the casserole pan
11. Start injecting the spinach-ricotta mix into the cannelloni (we used an icing-bag) and place them in the casserole pan
12. Pour all of the remaining tomato sauce evenly over all cannelloni and sprinkle with a teaspoon of oregano
13. Grate the cheese you want to use for the casserole's top: we used mozzarella \[4.4 oz / 125 g\], young gouda \[4.4 oz / 125 g\] and Parmigiano Reggiano \[2.8 oz / 80 g\]
14. Cover everything with the grated cheese and cook in pre-heated oven \[355°F / 180°C\] for 30-40 minutes. We put it on the lower third part of our electric top-down-heat oven an it turned out great. It might differ in your oven! If cheese darkens too quickly, cover with alu foil

Video tutorial: [https://youtu.be/4EzSX-BuWG0](https://youtu.be/4EzSX-BuWG0)

**Directions**

1. Break up the cake, add heavy cream and melted chocolate into the cake, it will make it stick together like dough.   
\*\* The ratio of the cream/melted chocolate to the cake is not fixed. I usually add a small amount at a time and roll it together, until it feels wet like a dough, and can be easily stuck together.
2. Melt the white chocolate, then fill the popsicle mold with it. Rotate the mold to spread the chocolate evenly, until it is covered all over the mold. Use a spatula to remove the excess chocolate.
3. Place strawberry slices on the mold, and then insert the popsicle sticks while the chocolate is still warm. 
4. Place the mold in the freezer for 5 minutes. Once take out again, add the second layer of chocolate to make sure the mold is fully covered. Freeze for another 5 minutes.
5. Add the cake dough in and gently press it to make sure it fills in all the gaps inside the mold.
6. Cover more melted chocolate on the top. Use a spatula to spread the chocolate evenly and then remove the excess.
7. Freeze for 5 minutes and it will be very easy to push the cakesicles out of the mold.  
\*\* If there is chocolate cover the strawberry slices, it would be a very thin layer and can be easily removed with a folk.
8. To decorate the cakesicles, add warm chocolate to a piping bag and fill around the edge between strawberry and chocolate. Add sprinkles on the top. The warm chocolate will work like glue and make the sprinkles stick to the cakesicle when it cools down. Enjoy!",1963

For full recipe, tips, tricks, and Q&amp;A, visit: https://maplewoodroad.com/food/crispy-chicken-burger/

**INGREDIENTS**  
**General**  
Two 12-oz chicken breasts, halved  
4 brioche buns  
4 slices American cheese  
1 c cole slaw  
1 Tbsp butter  
Vegetable oil for frying  
**Marinade (wet mix)**  
1-1/2 c buttermilk  
1 Tbsp hot sauce  
1 tsp paprika  
1 tsp onion powder  
1 tsp garlic powder  
1 tsp kosher salt  
1 tsp black pepper  
**Batter (dry mix)**  
1-1/2 c all-purpose flour  
2 Tbsp paprika  
1 tsp baking powder  
1 tsp cayenne pepper  
1 tsp onion powder  
1 tsp garlic powder  
1 tsp oregano  
1 tsp kosher salt  
1 tsp black pepper  


**INSTRUCTIONS** 

* Place the chicken on a large cutting board and dry them with a paper towel.
* Next, place plastic wrap over the chicken breast and, using a rolling pin, start pounding the thickest part of the breast, working your way around until you achieve an even thickness (about ½). Youll also end up with a larger piece of meat.
* Cut in half (each 12-oz chicken breast will result in two 6-oz crispy fried chicken sandwiches). 
* Season the chicken breasts with paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, kosher salt, and black pepper.
* Pour the buttermilk into a mixing bowl and add the hot sauce. Stir.
* Add the seasoned chicken to the bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and marinate in the fridge for a minimum of two hours, ideally overnight. 
* Important: Make sure to remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before dredging and frying them. Once I forgot and went ahead anyway. The result was as expected. When the chicken was perfectly fried on the outside, the internal temperature of the chicken was at a paltry 130°F. By the time it reached 160°F, the outside didnt look so golden crispy anymore.
* In a mixing bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, paprika, baking powder, cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, kosher salt, and black pepper. Mix well. Do not dredge the chicken yet. Instead, wait until the oil is ready (see next step).
* In a large enough frying pan to accommodate at least two halved chicken breasts, add enough oil to cover the bottom about ¾ deep.
* Carefully bring the temperature up to 350°F, checking with an instant-read thermometer.
* Once your oil reaches 350°F, lift a piece of chicken from the buttermilk and allow the excess to drip off a little, then place it in the flour and spice mixture. This dry mix must reach every nook and cranny of the meat to achieve a perfect crispy outside. Use your fingers to coat the chicken breast evenly. Gently shake off the excess batter and carefully lower it into the hot oil.
* Fry for about four minutes, turn, and fry for another four minutes. Use your instant-read thermometer to make sure the internal temperature of the chicken has reached 160°F. 
* In the meantime, have a cooling rack ready with a paper towel underneath. Once the chicken is at 160°F, remove with tongs and place on the cooling rack. 
* While the fried crispy chicken is resting on the cooling rack, butter up some brioche buns, add a slice of American cheese, and lightly toast in the toaster oven. Remove, add some coleslaw and a piece of chicken breast. Enjoy!",3233

Full credit goes to America's test Kitchen for this recipe, I saw their video, made it once, then I decided to make it for a video because I couldn't believe how good it was.  
  
  
Ingredients:  
\- Bittersweet Couverture Chocolate 60%-70% 130g  
\- Butter 130g  
\- Vanilla Extract 3/4 tsp  
\- 3 Egg Whites  
\- 3 Egg Yolks  
\- Sugar 150g (Split into 75g each)  
\- Almond Meal 150g  
\- 1.5 tbsp Cocoa Powder  
\- 1/2 tsp Salt  
\- Icing Sugar  

Recipe:  
\- Melt Chocolate and Butter over a double boiler or the microwave, add Vanilla Essence, set aside  
\- Beat the Egg Whites into stiff peaks, adding 75g sugar in stages while beating, set aside  
\- Beat the Egg Yolks and 75g Sugar until creamy and airy  
\- Add the Almond Meal, Salt &amp; Cocoa Powder and mix until combined  
\- Add 1/3 of Egg White and incorporate into the mix

\- Let it rest for 20 min, remove the springform lock  
\- Let it cool down for 2 hours, and decorate with Icing Sugar  
I know people are going to ask about the flourless, ""Gluten Free"" cake. I just saw the recipe and though it looked good, and honestly I like experimenting with other methods of cooking. The gluten free cakes that I've had before are usually not that good, but this looked good, I made it, and it was good!  
  
  
  
Notes:  
  
\- Spread the icing sugar further away from the cake to make it look better, I did it to close to the cake and it looked like a blizzard instead of a gentle snowfall  
  
\- Grease your pan with parchment. the first time I did it, I did it without the parchment and it was quite difficult to take it out.  
  
\- Eat it with Vanilla ice cream, please.

6. Take the dough and punch it down.   
Place it on the worktop, and divide it into 4 roughly equal pieces. You need to make a nice ball out of each piece.  
  
  
***Preheat the oven @ 185°C***
7. Place an oven rack in the oven, on the second level from the bottom.
8. While it heats, prepare whatever ingredients you want in your bun.

I made it, waiting for it to cool to taste... made some adjustments to fit my family's taste (nothing wrong with your recipe, just knew we would like something sweeter)

Here my take on your super cool recipe:

* 500 ml milk (2 cups)

* 100 grams sugar (1/2 cup)

* 2 egg yolks

* 55 grams corn starch (1/3 cup approx)

* 20 grams cream cheese (I used this more neutral option)

* 1/2 tsp cinnamon

* 1/4 tsp nutmeg

* splash of vanilla extract

I have made plenty of custard before so I went with my technique simply because I was more familiar with it

Directions:

* on a pot on low/med flame, add milk, sugar, cheese, cinnamon and nutmeg

* on a heat proof container, add egg yolks and cornstarch; mix to make slurry until no lumps remain

* heat milk until steam is visible; temper the eggs by adding small amounts of the heated milk to the egg yolks, mixing constantly

* when half the milk has been added to the eggs, return everything to the pot and back on the flame mixing constantly until thickened (it will be fast)

* add splash of vanilla extract and mix

* place mix into the fridge until fully set (I put it back into the original egg yolk container I used)

* once set, cut into pieces, arrange on a baking sheet

* Here I went crazy, instead of brushing with egg yolk, I top the pieces with some left over streusel mix I had (butter, sugar, cinnamon and oats)

* bake at 450 F for 5 minutes or until tops are golden

The sugar from the streusel melted and formed a thin but crunchy top... I hope it will contrast nicely with the creamy center of the baked milk pieces

*Serves 2*

**Ingredients:**

**The Syrup:**

*40ml whiskey*

*60ml dry white wine*

*juice of 2 clementines*

*juice of 1 small lemon*

*1 tsp. brown sugar*

*1 cinnamon stick*

**The Nectarines:**

*2 nectarines*

*4 tbsp. mascarpone*

*butter1 heaped tbsp. brown sugar*

*sprig of fresh mint*

*1 cinnamon stick*

*fresh grated nutmeg*

*handful chopped pistachios*

**Method:**

1.) Add all of the ingredients for the syrup into a small saucepan over a medium heat. Cook liquid until well reduced and thick. Keep your eye on it - it will stay consistent before bubbling up and quickly decreasing at a certain point. Set aside and allow to cool.

2.) Add 1 heaped tbsp. brown sugar with about 70m of water to a small saucepan over a medium heat and allow the sugar to dissolve. Add a small knob of butter and keep this simmering on allow heat for a hew minutes.

3.) Place a large knob of butter in a frying pan, enough to coat the surface. Set the pan to medium heat and allow butter to melt and heat up before adding the cinnamon stick and sliced nectarines, skin side up. Let the face of the fruits caramelise and take on some colour for about 2 minutes. Mind that your butter does not darken too much, turning the heat down if necessary.

4.) Grate fresh nutmeg over the nectaries. Turn them over and add the brown sugar and water mixture into the pan. If the sugar hardens add a little more water into the pan. Spoon the mixture over the top and cook the nectarines down, turning as necessary until they are soft all the way through while still holding their shape.

5.) Serve the nectarines with freshly torn mint leaves , a pinch of cinnamon and a generous dollop of mascarpone to top. Add a scattering of crushed pistachios, salted are nice. Spoon the syrup over the top and add the zest of a grated lemon.",2342
2021-06-16,11,"Extremely easy Salmon en Croute - Coulibiac","CakesAndTips","Hello

This is my [Salmon En Croute](https://youtu.be/PRHWj8vFzo0) recipe, it is really easy! I hope you enjoy.

**Ingredients:**  
  
700g fresh salmon skinless boneless and thick  
700g fresh spinach leaves  
2 puff pastry sheets of about 300g each  
  
*Marinade:*  
4 Table spoons Olive Oil  
Juice of 1 lemon  
Dill - fresh or dried  


*For the spinach:*  
4 Table spoons Olive Oil  
  
**Directions**

Mix lemon, olive oil and dill and let it marinade.  
  
In the meantime, prepare the melted spinach. In a very large skillet, heat the olive oil and add the cleaned and dried spinach leaves. Stir constantly and cook for about 10 minutes, until wilted. You can season with salt and pepper, I usually dont because both the salmon and puff pastry will already be salty.  
  
Preheat the oven to 180°C with the fan.  
  
Whilst the oven heats, assemble the pie.  
  
1.Place one pastry sheet on the baking parchment. I like to stretch it and to smooth it out a little.

2.Place the spinach in the middle of the pastry, and the salmon on top.  
  
3.Wrap using the other puff pastry sheet and seal them well. You can use water to help seal, but I dont find it necessary. It is really important to score lines, not just to decorate but to allow the steam to escape.  
  
You could add an egg wash, but usually its nice and golden without.  
  
4. Finally, place the baking paper on an oven rack, and put the rack in the lower half of the oven. This way, it will cook evenly.  
  
It will take about 35/45 minutes to cook depending on how thick your salmon piece was.

Hello! This week I had some sweet mangos that were about to go bad and I had a great plating idea I thought up that I wanted to see in realtime so I decided to make mango sticky rice! I wanted to make mango roses floating in a sea of sauce, but using white sugar wouldn't give me the contrast I was aiming for. My version uses coconut sugar which gives you the more brown color rather than the usual white you would achieve with regular sugar. I personally like the coconut sugar version, but lmk what you think and prefer! This recipe is more for the sauce, you will have to do separate research on how to make sticky rice.

If you would like to visually follow along [CLICK HERE](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMu0kzvpXR3/)

  
*Serving Size x2*  
**INGREDIENTS:**

* 2 cups coconut milk
* 2/3 cup coconut sugar (add/reduce based on desired sweetness)
* 1 tbsp corn starch
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 cups cooked sticky rice
* 2 sweet mangos

**FOR GARNISH:**

* Roasted sesame seeds
* Roasted coconut flakes

  
**BREAKDOWN:**  


1. In a pan, combine coconut milk, coconut sugar, salt, and corn starch.
2. Stir on medium high heat until it comes to a simmer and sauce reduces to a thicker consistency

**MAZE GOHAN / ÷\Tï**  
2 cups Rice  
Shiitake Mushrooms (4 or 5)  
Seasonal Mushrooms (1/2 - 1 cup)  
1 Carrot  
1/2 cup sliced Bamboo (any seasonal vegetable)  
200 grams Chicken (preferably leg meat)  
2 tablespoons Soy Sauce  
2 tablespoons Mirin (or 1 teaspoon sugar, 2 tablespoons sake)  
2 tablespoons Sake (this is said to negate any odor)  
Salt to taste  
1 cups strong Dashi  

      
(note: the amount of vegetables and chicken is not precisely measured.)    
      
1. Wash the rice and set aside. Doing this will partly hydrate the rice which is said to improve the texture and flavor. After 15 minutes, cook the rice. You can add a piece of kombu (kelp) to add flavor to the rice. 
 
2. Slice the vegetables and set aside.  
(note: people add a seasonal vegetable such as kabocha or chestnuts in the fall, so feel free to add something local to personalize the dish.)  
     
3. Remove the skin from the chicken, set aside.  
     
4. Slice the chicken, without skin, into bite sized pieces and add the soy sauce, mirin, and sake.  
     
5. Prepare your dashi.    
     
6. Now that all of your ingredients are ready, heat a wok or deep pan. Stretch the chicken skin and put it onto the hot pan to render the fat from the skin. You will cook the ingredients in the hot chicken fat to give the dish flavor.  
    
When the fat is rendered remove the skin, salt it and set it aside as a garnish.  
      
7. Place the rest of the ingredients into the pot in any order.   
      
8. Add the dashi.  
      
9. Cook for about 15 minutes or until the liquid has reduced by 3/4.  
      
10. Turn off the heat and fold your rice into the mixture and incorporate it.  
(note: If you feel there is too much liquid, turn on the heat and evaporate off some of the moisture.)    
      
11. Serve.   
  
12. You can crush the chicken skin and top the maze-gohan with it if you like.",2180

**EQUIPMENT**  
9"" x 9"" square cake pan  
Large roasting pan that will fit the cake pan inside  


**INGREDIENTS**  
3/4 c cake flour, sifted  
1/4 c cocoa powder  
2/3 c whole milk  
2 oz dark chocolate, chopped  
1/2 tsp vanilla extract  
1/4 c neutral oil  
6 large eggs, separated  
1/4 tsp salt  
1/2 c granulated sugar  
Dark chocolate chips  
Cooking spray (like Pam)  
Boiling water

  
**INSTRUCTIONS**   
\-Preheat oven to 325°F and start a pot of boiling water on the stove.  
\-In a small bowl, mix flour and cocoa.  
\-In another bowl, mix together the milk, dark chocolate, vanilla extract, and oil. Microwave in 30-second increments, stirring between each time, until smooth (the mixture will still be runny...this is normal).  
\-Whisk 6 egg yolks into the chocolate mixture.  
\-Then, add flour mixture to the chocolate and stir well.  
\-Next, using either an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with whisk attachment, whisk together egg whites and salt at medium speed until it becomes foamy.  
\-At that point, add the sugar, turn up the speed to high, and whisk until soft peaks to make a meringue.  
\-Add the meringue it to the chocolate batter, one-third at a time, gently folding it in until the color is uniform and there are no white streaks.  
\-Prepare a 9 x 9 baking dish by spraying it with cooking spray, then lining the bottom and sides with parchment paper, then spraying the parchment paper with the cooking spray again. Make sure to leave handles of parchment sticking up the sides, as youll use these handles to lift the cake out of the pan after baking.  
\-Pour the cake batter into the lined and greased 9 x 9 pan, using a spatula to level the top.  
\-With the pan sitting on the counter, lightly drop it three times. This will break up any air bubbles.  
\-At this point, prepare the bain-marie: Place the 9 x 9 baking dish into the roasting pan, then carefully pour the boiling water into the roasting pan until it reaches about 13 up the sides of the baking dish. If you prefer, you can also place the baking dish in the roasting pan, then place everything in the oven, then add the boiling water.  
\-Bake for 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  
\-Immediately lift the cake out of the pan using the handles of parchment paper.  
\-Then, while the cake is still hot, drop some dark chocolate chips on top.  
\-Let the cake cool for only a few minutes. Remove the parchment and wrap the hot cake tightly in plastic wrap (to seal in the moisture) and place in the refrigerator for several hours until cool.  
\-To serve, cut into 13 slices and enjoy with tea or coffee.",2842

2021-06-09,66,"Braised Pork Rice Bowl Recipe - Melt in your Mouth!","ForteFZ","as someone who has been playing around with this type of dish a while now (and love it, please everyone give this a try its so comforting), i will warn that depending on the recipe you use, some may find it too salty, while others will be fine - when im in taiwan some places serve a version that is very potent and delicious, and served a different sauce to rice ratio because the flavors stretch out that long. So you'll find a range of flavor strengths that cater to how much else you may be eating with it!

Other versions (i believe northern taiwan is more towards this) use just minced pork and may add in pork fat/skin portions to their own tastes, and these versions also taste absolutely delicious - dont feel worried if you cant find pork belly.

Personally, i love it served with any pickle! traditional pickled mustard greens, soy pickled cucumbers, kimchi, viet sweet pickled radishes and carrots, pickled red onions - i dont actually love pickles, but with a dish as luxurious and rich as this, i think it elevates to a new level.

Tea eggs are also a classic, but i sometimes just love an over-easy egg cracked on top of it.

Thank you OP for reminding me of this gem of a dish, im going to make it again next week. This week i made a somewhat similar chicken dish version of this called "" Ji Rou Fan.""

Edit: Oh my gosh how could i forget, this sauce is SO versatile. It doesnt just transform rice into something else, it goes so nicely on top of clear broth noodles or noodle soups in general. It really is a dish so very close to the hearts of many of the Taiwanese. My closest comparison i could think of to this would be a wonderfully deep and rich beef ragu or bolognese sauce.",1698

* 4 sheets of Phyllo Dough 
* 4 slices of Prosciutto
* 2 tablespoons of Butter
* 1 sprig of Fresh Rosemary 
* 1 tablespoon Fig Jam 

**DIRECTIONS**

1. **WRAP BRIE IN PROSCIUTTO**

**a.** Preheat oven to 350F/180C. Place 2 tablespoons of butter in a ramekin and place in the oven to melt.  
  
**b.** Start with placing slices of prosciutto in a circular shape, or like a flower, on a cutting board. Place your brie wheel in the center and gently start wrapping it with prosciutto. 

**c.** Add more slices if needed to cover whole cheese. See the pictures below to help you with this step. Nicely chop the rosemary and sprinkle all over wrapped brie. Set it aside.

This step does sound intimidating, so use my tips below to ensure you will master this process from the first try! I have phyllo dough cooking tips in my full recipe on the blog. 

**a.** Thaw completely, otherwise layers will break before you touch them.

**b.** Cover all phyllo sheets except the one you currently working on with a damp kitchen towel.

**c.**  Generously brush each sheet with melted butter. Use it as the glue between layers.  

**3. WRAP BRIE IN PHYLLO DOUGH**

I call it the midnight storm. For the concept of this drink I wanted to create something super simple but visually pleasing, I was thinking how I could achieve this and remembered butterfly pea flower tea! So with that in mind I decided to base it around the theme of blue. I incorporated fresh blueberries and used blueberry soju/vodka (whichever you have access to), sprite, and butterfly pea flower tea. The end result gave a beautiful layered effect. I chose to go with a spherical ice cube because it gives a representation of the moon lost in the butterfly pea flower tea which represents the midnight storm. As for the crushed blueberries and the soju/vodka sprite mixture it represents the ocean and reflection of the sky!

**INGREDIENTS**

1 lb ground beef

2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

1 small yellow onion (1 cup)

2 cloves garlic, minced (1 Tbsp)

28-oz can whole San Marzano plum tomatoes

3 oz tomato paste

8 oz fresh mozzarella cheese, cubed

4 oz Pecoroni Romano, grated

8 oz rigatoni

1/4 c pasta water

1/2 tsp kosher salt

1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper

2 Tbsp fresh Italian flat leaf parsley, chopped

**INSTRUCTIONS**

\-Preheat the oven to 375°F.

\-Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a skillet.

\-Add the ground beef. With a wooden spoon, break apart any clumps. Season with 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper.

\-After browning the ground beef for about 5 minutes over medium heat, add the chopped onions and mix. Cook for another 5 minutes, until the ground beef has nicely browned and the onions become translucent.

\-Add the minced garlic for just a minute.

\-Add the whole can of plum tomatoes (including any juices) and 3 oz of tomato paste. Bring to a simmer. Stir regularly and use tongs to help break apart the plum tomatoes.

\-In between stirring the sauce, finely grate 4 oz Pecorino Romano and cut 8 oz mozzarella into 1/2 cubes.

\-Keep simmering and stirring the pot  smell, taste. Be careful with the salt. If it tastes just slightly under-salted, thats perfect. The salty Pecorino Romano will close that gap when added before baking.

\-In the meantime, bring a pot of salted water to boil, add 8 oz rigatoni, and cook. Before draining the pasta, scoop out 1/4 c of the pasta water and add to the sauce.

\-Now were ready to put everything together and finish cooking in the oven. If you made the sauce in an oven-safe skillet, add the grated Pecorino Romano cheese and the cooked pasta. Mix well. Top with cubed mozzarella and in the oven it goes. Bake for 30 minutes. Otherwise, transfer the sauce to a baking dish, mix everything as above, and bake.

\-Once its ready to serve, remove from the oven and start heaping it on plates. Garnish with some roughly chopped fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley.",2212
2021-06-07,10,"Indonesian Vegetable Fritters (Bakwan)","simply_flavour","Hi everyone, I've seen a lot of Korean vegetable fritters/pancakes recipes in this sub, but I've never seen an Indonesian version, so I set out to make it. The ingredients are very simple and this is considered a ""side"" dish. Usually the ones you get in ""warungs"" or food stalls are either these ones or the corn versions. You can literally replace the vegetables here with corn and achieve Indonesian Corn Fritters. It stays crunchy for a good couple of hours so you have plenty of time to eat it. TBH, even the ones that have been left out still tastes nice to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients:  
  
Vegetables:  
  
\- 1 Carrot  
  
\- 1/4 Cabbage  
  
\- 2 Stalks Green Onion (Scallion)  
  
\- 2 Stalks Celery Leaves  
  
\- 2 Chilis (Bird's Eye &amp; Normal) (Optional)  
  
Garlic Paste::  
  
\- 3 Cloves Garlic  
  
\- 3 Candlenuts (can replace with other nuts)  
  
\- 1 tsp Salt  
  
\- 1 tsp Coriander Powder  
  
\- 1 tsp Mushroom Powder (or MSG)  
  
\- 1/2 tsp White Pepper  
  
Batter:  
  
\- 1 Cup All Purpose Flour  
  
\- 1/2 Cup Rice Flour  
  
\- Enough Water (\~ 1 Cup)  
  
Recipe:  
  
\- Prepare the vegetables, Dice and chop the Cabbage, Green Onion, Celery Leaves and Chilis. Julienne (or try to) the Carrot  
  
\- Pound the ingredients for the garlic paste (you can use a food processor, or even your knife)  
  
\- Mix the vegetables and paste together with the Flours and just enough water to make it a thick consistency  
  
\- Fry Globs of the batter into medium heat oil, you can use a mold too but I like the uneven texture globs give, Heterogeneity! (cough - Adam Ragusea - cough)  
  
\- Enjoy with a bite of raw bird's Eye Chili (if you dare)  
  
Notes:  
  
\- You can replace the candlenuts with other types of nuts, like cashews. I used candlenuts because it is typically used in Indonesia for Bakwans, and I wanted to stay true to it.  
  
\- Yes you can omit the chilis, Bird's Eye Chili is pretty hot, at least 10-15x hotter than jalapenos, you can replace it with normal chilis too

2021-06-06,83,"Chicken Tandoori with Vegetable Biryani &amp; Cucumber Raita","mienczaczek","Indian food is so aromatic...  
  
I love the variety of spices used in that cuisine, not to mention their health benefits.  
  
From all the South Asian dishes Chicken Tandoori is definitely one of my favourites, especially when served on fragrant rice like Biryani. Enjoy cooking!  
  
The secret of the best Chicken Tandoori is the meat quality and marinating time.  
  
The longer marinating period the better. It gives the meat enough time to absorb all those beautiful flavours!  
  
Remember to always pick the meat from suppliers that do respect animal welfare, if you cannot afford it try to eat less meat but better sourced.  
  
Making cuts in the meat helps the marinade to penetrate deeper, thus giving a better result.  
  
Serves 3 hungry heads  
  


**Ingredients for Chicken Tandoori:**  
  
3 good quality chicken legs  
  
3 tbsp of natural yoghurt  
  
1/2tsp of salt  
  
half lemon juice and zest  
  
3tsp of garlic and ginger paste  
  
2tbsp of Kashmiri mild chilli powder (if you are not a big fan of spicy food substitute with 2tbsp of paprika)  
  
1tsp of turmeric  
  
1/2tsp ground coriander  
  
1tbsp oil  
  


**Instructions for Chicken Tandoori:**  
  
1.Prepare the chicken by removing the skin and separating the drumstick from the thigh. Next, make three deep cuts on each side of the pieces (This helps marinate to penetrate deeper)  
  
2.Place the chicken in the bowl and rub with 1/2 lemon juice and 1/2tsp of salt.  
  
3.Mix remaining marinade ingredients and rub in the meat.  
  
4.Place in the fridge for 24 hours (2 hours minimum if you in the rush)  
  
5.To cook the chicken, preheat the oven to a 220C fan (428F) setting and place the meat on a flat tray with some baking paper. Once the oven is hot, roast the chicken for 30 minutes on one side, flip to another, and continue on the grill setting for another 10-15 minutes.  
  
6.Rest under foil for 5 minutes before serving.  
  


**Ingredients for Vegetable Biryani:**  
  
300g (10.6oz) of extra long basmati rice  
  
2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil  
  
1 small cinnamon stick  
  
7 cardamom pods  
  
7 cloves  
  
1 star anise  
  
1 medium red onion, sliced

1 medium carrot, sliced  
  
80g (2.8oz) of green beans, sliced  
  
1/2tsp of salt  
  
1tsp garam masala  
  
1/2tsp turmeric  
  
1/2tsp Kashmiri mild chilli powder  
  
1/2tsp ground cumin  
  
5 curry leaves (optional)  
  
3tbsp of natural yoghurt  
  
half lemon juice and zest  
  
550ml (0.6quarts) of vegetable stock

  
  
**Instructions for Biryani:**  
  
1.Soak the washed rice in water for 30-50 minutes.  
  
2.In a large frying pan or a pot, medium heat 2tbsp of ghee and fry aromatics for 2 minutes (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and star anise)  
  
3.Next, add sliced red onion, sliced green chilli and garlic and ginger paste, cook for 5 minutes.  
  
4.Turn up the heat and add 2 diced potatoes, sliced carrot and green beans, season with 1/2tsp of salt and cook until starts to brown (10 minutes)  
  
5.Lower the heat and mix in garam masala, turmeric, mild chilli powder and cumin.  
  
6.Add 5 curry leaves, 3tbsp of natural yoghurt, rice and 550ml of vegetable stock, bring to a boil and reduce to simmer, cover with a lid and continue cooking for around 15 minutes or until rice absorbs all the liquid.  
  
7.Once ready, mix it with a spoon, cover with a lid and rest for another 15 minutes.  
  
8.Your Biryani is ready to be served, drizzle with lemon juice and zest, adjust the saltiness if necessary. Enjoy!  
  


**Ingredients for Cucumber Raita:**  
  
150g (5.3oz) of natural yoghurt  
  
100g (3.5oz) of grated cucumber  
  
half a green chilli, thinly sliced  
  
a handful of coriander  
  
black pepper to garnish  
  


**Instructions for Raita:**  
  
Mix all the ingredients together and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes in the fridge before serving.  
  


**Insight:**  
  
When cooking chicken legs the core temperature should reach 80C (176F) significantly higher than a breast meat 72C (162F)  
  
Remember to rest the meat after cooking, this helps the juices to redistribute in each piece.  
  
Soaking rice helps it to absorb moisture inside each grain. This helps to cook quicker and better.

This recipe comes together in about 10 minutes so its perfect for a quick and satisfying meal! So much tastier than just making instant noodles with the soup mix. Its super easy to prepare just one serving, so I made this dish for myself all the time when I lived alone. Its also just as easy to double (or triple, and so on) to feed a group.

Its great with both ramen or udon noodles, and each option ends up tasting pretty different, so I recommend trying them both out!

# Stir-Fried Instant Noodles

Serves: 1

**Ingredients**

* 1 pack instant ramen (3 oz) or instant udon (7 oz) 
* ½ cup shredded cabbage (I use bagged tricolor coleslaw mix) 
* 1 green onion, green &amp; white portions chopped and separated 
* 1 tsp freshly minced garlic 
* 2 tsp toasted sesame oil \*see note 
* 1 tbsp soy sauce (use 2 tbsp to make it extra saucy) 
* ½ tsp light brown sugar 
* Sesame seeds, for topping (optional)

**Notes**

* Toasted sesame oil has a low smoke point, when using it in stir fry its best to keep the heat to medium and the cook times short (per the recipe).

**Instructions**

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil for the ramen or udon. As the water boils, prep the other ingredients.
2. Discard seasoning packet and boil the ramen or udon noodles until they become loose and separate from each other (slightly under the recommended cook time on the package).
3. Warm the sesame oil in a skillet over medium heat, once warm add the minced garlic and onion whites and cook for 1 minute, then add the drained noodles and stir fry everything together for another minute.
4. Add soy sauce and brown sugar to the skillet and mix well to combine. Cook for another minute, then add the cabbage and cook for 1 minute more, until the cabbage has wilted slightly.
5. Remove from heat and serve immediately topped with the green onion greens and sesame seeds.",1923

Ingredients:

-7lb bone-in skinless pork shoulder

-5 cloves garlic, crushed

-1 inch piece of ginger, thinly sliced

-2 green onion

-2/3cup hoisin sauce

-1/3cup rice wine

-1/2cup honey

-1/2cup soy sauce

-1tsp white pepper

-2tsp star anise powder

-red food dye, optional

Instructions:

 1. Make the marinade by pouring 2/3cup hoisin sauce, 1/3cup rice wine, 1/2cup honey, 1/2cup soy sauce, 1tsp white pepper, and 2tsp star anise powder in a cup/bowl.  Add red food dye if you want that classic char siu look.  Stir to combine.
 
2. Place the pork shoulder in a sealable bag or pot.  Add in the garlic, ginger, and green onion.  Then pour in the marinade.  Remove any excess air from the bag and seal tight.
 
3. Let the pork marinade for 12-24 hours in the fridge.  The longer the better.

4. When the pork is done marinating, pour the leftover marinade into a saucepan.

5. Cook the pork in a preheated 250F oven for about 12 hours or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 200F.  Cooking time will vary depending on the pork's weight and your oven.  You can also use a grill or smoker instead of the oven.  Cover the pork with foil after about an hour to prevent burning.
 
6. While the pork cooks, bring the marinade to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce the marinade into a sauce until you achieve your desired thickness.  Keep in mind the marinade will thicken after it cools.  Remove the garlic, ginger, and green onion when done and let cool before storing in the fridge.
 
7. After the pork is done, remove the shoulder bone and pull the meat apart using two forks.
 
8. Enjoy the pulled pork with the sauce as is or in BBQ pork buns, sandwiches, salads, or rice bowls.",1934

No mess baked Eggplant Parmesan Towers is a lifesaver if you are looking for a fast yet elegant side dish idea. This recipe is so easy, and the result is over the top delicious. Paired with any protein or served on its own, my Eggplant Parmesan will become your favorite!

INGREDIENTS

* 1 large Eggplant  
* 3 Beef Steak Tomatoes  
* 16 oz Whole Milk Mozzarella Cheese  
* 1 cup Bread Crumbs  
* 1 cup Marinara Sauce  
* 1 tablespoon Dried Herbs Blend  
* 4 cloves Garlic  
* to taste Salt  
* to taste Pepper  
* for garnish Parmesan Cheese  
* for garnish Fresh Parsley

DIRECTIONS

1. Slice eggplant into 1/2 inch circles. To get rid of bitterness sprinkle salt on each slice and let it sit for 10 minutes. This trick is my go-to when cooking with this vegetable. You can use this time to prep tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.


2. Wash each eggplant slice to remove salt and dry with a paper towel.
  
3. Mix bread crumbs with salt, pepper, and dry herbs blend in a little shallow plate or like I did in a baking tray. Chop garlic and mix with melted butter or olive oil.
  
4. Brush each slice of eggplant with garlic and oil mix on each side and dip it into seasoned bread crumbs. Place on a large baking sheet and send to the bottom rack of your oven with Broiling mode set on high.


5. While waiting on breaded eggplant slices to get golden brown, slice each tomato into 1/3 of inch circles. Cut mozzarella cheese into 1 X 1 inch blocks, about 1/2 inch thick.


6. Use leftover garlic pieces from the oil you used to brush eggplant slices and mix them with any Marinara sauce of your choice. Now it is time to assemble our owers!  

7. Use a deep baking dish and cover its bottom with our sauce. Place the first layer of breaded eggplant circles, cover with tomato slices, then mozzarella, then add a little bit of sauce on top and repeat 2 more times. Finish the third layer of eggplant with double cheese and send it to the middle rack of your oven at 400 F for 15 minutes.


8. Right before 15 minutes are done, take it out and grate a little bit of parmesan cheese, add parsley and return for 1 more minute, which will allow the cheese to melt.  
Serve hot! This Eggplant Parmesan recipe is perfect for any occasion, will pair well with chicken or beef. It also makes an amazing vegetarian option at the party table. Enjoy and remember that sometimes cheating is absolutely fine!",2521

2021-06-03,98,"Fool-Proof Chinese Soup Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) Recipe","cookingwithRobin","Xiao long bao are also known as ""soup dumplings"" in English speaking countries as they are essentially small buns filled with meat and hot soup. As the name implies, they are extremely juicy, savory, and quite special.

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/FUb_t3bzPEw)

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is it fool-proof?**

I found that the most challenging part of making xiao long bao is how to make the skin super thin, like almost translucent. An easy solution is to use a pasta maker! In addition, traditionally, the soup inside xiao long bao is created by wrapping solid meat jelly usually made from pig skin, and the heat from steaming will melt the meat jelly into soup. However, this recipe is meant to be super easy and also tasty, so here I am using chicken broth. Add the chicken broth (120ml) into the meat filling (150g), keep stirring until all the chicken broth is absorbed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

Dough:

\- 115g all-purpose flour

\- 1 tbsp (15ml) oil

\- 2oz (60ml) water

Filling:

\- 150g 70-80% lean ground pork

\- 1 tbsp Chinese cooking wine

\- 1 tbsp soy sauce

\- 1 tsp (5ml) sesame oil

\- 1g salt

\- 1g sugar

\- 1g black pepper

\- 3g ginger (finely chopped)

\- 1 scallion (finely chopped, optional)

\- 4-5oz (120-150ml) chicken broth

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. **Dough:** Mix the flour, salt, oil, and water together to form a soft dough and let it rest for at least one hour to form the gluten strands.
2. **Filling:** Add all the spices as listed above into the meat filling. Add the chicken broth, keep stirring until all the chicken broth is absorbed. Put them in the refrigerator for later use.
3. **How to make translucent wrappers:** Divide the dough into 3 pieces, run them through a pasta maker, adjust the knob until it is at number 7. The dough will become paper thin, use a cup or a cutter (4.5 inches in diameter) to make round wrappers. Make sure to flour them to prevent sticking. The amount of ingredients I used here can make 18 wrappers.
4. **How to wrap the soup dumpling:** Place one tablespoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper, pick up one spot, fold and pinch, fold and pinch, keep repeating this step to make one soup dumpling (xiao long bao).
5. **Cooking:** Bring the water to a rolling boil, steam the soup dumplings for about 10 minutes using medium to high heat.
6. **How to eat the soup dumpling:** Take a tiny bite out of the skin, slurp the soup out of the xiao long bao, dip it into the black vinegar gently and finish the whole thing off in one bite!

**Notes:**

1. In the dough recipe, the oil will make the xiao long bao skin tender and smooth.
2. Because xiao long bao is filled with only meat, dipping them into black vinegar will make you feel less fatty.
3. I also prefer the chicken stock than the traditional pig skin soup, the pig skin soup will be greasier and fattier than this.",2929

2021-06-02,28,"Crispy baked chickpeas","fuzzician","**recipe for crispy baked chickpeas**

*makes as many servings as you like!*

&amp;#x200B;

**ingredients**

"" dried chickpeas  as many as you like (I usually go for 2-3 handfuls of dried chickpeas)

"" olive oil

"" fine salt

"" dried herbs &amp; spices of your choosing

&amp;#x200B;

**directions**

1. Put your dried **chickpeas** in a large bowl, cover abundantly with cool **water**, sprinkle with **salt**, and let soak for 8+ hours. In a pinch, you can soak them in just-boiled water for at least an hour. You want them to be quite plump, and they should more than double in size, so make sure youve got enough room in your bowl for their expansion. In terms of salt-to-chickpea ratios, youll want to add to the water **up to 3/4 tsp of fine salt** (thats 3.7mL, if youre feeling precise) **per cup of dried chickpeas** (roughly 240mL).
2. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 210°C (410°F). Drain your chickpeas well, give em a little shake to get rid of more water, and spread them out evenly on a large baking sheet  taking care to avoid too many of the chickpeas touching one another.
3. You can rub your chickpeas very sparingly with **olive oil** and sprinkle them lightly with **salt** prior to baking, but this isnt absolutely necessary. Dry roasting also works well.
4. Put the tray in the centre of the oven, bake for 10 minutes, then turn the heat down to 190°C (375°F) and let bake for a further 15 minutes, until they are a deep golden colour.
5. While still hot, thinly coat the chickpeas in **olive oil** so any seasoning you choose to sprinkle on them will stick. Sprinkle from high above for better distribution, and roll the chickpeas around to ensure even coating. Start with a small amount, taste a chickpea, and adjust your seasoning (you can always add more, but you can't take it away). Personally, I find **salt**, **garlic powder** and **smoked chipotle** to be an absolutely delicious (and uncomplicated) combination.

&amp;#x200B;

**notes**

Oven temperatures can vary quite a bit, but keeping an ear out for your chickpeas will help you determine whether the temperature is right   if a few chickpeas occasionally pop here and there, youre okay. If they start exploding all over the place, turn the heat down!

2021-06-02,46,"Death by Chocolate Cake!","MessInTheKitchen","You can find the full recipe and chocolate measurements [here](https://messinthekitchen.com/death-by-chocolate-cake/)!  
**Ingredients**

  
Chocolate Cake

  
2 tsp instant espresso powder\*  
1 cup water hot  
2 cups flour all-purpose  
2 cups granulated sugar  
3/4 cups cocoa powder  
2 tsp baking powder  
1 tsp baking soda  
1 tsp salt  
1 cup buttermilk  
1/2 cup vegetable oil  
2 large eggs  
1 tbsp vanilla extract

  
Chocolate Buttercream

  
1 1/2 cups butter unsalted, room temperature  
2 tsp vanilla extract  
4 1/2 cups icing sugar  
3/4 cup cocoa powder  
3-5 tbsp milk

  
Chocolate Ganache

  
1 cup chocolate chips  
1 cup whipping cream  
US Customary  Metric

  
**Instructions**

  
Chocolate Cake

  
Preheat the oven to 350F. Prepare two 8 or 9"" round cake pans by spraying them lightly with cooking spray, and lining them with parchment paper.  
Sift the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a mixing bowl and whisk until well combined.

  
Whisk the instant espresso powder and hot water in a large mixing bowl, then add the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. Mix until well combined. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until you no longer see flour.

  
Disperse the batter evenly between the two cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean. Let the cakes cool completely to room temperature.

  
Chocolate Buttercream

  
Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, whip the butter and vanilla until light and fluffy. Sift the powdered sugar and cocoa to the bowl and, starting on LOW speed, beat until just combined.  
Increase the speed to medium-high and continue to beat until the cocoa and sugar are well combined. Add the milk, 1 tbsp at a time, until you reach your desired consistency.  
Chocolate Ganache

  
Add the chocolate chips to a small bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan until it just bubbles around the edges. Remove from the heat and pour over the chips. Let it stand for 1 minute, then whisk until smooth.  
  
**How to assemble your cake like mine**

   
Let the cake cool down FULLY! This is so important. It will melt the buttercream otherwise. You can even let the cake cool fully in the fridge to be safe. Once it has reached room temperature, cover it with plastic so that it doesnt dry out if you arent going to decorate right away.

  
Remove the cakes from their pans and peel the parchment paper from the bottoms of the cake. Use a bread or cake knife to slice the dome off the cakes. Work slowly to make sure the cake stays level.

  
You can keep this cake in two layers, or four like mine. No matter how many layers you end up with, make sure to layer it as such: Place a round of cake with the smooth, bottom side DOWN and the sliced side UP. Smooth a level layer of buttercream over the cake.

  
If youre making two layers, the top layer should be flipped upside down to the smooth, uncut side is facing UP. To make 4 layers, layer the inner pieces of cake with buttercream and finish with the bottom, smooth round facing UP. This will ensure your cake is perfectly smooth and level.

  
Cover the entire cake with a layer of buttercream. Use a cake spatula or even a butter knife to smooth the buttercream as you see fit.

&amp;#x200B;

  
If the ganache has hardened a bit, you can microwave it for 10-second intervals, stirring in between, until it is warm, not hot. Pour the ganache over the top of the cake and carefully to the edges just until you get a few drips. Work around the edge of the cake until you are happy with the drips.

  
Optional: I had some extra buttercream so I added it to a piping bag and added some decoration on top with chocolate chips.",3783

2021-05-31,21,"Chocolate Filled Wool Roll Bread (Buns) (No egg)","simply_flavour","Hi guys, this is a twist on the trending wool roll bread that you see on the internet these days (made famous by Apron I think). Anyway I saw their video and was fascinated by it, so I set out to make it, but smaller and filled with chocolate. I also set out to make an eggless version of the bread. I think it turned out pretty well. They were soft and fluffy and the chocolate was not overpowering!  
  
  
Ingredients:  
\- Milk 240 ml  
\- Sugar 40 gms  
\- Yeast 6 gms  
\- Bread Flour 320 gms  
\- Salt 3 gms  
\- Softened Butter 55 gms  
\- Bittersweet Chocolate   

Recipe:  
\- Mix Sugar, Milk &amp; Yeas until the sugar is completely dissolved  
\- Add Bread Flour &amp; Salt  
\- Mix until combined  
\- Add Butter and knead for 10 Minutes (Machine) or 15 Minutes (Hand)  
\- Place in a greased bowl and rest until double in size (45 Minutes - 1 Hour)  
\- Punch the air out  
\- Divide into 8 balls  
\- Roll each ball into a long oblong shape  
\- Cut strands (but don't cut it off) on half of the dough  
\- Add Chocolate (chips, coins, bar) into the uncut end  
\- Roll from the uncut end into a long bun shape (almost like a hot dog bun)  
\- Make sure the strands cover the whole rolled up dough  
\- Pinch the ends and strands so the chocolate does not leak out  
\- Place in a greased baking pan, preferable on that is a cuboid shape  
\- Let rest and proof for 20 min  
\- Bake for 20-25 minutes in 170°-180°C  
\- Brush with butter right after taking it out of oven  
\- Enjoy  


Notes:  
  
\- I think brushing salted butter at the end really brings something to the table, if you don't have salted butter, sprinkle some salt on top of the bread at the end.  
  
\- Make sure the dough passes the window pane test after kneading it, it doesn't need to be super stretchy, just enough so that you can see the outline of your fingers when you touch it.  
  
\- Use bittersweet chocolate, or dark chocolate here. Or if you prefer sweet stuff, I guess milk chocolate is also alright.

### How to make fresh pasta (simplified)


To make pasta you need to mix water and flour, its a very easy pasta but I cant give quantities as the amount of water heavily depends on the specific flour and the the season. 

What I can say is to keep adding water until the dough is well mixed, elastic but very tied together.  

It doesnt have to be elastic in a springy way but it neither has to tear while working it. Keep in mind you need to stop working the dough while its a bit stiffer than how it should ideally be, because it tends to relax while resting. 

When the dough is ready you can leave it resting in the fridge for 30 mins to 12 hours.

After resting you can roll out the dough to the right thickness according to the shape of pasta youre making: for maltagliati,  which is the shape you see in the pic, you want to stay pretty thick at 3 mm. 

Finally you want to cut it and dust the pasta with durum wheat flour, which doesnt bond to pasta unlike AP flour.

Then you can cook the pasta in salted boiling water until it comes to the surface, fresh pasta usually takes no longer then 3 mins. 


### how to be a nerd about fresh pasta

I dont know how to describe the pasta making experience because practice plays a huge role in it, you have to feel the dough and I think the best way I can tell you how to make good pasta is reporting step by step how I do it and what I look for and notice while doing it.

Please notice that I wont be talking about egg pasta, thats a whole different creature and it deserves its own spot. 

*Step 1: the right ingredients*

Pasta doesnt involve many ingredients so they need to be top notch. 

As for water theres not much to say, use bottled, avoid tap and youre good to go: I prefer sparkling but cant notice difference actually, might just be my thing. 

Flour on the other hand is crucial: you need to find one you like but my hint would be to stick to 0/00 flour and to avoid the strong kind.
As you practice you can add durum wheat flour to the mix or even make the dough 100% out of it, you need to find your sweet spot and what you like best.  
Usually durum wheat leads to a more nervosa pasta: by that I mean a more substantial bite opposed to a softer pasta which is often associated with all purpose flour. 

*Step 2: the dough*

Traditionally you would make a fountain, pour water in the center and mix the flour into the water with a fork, then work the dough with the  bottom of your palm on a wooden pastry board. 

I dont find the method to be the best though mainly because its quite messy and I think you can achieve an almost indistinguishable final result with a much more reasonable technique: for this reason we will start in a bowl. 

I put the flower in a bowl and make a hole in the middle, then I keep pouring water in such hole while mixing the flour into the water. 
When I see chunks of well hydrated dough I try to feel them with my fingers to see how wet they are and tear them so its easier for me to avoid lumps. 

When I feel like a big part of the flour has absorbed water and its beginning to come together I flip the bowl on a wooden board and start working the dough there. 
At this stage dont expect everything to be mixed, you will have flour that hasnt touched water at all and too well hydrated chunks at the same time, when I say the dough needs to come together It wont be looking anything like the sphere it will become, I just mean that the hydrated chunks will be able to roughly stick together.

When on the cutting board I try to roughly separate the dry flour from the hydrated dough and start kneading the hydrated bits together while progressively incorporating the remaining flour. 
You need to work the dough with the bottom of your palm for a while (it depends on the amount of flour but I would say 10-15 mins for 200 grams of flour can work) until it is smooth.
While working the dough you can stop and let it rest for 5/10 minutes, this will allow the water to redistribute throughout the volume and make it easier to work it, just never leave the dough uncovered if you fo this, it would dry out and youll need to throw it away. 

Describing the consistency of the dough is the most difficult part: it has to be compact, but elastic, pinching it and trying to lift the whole dough should lead to the it breaking it and not extending in a stringy way. 
To wrap it up I would say the dough has to be smooth, very compact, elastic enough not to tear while kneading it but not elastic enough enough to get stringy if stressed. 
If youre somewhat into bread making you shouldnt be able to fold your pasta dough without breaking it, that I would call a stringy dough. 

When the dough is formed its crucial to let it rest covered with plastic wrap for at least 30 min, this will grant you a much more stable dough which will also be easier to roll out, speaking of which&

*Step 3: the rolling*

As tedious as this may sound you are much better doing it the old fashion way. 
Patience, good will, a good wooden rolling pin and a wooden board, thats all you need. 

As for the technique to roll out the dough I suggest to roll in one direction only, usually you apply pressure on the dough when pushing the rolling pin away from you but its the same if you do it the other way around. One important thing is to rotate the dough of 1/4 each time you roll so that thickness stay consistent: this will lead to a circular roll out which might not be appropriate for every kind of pasta, but will work for every stuffed variety and many short shapes as well; for long shapes such as spaghetti, Tonnarelli fettuccine e lasagne you want to shape big rectangles instead of circles. 

Today were making maltagliati so the circular technique will work perfectly.

When rolled out to a thickness of 3 mm (thats horrible to say, you just feel the right thickness) you want to cut the dough in small lozenges, about a inch long, maybe less. 
In reality tough maltagliati translates to poorly/badly cut implying that theyre not that consistent in size, in fact such shape was originally made out the scrape of the dough used for much common shapes of pasta, so dont be a nerd about precision, just try not to have massively different cuts that would cook unevenly. 

At least you want to dust your maltagliati with durum wheat flour which, unlike AP flour, wont bond to the pasta while still avoiding it to stick to to the working surface. 

If you want you can still use a pasta machine, it wont be the same and I dont think I can give you any tip here, you just need to follow the instructions and you will be fine. 

At this point you probably forgot what you were here For, but let me remind you were making pasta with chickpeas, so you better off boiling the pasta for no longer than three minutes and finishing it off in the pan with chickpeas.

### Oil for thickening 

Start by slicing the black truffle thinly, put it in a small bowl, add whole pepper grain and cover it with evo oil. You can either let it rest for days until the truffe and pepper aromatize the oil or cover it with a plastic wrap thats microwave safe, punch some holes in it and microwave it for 30 seconds two or three times, then let it cool. 

You will have this beautiful peppery truffle oil which you will use to thicken your pasta. 

Please dont waste a good truffle for doing this, only use summer truffle which is less intense in flavor (and costs way less) to do such things, also this specific variety needs to be cooked unlike white truffle that has to be eaten raw.

Reality is this dish is super easy! Basically you just need to make a purée and a salade and youre pretty much good to go!

Im available for any question and let me know if you enjoy this recipe as I have many to share if you find them interesting! 

Sorry for the picture quality, I wasnt expecting to post it lol. Also apologies for the broken English but I wrote this on the go and Im not a native speaker :(


###Ingredients

	"" high round/rump carpaccio 
	"" soy sauce 
	"" lime 
	"" lemon 
	"" potatoes
	"" whole milk  
	"" Rome zucchini (the small ad white stripped variety, mainly ask fro something which has a mild flavour and is quite small in section as you want to eat them raw) 
	"" baby lettuce (sorrel would work much better but I couldnt find it)
	"" spring onion 
	"" zucchini flower  
	"" green pea (edamame would be better, if you can find it instead of boiling it as suggested just steam it as you usually do) 
	"" green apple (smith)
	"" radish  
	"" mint (baby mint ideally, not so strong in flavour)  
	"" sprouts 
	"" cocoa seeds  
	"" flowers (optional)
	"" flour (optional)
	"" egg (optional)
	"" salt 
	"" pepper 
	"" EVO, extra virgin olive oil
	"" moscovado/brown sugar
	"" seed oil (whichever kind you fry with) 
	"" rice vinegar 
	"" rum (optional)
	


### Pure/mashed potatoes 


Boil the potatos till fork tender, let them cool and mash them very gently when still worm, add Evo oil, whole cool milk, pepper and a tiny pinch of salt.  
Work everything gently and without applying much force until everything is well mixed and the pure gets fluffly and creamy but still solid enough to hold its shape and not fall apart. 
Load a pastry bag and keep it warm (around 30/35 celsius would be ideal but stuff doesnt need to get that scientific, just dont serve it cold) 


### Meat 


Marinate in the fridge with the soy sauce mixed with lemon juice for half an hour to 45 min 


### Vegetables 


Wash and rinse zucchini, make short noodles out off them (next best thing is a julienne cut, but noodles is much nicer). 
Season them with evo oil, pepper, zest and lime juice (few drops, sourness is not needed here as it will be found elsewhere).
At the moment you dont need to add salt as it would make them expel the liquid which is not what we want, well add salt right before serving. 
(Optional: you can keep the cut zucchini in iced water to keep them crisp and season them once well rinsed right before plating)  

At high heat and without adding any fat, roast the spring onion cut in small petals, until sugars on the surface are well caramelised. 

Boil and the cool immediately in ice the peas (so that they can keep their vivid color without Turing brown) 

Wahs and rinse baby lettuce, season it with salt (be generous this time) and evo oil.

Splice 

Mainate thinly cut radish in rise vinegar till it turns pink, youll know its ready when it looks cool (mine clearly didnt) 

If you will serve/eat this as a main course or even starter you might want to deep fry the zucchini flowers in tempura. 
On the other hand if you intend to serve this dish as a in-between course to clean the palate before what comes next it would be better to marinate the zucchini flowers in rice vinegar. 


### Plating


Place the meat in the center of the plate ad draw a puree circle around it. 
Place roughly crushed cocoa seeds on top of the puree and keep layering with zucchini and season them it with flaky salt. 
Add baby lettuce leafs, spring onion, green peas, zucchini flwoer, sliced apple and radish.
Finish the plate with baby mint, sprouts, moscovado sugar, evo oil and corse black pepper (enjoy the peppery crunch) 
If you want to go the extra mile you can spray everything with a nice rum (I love pellerossa for this kind of stuff as it has a honey flavour which I find really interesting)",3910

**INGREDIENTS**  
***Crispy Ravioli Formaggi***  
10 oz fresh cheese ravioli  
1 Tbsp olive oil  
1 pot of boiling salted water  
3 Tbsp compound herb butter  
4 oz Portobello mushrooms, cut into 1/2"" pieces  
1 oz Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated  
1 oz Pecorino-Romano, finely grated  
***Compound Herb Butter***  
1/2 c (1 stick) unsalted butter  
2 Tbsp parsley, finely chopped  
1 Tbsp sage, finely chopped  
1 clove garlic, minced  
2 tsp lemon juice  
1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper (or more to taste)  


**INSTRUCTIONS**  
***Crispy Ravioli Formaggi***  
\-Preheat the oven to broil and bring a pot of salted water to a boil.   
\-Heat an ovenproof skillet to medium heat and add 1 Tbsp of olive oil.  
\-Add the fresh cheese ravioli to the skillet and sauté for about 3 minutes until they develop some brown spots. Use tongs to turn them after about 1-½ minutes.  
\-Remove from the skillet and drop them in the pot of boiling water for about 4 minutes.  
\-Drain and set aside.   
\-Using the same skillet, bring 3 Tbsp of the compound herb butter to a nice bubble over medium heat. Pay attention to not burn the butter. Adjust heat accordingly.  
\-Add mushrooms and sauté in the butter for about 4 minutes.  
\-Add the well-drained ravioli and half of the finely grated cheese to the pan, and gently mix.  
\-Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top, place the skillet under the broiler for about 5 minutes. We like to wait until the broiler nearly burns some of the top ravioli and cheese, increasing the crispy texture and woodsy flavor.  
\-Carefully remove the skillet from the oven. Let cool a few minutes and serve. Enjoy!  
***Compound Herb Butter***  
\-Grab a stick of butter (I use unsalted butter to control the seasoning better) and let it sit out at room temperature until it has softened a bit.  
\-In a bowl, mash the softened butter with a fork.  
\-Add all your herbs and spices, and mix everything.

2021-05-27,6,"Refreshing Mint &amp; Pea Soup with Pistachios on Top","fuzzician","COOL MINT &amp; PEA SOUP RECIPE  
  
*makes enough to for a medium soup pot*  
  
**Ingredients**  
"" 1 onion or 2 banana shallots  
"" butter and/or olive oil  
"" green peas, fresh or frozen  
"" vegetable stock (powder or stock cube is just fine)  
"" fresh mint  
"" pistachios  
"" salt  
"" pepper  
  
**Directions**  
  
1. Gently sautée an onion or a couple of shallots (roughly chopped) until translucent. Use a bit of butter and/or olive oil here, whichever you prefer, and season lightly with salt.  
  
2. Add in fresh or frozen green peas (I prefer frozen for this soup), as much or as little as you like. More peas means a thicker, more flavoursome meal, so I like to be generous here.  
  
3. Pour a generous amount of vegetable stock into a pot with the onions and peas, and stir on medium heat. You want to keep the peas tasting fresh and looking vibrant, so youll only want them to simmer for 2 to 5 minutes (2 for frozen, 5 for fresh). After that, no need to keep the stove on any longer. Its blending time!  
  
4. Blitz everything up with an immersion blender. Then add in your fresh mint and blend again. As with the peas, the more you add, the more flavour youll get. Feel free to taste and adjust the quantities of peas and mint, vegetable stock, as well as salt and pepper, to your liking.  
  
5. Because this is a cold soup, youll want to give yourself enough time to chill it before serving. To garnish, top with chopped mint and pistachios, a drizzle of olive oil, and an extra sprinkle of salt (flaky sea salt is great here).  
  
  
**Note:** You could probably enjoy this soup hot too if the weather is more on the chilly side, but I find it particularly well suited for warm spring days. [For extra tips and details, click here to go to the full recipe](https://www.allo-simone.com/soups-salads/cool-pea-soup/).",1869

\--

I used shiitake, green beans, and radishes in this ramen, but you could really use any type of vegetable or protein that you like! A few ideas:

* Cremini mushrooms
* Frozen veggies like carrots or peas
* Broccoli
* Sugar snap peas
* Carrots
* Bok Choy
* Eggs
* Tofu

The shichimi togarashi is optional. If your local store doesn't have it, just omit or you can toss your radishes with a sliced jalapeno instead!

The tahini and miso work so well in this and make such a rich, creamy broth. I really, really loved it!

## Equipment

* Large pot
* Medium pot
* Colander

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon avocado oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and thinly sliced
* 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms thinly sliced
* 4 cups vegetable stock
* ¼ cup mirin  can omit or just add a touch of sugar.
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 bunch red radishes greens reserved, radishes thinly sliced into rounds
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 2 teaspoons shichimi togarashi
* 1 teaspoon black sesame seeds or use white sesame seeds
* 2 tablespoons red miso
* S cup tahini
* 2 tablespoons chili oil to taste, add as much or as little as you like
* 12 ounces fresh green beans halved
* 16 ounces fresh or frozen ramen noodles
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

## Cook the Onions:

* Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring regularly, for 5 minutes until they just begin to soften.

## Cook the Shiitake Mushrooms:

* Add the sliced shiitake mushrooms to the onions and cook for 5-6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

## Simmer the Broth:

* Add the mirin and soy sauce to the mushrooms. Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.

## Prepare the Radishes:

* Rinse the radish greens thoroughly and set aside.
* Toss the sliced radishes with sesame oil, shichimi togarashi, salt, and sesame seeds and set aside.

## Prepare the Miso:

* Combine the miso, tahini, and chili oil in a bowl and whisk until mostly smooth. Set aside.

## Cook the Noodles:

* Right before the broth finishes simmering, add the noodles to boiling water. Drain and divide the cooked noodles between four bowls.

## Finish the Ramen Broth:

* Turn the heat down to very low on the broth. Whisk in the miso mixture. Add the green beans and radish greens and allow the heat from the broth to cook the beans. Once the beans are bright green and tender-crisp, turn off the heat. Taste and season to your preferences.

# To Serve:

* Ladle the hot broth over the ramen noodles. Arrange the sliced radishes on top. Enjoy!",2652

\- 2 tsps (10ml) Chinese cooking wine

\- 2g salt

\- 1g black pepper-

 1 egg white

&amp;#x200B;

**Cooking sauce:**

\- 1.5 tbsps soy sauce

\- 1 tbsp rice wine

\- 1 tbsp rice vinegar

\- 2 tbsps brown sugar

\- 1 tbsp ketchup

\- 3 tbsp water

\- 2 tsps cornstarch

&amp;#x200B;

**Coating:**

\- 3 tbsps tapioca starch

\- 3 tbsps cornstarch

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Pat chicken thighs with paper towels to dry them. Cut them into 1 inch small cubes and let them marinate for about 15 minutes. Make the cooking sauce as described in the ingredients list.
2. Coat the chicken using a mixture of tapioca starch and cornstarch. Add half of the starch into the marinated chicken and mix them. Dip the chicken into the other half of the starch and fully coat it.
3. Deep fry the chicken twice: (1) heat up the oil to 300 ^(o)F, deep fry the chicken for 3-4 minutes using medium heat while quickly separating them to prevent sticking. Set them aside for about 5 minutes. (2) let the oil temperature go up to 400 ^(o)F, deep fry the chicken a second time for about 1 minute.
4. Remove the chicken and drain the excess oil. Bring the cooking sauce to a boil on medium heat until it's goopy like syrup.
5. Add the chicken and some sesame seeds in the pan. Keep mixing until all the chicken is coated with this delicious sweet and sour sauce. Finally decorate it with chopped scallions. Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. If you don't have rice wine, that's fine, just substitute it with water. You can also use white vinegar to substitute rice vinegar, just keep in mind that white vinegar tastes sharper and more sour than rice vinegar, so you may need to lower the amount.
2. I added the tapioca starch for the coating because it is very finely milled and very light. It will make the chicken extra crispy, you can also use rice flour for this purpose.
3. The chicken needs to be deep fried twice. The first time will fully cook the chicken and make the meat tender and juicy, the second time will make sure the chicken stay crispy even after coated with some wet sauce.",2503

\[with Fried Fish Skins and Fresh Dill\]   
  
A. Ingredients   
\-	4 slices of bacon, minced    
\-	1 whole onion, minced   
\-	½ fennel bulb, minced   
\-	2-3 ribs (4 ounces) diced celery   
\-	1 red bell pepper, diced   
\-	1 tablespoon butter  
\-	2 tablespoons flour   
\-	1 cup clam juice  
\-	1/2 cup fish stock, vegetable stock, or water   
\-	1-pound starchy russet potatoes (no substitution), diced   
\-	1 pint hot half-and-half   
\-	Salmon fillets (at least 15 ounces), skin reserved, and cut into 1-inch cubes    
\-	5-6 dashes Tabasco hot sauce (no substitution)   
\-	Salt, pepper, fresh dill.     
  
B. Method   
1. Preheat a large, heavy bottomed - preferably cast iron - Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat.     
2. Add bacon to preheated pot and fry slowly for 8-10 minutes until the fat is completely rendered but the bacon is not burnt or overly crisp.   
3. Add onion, fennel, and celery.   
4. Season vegetable slightly with a healthy pinch of salt, and sauté patiently for another 10 minutes or until vegetables are tender and onion is translucent.    
5. Add red bell pepper near the end of step 3 once vegetables are almost tender. Careful not to overcook the pepper.    
5. Increase heat slightly and add the butter.    
6. Once the butter has melted and frothed, slowly sprinkle the flour over the cooking vegetables, turning and folding in the flour to completely cover the vegetables and work out any lumps of flour. Continue adding flour in small intervals, creating a blonde roux, and cook - but do not brown - the flour for at least 5 minutes. The mixture may get quite dry at this step, depending on the amount of fat you were able to render from the bacon. If you feel the mixture is too dry, add ½ tablespoon of butter or a neutral oil like canola.    
7. Add clam juice and stock (or water) and stir the mixture up well to get a smooth, thick consistency. Always add all the clam juice, but you may reserve some of the other cooking liquid and only add as much as you need if the mixture is too dry.     
8. Add the potato, season with a healthy pinch of salt, and simmer for around 15 minutes, adding a splash of cooking liquid if the soup gets too dry.   
9. While the potatoes are cooking, heat the half-and-half to nearly scalding in a saucepan. Once the potatoes have cooked for about 15 minutes, add the hot half-and-half and combine well.   
10. While simmering, add the Tabasco and begin seasoning to taste with incremental pinches of salt. Continue simmering for another 15 minutes or until the potatoes are just tender enough to be pierced with a fork.   
11. Once the potatoes are just tender, and the soup is well seasoned, add the salmon and cook for about 3 minutes, then turn off the heat. Allow salmon to cook in the hot soup until it just begins to flake, then finish with chopped fresh dill and fried fish skins.    
12. For the skins -- use a frying pan with 2-3 tablespoons of oil set over high heat. Season skins whole with a little salt on both sides and let them sit at room temperature for at least 10 minutes. Pat skins completely dry with a paper towel and fry in the hot oil until brown and crisp. This step can be done while the potatoes are finishing.",3273

2021-05-21,12,"Homemade Waffle Chips Crisscut Potato Chips","kindlythankful","\^\_\^ Thanks for asking! Not long at all maybe around 30seconds to a minute. If the potato is still very wet, I would use a fresh set of paper towels to try to absorb as much moisture as possible. Mainly to avoid oil splatter during the frying process. You can also use a pasta scoop strainer/wire mesh skimmer/sifters with a handle to gently deploy the waffle chips into the oil. Another variable to consider is the thickness of your waffle fries. Mine was pretty thin so 275°F will do just fine. For thicker waffle fries you might want to consider using 350°F - 375°F for oil temperature. Double frying the thicker waffle fries at a higher temperature can also improve the crispy texture on the outside. Hope this is helpful!",728

**Method:**

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. First,  prep the king trumpet mushrooms. Use a fork to shred down the entire length of the mushroom. Make several long shreds down the mushroom until you're able to pull it apart. Shred the mushroom with your fingers. You can break the cap into small pieces.
3. Arrange the shredded trumpet and sliced shiitake mushroom caps on a baking sheet. Toss with the oil, salt, pepper, cumin, and chili powder. Transfer to the oven and roast for 20-25 minutes. If desired, melt butter into the mushrooms and toss to coat. Turn off the oven and leave the mushrooms in the warm oven.
4. Make the slaw: Combine the sliced Brussels sprouts, minced red onion, cilantro, and jalapeño in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
5. In a small bowl mix together the mayo, lime juice, maple syrup, chili powder, oil until smooth. Add a splash or two of water to thin it out. It should be smooth but not too thin.
6. Pour the dressing over the Brussels sprouts and toss to coat. Set aside.
7. In a small pot, heat a touch more avocado oil over medium heat. Add the remaining sliced onion to the pot and cook for 5 minutes.
8. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute.
9. Add the green chili peppers and the black beans. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Taste and season again before serving.
10. Warm the tortillas in a dry skillet for 30-45 seconds per side.
11. Arrange the tortillas on plates and add a spoonful of beans to each tortilla. Pile the mushrooms on top and garnish with the slaw. Serve with more limes and a few cilantro leaves, if you like. Enjoy!",2799

2021-05-18,29,"Soft Sugar Cake Cookies with Raspberry Frosting","cookingsheri","These ""cookies"" are made with cake flour and taste and feel like the top of a cupcake! Aesthetically pleasing AND delicious! Used Eric Kim's Recipe from NYT with tweaks to the frosting part.  
INGREDIENTS  
FOR THE COOKIES:  


* ½ cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature
* 3 ounces/85 grams cream cheese, at room temperature
* 1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 2 ¼ cups/285 grams cake flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* Sprinkles, for garnish

FOR THE FROSTING:  


* 4 tbsp seedless raspberry jam
* ½ cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature
* 1 cups/130 grams confectioners sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Pinch of kosher salt

PREPARATION  
Make the cookies:

1. In a large bowl, mix together the butter, cream cheese, sugar and salt until smooth and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla extract, and whisk to incorporate some air and to dissolve the sugar crystals, about 1 minute.
2. Stir in the flour and baking powder until just incorporated.
3. Heat oven to 350 degrees and line two rimmed sheet pans with parchment paper. Using two spoons or a cookie scooper, plop out 2-tablespoon/50-gram rounds spaced a couple of inches apart. (You should get about 7 to 8 cookies per sheet pan.) Place the sheet pans in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes until the dough is no longer sticky and easier to handle.
4. While the dough chills, make the frosting:In a bowl, add butter, confectioners sugar, vanilla extract, raspberry jam and salt and, with an electric hand mixer, mix until the butter absorbs the sugar and gets fluffy. Cover and set aside.
5. Remove the sheet pans from the freezer. Roll the chilled dough into even balls and flatten them slightly with your fingers so theyre about 2 inches wide and 1 inch high. Bake the cookies for 13 to 15 minutes, rotating the pans and switching racks halfway through, or until they no longer look wet on top, are still light in color and spring back to the touch. They will puff up and crack slightly. Let cool completely on the sheet pan. (They will continue to cook as they sit.)
6. Using a butter knife or offset spatula, frost each cooled cookie with the raspberry frosting and adorn with the sprinkles

2021-05-18,3,"Homemade Boba from Scratch - Bubble Tea Recipe","cookingwithRobin","Bubble tea is a tea based drink that commonly consists of hot tea and milk accompanied by chewy tapioca pearls, also known as boba. There are many varieties of bubble tea, but the original and most popular one is black tea and milk with black sugar tapioca pearls at the bottom. The tapioca pearls are perfectly chewy and bouncy, and the black sugar gives you a deep rich taste without being overly sweet!

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/MCrLUZoQUjI)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

Boba (\~ 180 Tapioca pearls):

\- 90g black sugar

\- 100ml water

\- 160g tapioca starch

&amp;#x200B;

Milk tea:

\- 15g loose black tea leaves

\- 100ml water

\- 400ml milk

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Let's make the boba first. Dissolve the black sugar in the water and bring them to a rolling boil. Turn off the heat and add 3 tbsps of tapioca starch into the black sugar mixture to gelatinize the starch.
2. Add the rest of tapioca starch and keep mixing until it roughly forms a dough. (At this time, the dough will be very lumpy.) Knead the dough until it is smooth.
3. Cut a strip out of the dough, roll it out into a skinny strand, then cut it into small pieces. Boba is usually around 1cm in diameter. (However, since this is your homemade boba, you can make them any size you want! They will also expand after boiling)
4. Roll each piece into a ball shape. Set them aside in a container that's lightly dusted by tapioca starch so that the boba will not stick together.
5. Boil the boba in the boiling water for about 15 minutes, turn off the heat and let them sit for another 10 minutes.
6. Drain the boba. To prevent them from sticking, add 1 tbsp of black sugar and half a tbsp of water and mix them.
7. To make the milk tea, you can use either tea bags or loose tea leaves, and it's your choice if you want to make it taste heavier on the tea flavor or the milk flavor. Here I used 15g of loose black tea leaves, 100ml water and 400ml milk.
8. To assemble the boba milk tea, add some boba at the bottom, add ice cubes and pour the milk tea in. Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. Black sugar is basically unrefined cane sugar. Most commercial brown sugar is either fully or partially refined cane sugar with molasses added back in. This is what makes it brown. The main difference between black and brown sugar is that black sugar has even more molasses since it's completely unrefined. Because of this, black sugar has a richer taste and a deeper color. It also has a lot more health benefits than other types of sugar, and is not very sweet.
2. How to store the tapioca pearls: Seal them in a ziploc bag and leave it at room temperature. You can store them for months in this way :)",2752

For the Dough:

\- 2 Cups All Purpose Flour

\- 1/2 Cup Hot Water

\- 1/3 Cup Room-Temp Water

For the Lamination Paste:

\- 1/2 Cup All Purpose Flour

\- 1/4 Cup untoasted Sesame Oil

\- 1/4 Cup Neutral Oil

\- 1 tsp Onion Powder

\- 1 tbsp Chinese 5 Spice

\- 2 tsp Salt

\- 1 Cup Spring Onion (Chopped)

For the Sauce:

\- 1 tsp Hoisin Sauce

\- 1 tsp Soy Sauce

\- 2 tsp Chili Oil

Recipe:

\- Combine the ingredients for the dough, and mix well

\- Knead the dough until smooth and sticky. Rest for at least 30 minutes, the longer the better, I kept mine in the fridge for 20 hours.

\- Heat up the Sesame Oil &amp; the Neutral oil, while combining the other ingredients for the lamination paste in a bowl

\- Pour over heated oil over the ingredients, mix well

\- Divide the rested dough into 3

\- Roll out the dough into a very thin layer, and spread the lamination paste

\- Roll into a jelly roll structure and twist inwards from one end, and outwards from the other. Put one end on top of another and squish.

\- Roll out until flat, and fry over low heat with a good amount of oil to cover the whole surface.

\- Flip once golden and crispy

\- Serve with the Sauce and enjoy

Notes:

\- The dough gets better the longer you rest it, I rested mine for 20 hours and the result was great! In a pinch, however, a 30 min rest would do just fine too! I have made both versions before and they are both good!

\- The lamination paste works exactly how it does in a croissant, just in an instant way. It helps to keep the layers separate. I tried just using plain oil and scallions, however the paste really makes a huge difference. Each layers becomes more distinguishable.

# Ingredients:

* 1 cup chickpeas
* 1 medium onion
* 3 cloves garlic
* 5 tablespoons fresh parsley
* 1 tablespoon Coriander
* 0.5 tablespoon caraway powder
* 0.5 tablespoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 5 tablespoons cooking oil

# Steps:

1. Soak the chickpeas in water for at least 12 hours and drain them. Peel and chop the onions.
2. Put all the ingredients (except oil) in a blender or meat grinder to be mixed. the better you mince everything the softer your falafel would be.
3. Make falafel balls with your hands or use a scoop to help you shape them better.
4. pour enough oil in a pan and wait until it's hot, then fry the falafels in the pan.
5. Turn the falafels so the other side is cooked as well.
6. Now you can make your falafel sandwich and enjoy it. You can also have it with some fresh greens and vegetables.

# Tips and tricks

1. You should soak the chickpeas in water for at least 12 to 24 hours before you start cooking.
2. Onions prevent falafels from turning too dry, but if you use too much onion your falafels would probably lose their shape. You should use about 170 grams of onion,
3. The chickpeas must be totally minced and crushed. The more even you make your dough, the softer your falafel will become.
4. If your falafel dough is losing its shape, you should add one or two tablespoons of flour to your mixture, but it is better to use the right amount of the ingredients to prevent adding extra flour.
5. You need a large amount of oil to have the best-looking falafels. I wrote the approximate amount of absorbed oil in the ingredients section for you to be able to count the calories.",1760

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Melt butter over medium-low, add barberries and sugar, fry for 2-3 minutes and set aside. Make sure not to burn the barberries
2. Grind saffron: we used a mortar and pestle. A pinch of salt helps with grinding. Add 2 tablespoons of water, mix and let cool down
3. In big enough bowl, mix yogurt, salt, oil, egg-yolks and saffron 
4. Wash rice under lukewarm water, rinse till the starch is fully washed of and the water not blurry anymore. Let drain
5. Boil 6 cups / 1.5 liter of water, salt it generously to make it salty as the sea
6. Add rice and boil for 6-8 minutes, till it's soft on the outside, but still firm inside. Usually the first rice kernels start floating, when this is the case
7. Rinse rice over cold water, this helps to prevent the rice from sticking to each other, and drain
8. Mix into the bowl with yogurt mix. Gently, don't break the rice kernels
9. Pre-heat the oven to 410°F/210°C 
10. Transfer half of the rice-yogurt mix into an oven-safe form, and sprinkle half of the barberries over
11. Cover with remaining rice and gently press with a spatula to an even form, with no excess space between rice and form, to make it as crispy as possible
12. Cover the top of the form with kitchen foil and bake on mid-low level for 55-90 minutes. In our electric oven it took almost 90 minutes to get the outside nicely golden, but monitor the process, your oven might differ
13. Take out of oven, take the foil off (otherwise the steam will soften your crispy rice) and let cool for a few minutes

Gently poached chicken that is dressed in a sweet soy sauce and served with a side of tangy, spicy hot sauce. The rice is to die for! Jasmine rice is cooked with the chicken poaching liquid, chicken fat, pandan leaves, garlic, and shallots.

You'll ask for 2nds and 3rds of just the rice alone! Here is the [step-by-step video tutorial](https://youtu.be/nb7I1zwyX9M)

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients - 4-5 Servings

* 3 - 4 lb Whole Chicken
* 4 Spring Onions
* 1"" Knob Ginger
* Unsalted Chicken Stock or Water (I highly recommend you use pre-made chicken stock!)\*Enough to cover the chicken. It's ok if the chicken isn't fully submerged. The steam will cook the chicken breasts.
* 20g Kosher Salt per Liter of Chicken Stock/Water + 1/2 tsp msg per Liter if using water.

&amp;#x200B;

* BRINE:
* 1/3 Cup Kosher Salt
* Water to Rinse
* Boiling Water to tighten the skin

&amp;#x200B;

* RICE:
* 3 Cups Jasmine Rice
* 4 TBSP Chicken Fat
* 8 Garlic Cloves (bashed)
* 2 Large Shallots (roughly chopped)
* 1/2"" Knob Ginger (thick slices)
* 3 Cups + 6 TBSP Chicken Broth (from cooking chicken) \*1 cup + 2 tbsp for every 1 cup of rice
* A bundle of Pandan Leaves

&amp;#x200B;

* SOY DRESSING:
* 1/4 Cup Light Soy Sauce
* 2 TSP Sesame Oil
* 1 TBSP Rendered Chicken Fat
* 1 TSP Sugar

&amp;#x200B;

* CHILI SAUCE:
* 6 Red Chilies (de-seeded) \*Control the spice level by leaving in the seeds or adding a few bird's eye chilis (3:2 ratio)
* 1"" Knob of Ginger
* 8 Garlic Cloves
* 1 TSP White Vinegar
* 3 TBSP Tangerine Juice (1 tangerine)
* Pinch of Kosher Salt
* 2 TBSP Chicken Broth (from cooking chicken)
* 1 TSP Sugar

&amp;#x200B;

Instructions

1. Rub the chicken with kosher salt until the skin is smooth and slippery.
2. Rinse the salt off with water.
3. Cut off any chicken fat located around the butt &amp; neck areas. Set aside for the rice and soy dressing.
4. If you're not using a giant pot to cook the chicken, boil a kettle of water and slowly pour it all over the chicken and into the cavity.
5. This process will tighten the chicken skin and will help us create that gelatinized skin we all love in Hainanese chicken.
6. Stuff the chicken cavity with a bunch of spring onions and ginger.
7. If you're using a big pot, you can simply bring the pot of chicken stock/water to a boil and dip the chicken in a few times before fully submerging.
8. I used a pot that was just big enough to fit a 3.5lb chicken which only required \~3 cups of liquid.
9. Make sure the liquid is boiling before you fully submerge the chicken.
10. Cover the pot with a lid, bring it back up to a boil, turn the heat down to a bare simmer, and cook for 30-35 minutes.
11. A 3-3.5 lb chicken will take 30-35 minutes, 3.5-4.5 lb chicken \~35-40 minutes.
12. Prepare an ice bath.
13. To see if the chicken is done cooking, cut into the thickest part of the thigh.
14. If the juices run clear, the chicken is ready. If there is still blood, it'll need a few more minutes.
15. Submerge the cooked chicken into an ice bath for at least 15 minutes, rotating every few minutes if it's not fully submerged.
16. This will stop the cooking process and is the final step to creating the gelatinized chicken skin!
17. Drain on a wire rack and lightly brush on some sesame oil.
18. Serve at room temperature. You can reheat it for 1-2 minutes but run the risk of drying out the meat.
19. Wash and drain the Jasmine rice.
20. Render out the 4 tbsp of chicken fat until the solids become nice and crispy.
21. If you don't have enough chicken fat, add some sesame oil and vegetable oil.
22. Pan-fry the ginger, garlic, and shallots until fragrant. 1-2 minutes.
23. Some recipes call for pan-frying the rice too but it's not necessary if you thoroughly mix the rice later.
24. Add 3 Cups + 6 TBSP of the chicken broth to the rice. We're using the chicken broth we cooked the chicken in!
25. The broth should be seasoned enough that you don't need to add any more salt to the rice.
26. Add the aromatics &amp; oils to the rice and mix thoroughly.
27. Add a bundle of pandan leaves.
28. Cook according to rice cooker instructions.
29. Remove all the aromatics and give the rice a mix to fluff it up. Keep warm.
30. Blend all the chili sauce ingredients together until smooth. Set aside.
31. Calamansi is normally used instead of tangerine juice but it's not commonly found here in the states.
32. Combine the soy dressing ingredients. Set aside.
33. Remove the wings and thighs from the chicken.
34. Chop off the back and carefully remove the breast bones.
35. Chop into bite-sized pieces.
36. Serve on top of a bed of cucumbers.
37. Spoon on some soy dressing.
38. Garnish with spring onions.
39. Serve with a bowl of chicken rice and a side of chili sauce.",4767

2021-05-16,38,"Sweet &amp; Salty Bars","yellowjacquet","I have seen these bars go by a few different names but growing up we always called them Sweet &amp; Salty Bars. They were one of my absolute favorite desserts as a kid and I would get so excited when my grandmother would prepare them for me! I think they may even be the first dessert I ever learned how to make. They are ALWAYS a hit wherever I take them and friends who have tried them beg me to make them again.

# Ingredients

* 40 to 50 saltine crackers
* 8 tbsp margarine (1 stick), see note
* 8 tbsp butter (1 stick), see note
* 1 cup light brown sugar
* 1 package dark or semi-sweet chocolate chips (10-12 oz)
* Flakey sea salt or slivered nuts (optional, for topping)

# Notes

* If made with two sticks of butter the bars will turn out brittle like toffee. If made with two sticks of margarine the bars will be VERY gooey, even straight from the freezer. ½ margarine &amp; ½ butter results in a texture I strongly prefer over either on its own.

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425° F.
2. Line a large Jelly Roll pan with aluminum foil, spray with nonstick spray and arrange the saltines salt-side down in a single layer. Break some crackers into smaller pieces to fill in the edges as needed
3. Melt together the butter and margarine in a saucepan over medium heat. Once melted add the brown sugar. Cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture is bubbling all over and turns a caramel color. Allow the mixture to boil for about a minute, then remove from heat (be careful to ensure it doesnt boil over).
4. Mix well then pour the mixture over the crackers, covering them as evenly as possible. Put the jelly-roll pan into the oven and bake until the mixture begins to bubble, about 3 minutes. Very carefully remove the pan from the oven, taking care to keep it level (it can easily spill).
5. Set the pan down on a heat proof flat surface. Use a butter knife or spatula to re-level any overlapping crackers back into a single layer. Once the mixture has stopped bubbling scatter the chocolate chips evenly over the top. The chips will take a few minutes to melt completely (they may appear too sparse at first but dont worry, it always looks this way). Spread them as they melt to form an even layer of chocolate on top.
6. Optionally, top with flakey sea salt or slivered nuts.
7. Transfer the pan to the freezer or fridge and chill until completely cooled (I use the freezer). Once fully chilled, remove from the freezer and peel off the aluminum foil. Break the bars up into pieces (its okay if the size varies piece to piece). This step can be a bit messy, especially if the bars are not fully cooled.
8. Store in an airtight container between layers of wax paper in the fridge or freezer. They stay fresh for about a week in the fridge or a few months in the freezer.

I could only post one pic here but theres more photos and progress pics on my Instagram: [@CraftyCookbook](https://instagram.com/craftycookbook?igshid=et7z4gbq8uva)

Edit to say you can eat these basically straight out of the freezer (I usually let them sit for ~3 mins first) so its a great thing to make if you live alone or want a dessert that lasts awhile!",3159
2021-05-16,2,"Charred Endives with Cheese, Beetroot and Mint","AlvaroMenduina","**Charred Endives with Cheese, Beetroot and Mint** \[RECIPE\]

Delicious, warm salad style recipe that is so quick and easy to make. In my opinion, endives (chicory) are a bit underrated, but with this recipe, they really shine and become the star of the show. Beautifully browned and charred around the edges, with dollops of melted cheese, and the freshness of the mint and beetroot. Definitely worth a try.

If you like this recipe, feel free to check my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/food_with_alvaro/?hl=en). Let me know what's your favourite underrated vegetable!

*Ingredients* \[2 people\]

* 2 endives / chicory
* grated cooked beetroot (to taste, around 50 g)
* 50 - 75 g of creamy cheese (brie or Camembert style)
* seed mix (I'm using one that has sesame, sunflower, and pumpkin)
* mint leaves
* butter
* olive oil
* salt and pepper

*Recipe*

1. In a dry pan over high heat, toast the seeds for 2-3 minutes. Reserve for garnish
2. Meanwhile, slice the endives in quarters. Make sure NOT to remove the core, as it will keep the leaves together during cooking. 
3. Add 1 tablespoon of butter with some olive oil to the pan. Place the endive quarters in the pan, cut side down. Cut on high heat until brown and charred. This should take 3-4 minutes.
4. Take the endives out and place some dollops of creamy cheese on top. The residual heat of the endives will help the cheese melt. Add the beetroot, mint leaves and toasted seeds. Season to taste. Enjoy!",1472

1. Preheat the oven to 150°c. Prepare cake molds to spread butter or place baking paper on the mold for later use.
2. After the butter is melted, add milk and mix well.
3. Separate the yolks and whites of the eggs, and put the yolks in a bowl of butter. Put the egg whites into a large bowl that is free of oil and water.
4. Stir the egg yolks evenly.
5. Add sifted plain flour, corn flour, and milk powder to the egg yolk bowl, and mix until there is no dry powder.
6. Add a few drops of lemon juice or white vinegar to the egg whites.
7. Use a whisk at high speed until the egg whites appear coarsely foamed, add 1/3 fine sugar, and continue to beat at high speed.
8. After the bubbles become thinner, add 1/3 fine sugar, and then continue to beat at high speed.
9. After the bubbles are finer, add the remaining fine sugar, and continue to beat until hard foaming.
10. Scoop 1/3 of the meringue into the egg yolk batter and mix well.
11. Pour the mixed egg yolk batter into the meringue in batches and mix evenly.
12. Pour evenly mixed batter into the mold, tap it a few times to knock out the coarse air bubbles.
13. Put it in the preheated oven. Bake at 150°c for 60 minutes.
14. After baking, remove the mold and let it cool, and then use a 6-inch mold to measure the part to cut off.
15. Gently stuff the cake into the bottom of the mold.

#####Mango Jelly Layer
1. After peeling the mango, keep the most flesh part first, and then we will use it to make roses.
2. Cut the remaining part into the blender, add water to make a smoothie.
3. Filter it to make it smoother.
4. First mix the sugar, Konnyaku jelly powder, and agar-agar powder in a dry pan.

6. Turn off the heat after boiling, pour in the mango smoothie and mix well.
7. Filter again into the mold.
8. After pouring, scoop out the small bubbles floating on the surface.
9. When you are satisfied with the surface, you can put it into a container or wrap it with clingfilm, and put it in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or until it solidifies.

#####Mango Rose
1. Cut the mango flesh we just reserved into slices about 3mm thick.
2. Start with small slices of mango, starting from the center, and then one by one around each other to form a flower shape.
3. Finally, use a small piece rolled into a flower core and stuff it into the center gap, thus completing a mango rose.

#####Crystal Jelly Layer
1. First mix the sugar, Konnyaku jelly powder and agar-agar powder in a dry pan.
2. Add water and stir evenly to ensure that there are no lumps before turning on the fire. Stirring over medium heat.
3. Turn off the heat after boiling, and slowly filter the spoonful into the mold. Try to pour gently and close to the rose to avoid creating more bubbles.
4. Bubbles can be scooped up or use a fire gun to defoam.
5. Leave it for about 5 minutes to 10 minutes, there will be bubbles occasionally pop up, then pick it up or puncture it with a needle.
6. Wait for the jelly to cool down before putting it into the container. If you use cling film, let it cool and wrap it up after the surface has solidified, and put it in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or until it solidifies.
7. Use a plastic knife to cut along the edge, and then use a taller cup to push up the bottom of the movable mold. Then cut into the size you like and enjoy!",4343
2021-05-15,2,"An easy Japanese rice dish made in a rice cooker or on the stovetop -- just 30 minutes.","madebyyouandi","This was a staple in university because I had no time to cook and no stomach for junk food. I would put everything in the rice cooker and have something warm to eat ready all day long.



Here is a video so that you can easily understand:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9UCXQcRQdU



There are a couple of hacks here. One, mirin is just sake with extra sugar and the sake is used to minimize odors. If you don't have mirin for your Japanese recipes, either:

Sake + 1 teaspoon sugar

or

Water + teaspoon sugar (but this won't mask any smells, usually from meats)

One recipe done in a slightly different order gives you two of Japan's easiest rice dishes, this one is called TAKIKOMI.

&amp;#x200B;

2 cups Rice

Shiitake Mushrooms (4 or 5)

Seasonal Mushrooms (1/2 - 1 cup)

1 Carrot

1/2 cup sliced Burdock Root (Gobo -- any seasonal vegetable)

1 pack Konkyaku (has no flavor, adds texture, can omit)

2 fried tofu (abura age) (adds texture and protein, can omit)

200 grams Chicken (preferably leg meat)

2 tablespoons Soy Sauce

2 tablespoons Mirin (or 1 teaspoon sugar, 2 tablespoons sake)2 tablespoons Sake (this is said to negate any odor)

Salt to taste

2 cups Dashi

(note: the amount of vegetables and chicken is not precisely measured but ratio of rice to dashi is always 1 cup rice to 1 cup dashi.)

1. Wash the rice and set aside. Doing this will partly hydrate the rice which is said to improve the texture and flavor.

2.	Slice the vegetables and set aside. (note: some people put the sliced burdock in water to remove bitterness and/or prevent oxidation)

3.	Boil the konyaku and 'fried tofu' separately. Drain, slice, and set aside.

4.	Slice the chicken, with skin, into bite sized pieces and add the soy sauce, mirin, and sake. 

5.	Prepare your dashi.

6.	Now that all of your ingredients are ready, combine them either in a rice cooker or a deep sauce pan. 

7.	The rice MUST go into the pan first. Make sure it is evenly spread along the bottom.

8.	Place the rest of the ingredients into the pot in any order but do not mix.

9.	Add the dashi. 

10.	Set into your rice cooker. (Japanese rice cookers will have a special setting labeled M¼.)

11.	If you are using a stovetop, without stirring the pot, bring it to a boil then cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 13 minutes, then turn off the heat. Do not open the pot. Let it steam for an additional 15 minutes.

12.	Stir the takikomi rice and serve.

I've had good success with even the most wet recipes this way, just with a longer cooking time. Keep an eye on it, and as my mom says, "" The nose knows when its done!""

2 large Chicken Breasts

2 Yellow Onions

2 Portobello Mushroom Cups or 6oz of any Mushroom

5 Cloves of Garlic

9oz of Fresh Mozzarella cheese

4 slices of Prosciutto ham

1 cup of Heavy Cream

1/2 cup of White Wine (optional)

Fresh Thyme

[full recipe with pictures here](https://tasteabroad.com/recipe/chicken-roulade-with-mushrooms-in-creamy-sauce/)

1. Prepare chicken breast

Paper dry chicken breast and slice horizontally from the thicker side to a thinner, but stop about 1/2 inches to it. This way you will ""butterfly"" your chicken breast, which is a well-known technique to make thin and large chicken pieces. 

Cover your butterflied chicken breast with a piece of plastic wrap and roll a pin over it to make it even and thinner. Set aside.

2.  Make mushroom stuffing 

Mince 5 cloves of garlic and sauté it in a frying pan over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add finely chopped 2 onions, keep sautéing for another 2 minutes. Add chopped Portobello mushroom caps to the pan and keep cooking stirring occasionally for 5 more minutes or until all water will evaporate from the pan. 

Add a quarter of a cup of dry White Wine, mix well and cook until stuffing gets almost dry. 

At that point add 1 teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, and some fresh minced thyme. Mix well and set aside to cool down.

3. Roll!

Place your chicken with a wide side down and thin side up like on the pictures below. 
Divide mushroom sauce into 3 parts: 2 for each chicken breast and 1 for the cream sauce for later. 

Using a spoon, evenly spread 1 part of mushroom stuffing over the chicken piece, leaving half an inch on each side uncovered. 

Next, lay some thinly sliced fresh mozzarella, keep sides uncovered.

Gently roll chicken working your way from the wider bottom to the thinner top. Do not add too much pressure, as your stuffing will try to escape! We will secure everything in place with a cooking twine in just a second.

Now it is time to wrap our roulade in prosciutto. Here is what I learned the hard way ( meaning one of the roulades on final pictures is an unsuccessful test, but still the same delicious ha!): lay prosciutto slices parallel to your chicken roll, this way it is much easier to cover the whole roulade, which will look so much better when the dish is done!

Twine up! Using a cooking twine (the cotton string will work just fine!) gently wrap your roulade, starting from one side of it with tying a knot and work your way to the other side. Now you can add some pressure to help twine keep roulade`s shape while searing it. 

4. Sear roulade 

Preheat your skillet pan on medium heat. I used skillet mostly because I  wanted to be able to cook my dish both on a stovetop and in the oven, so if you have a suitable frying pan you can stick it into your cooking stove, - use that! Also, I used 2 tablespoons of canola oil to season my pan. 

Add your chicken roulades into a hot pan and sear for 3 minutes on each of 4 sides.  Let it cool down for 5 minutes before proceeding to the final step.

5. Sauce and bake

Gently remove twine by cutting each layer and pulling it.

Finally, pour half a cup of heavy cream into your pan, add a third of the mushroom stuffing left from making roulades, and a little bit more cheese ( at this point you can use any cheese you love but make sure it is great melting one). 

Place pan into the preheated to 370F oven and bake for 20 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for the nonstop whisking is you're creating a butter emulsification to poach the lobster in. The amount of butter you'll need will vary depending on the amount of lobster you have and the size of your pot. You want the lobster to be fully submerged! 

&amp;#x200B;

The cook time will vary on the size of your lobster tail, so about 5-8 minutes is a safe bet. You don't want to overcook it! 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

FOR THE SAUCE

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Start off with 3 tablespoons of butter on medium low temperature to melt it, add 3 cloves of smashed garlic, let that cook for a few minutes to get that butter all garlicy and junk, add the fresh oregano and parsley and about a cup of the pasta water, bring that to a simmer, add a half a cup of fresh grated parmesan, getting it all melty and delicious, after that's all melted, add 3/4 a cup of cream, bring that to a simmer, add desired amount of pasta to pan, get it all stirred up and junk and let it all get to know each other over medium low heat for about 10 minutes until the sauce thickens up to your desired consistency!

You can find it in a lot of Asian markets, however, the homemade red bean paste is much fresher, tastier, healthier and more flavorful than the store bought ones.   

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/ozSzTWWXfh8)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:** 

\- 150g red beans 

\- 400ml water 

\- 50g sugar (adjust as necessary, this recipe is not too sweet) 

\- 1g salt 

\- 2 tbsps vegetable oil 

\- 2 tbsps maltose or honey (optional)

\- Puff pastry 

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Clean the red beans, add water, and cook it using an instant pot with a bean option. This will usually takes about 40 minutes. (If you don't have an instant pot or a pressure cooker, you'll need to soak the red beans overnight and boil them for about 1.5-2 hours until the beans are soft and fully cooked.)
2. Strain the red beans. Put them in a blender with about 50 grams of sugar and blend them into a smooth paste. (Adjust the amount of sugar as necessary, this recipe is not too sweet.)
3. Use low to medium heat, transfer the red bean paste into a non-stick pan. Add 2 tbsps of oil, a pinch of salt (\~1g), and 2 tbsps of maltose or honey (optional). Mix them well. (Both maltose and honey are sticky which helps make the red bean paste smoother, but this is optional as the oil functions similarly). 
4. After cooking the red bean paste for about 10 min, the texture will be very smooth and not wet. Form the red bean paste into small balls, each one weighing about 25 grams.
5. Defrost the store bought puff pastry at room temperature for about 30 min. Cut it into 14 pie dough (3 inches in diameter). Use a rolling pin to thin out the edge. Dough should be thick in the center and thin on the edge. 
6. Put one red bean ball in each dough. Pinch the edge together and make sure to seal it completely. Put the seam side down.
7. How to make the flower-shaped pastry: following step 6, press down the dough gently and make it into a pancake shape. Cut it into five parts clockwise but leave the center connected. Gently score each part in the middle, then pinch the end together to make the flower shape.
8. Brush on a thin layer of the egg wash. Decorate with a pinch of sesame seeds on top.
9. Bake at 375°F for 25 minutes.",2340

* 1 cup sugar
* 4 tablespoon butter
* 100 grams heavy cream
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

# Instructions

1. Heat (medium heat) sugar once it starts melting. Pay attention to move the pan once in a time.
2. Sugar should be heated until it is caramelized.
3. Then add butter and stir it until it melts.
4. Add cream and stir it well. In the first place it becomes thick, but stir it during the heating until it becomes smooth.
5. After removing it from heating, add vanilla and salt, then stir.

## Tips and tricks

* Adding salt is optional, but personally, for having the incredible flavor of the caramel and preventing the extensive flavor of sweetness, it is great to use salt.
* pay attention that the sugar not get burned. If it burns, the only flavor you taste is a burning caramel.",982

* Mash 3 of the bananas in a large mixing bowl with the cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and salt. Whisk in the brown sugar and eggs until well combined, then stir in the milk.
* Add the bread cubes to a separate large mixing bowl, and pour the prepared milk mixture over top. Use a spatula to fold the mixture to combine everything evenly. Let the bread soak for 2-3 minutes, then pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish.
* Spread the bread cubes evenly, corner to corner, in the baking dish. Slice the remaining banana and arrange over the top. Bake for 40-50 minutes, until the bread pudding is golden brown and fully set. Serve with whipped cream and caramel sauce.

### Notes

\*Its important that the bread cubes are completely dry, or stale, so the bread pudding doesnt come out mushy. To stale your bread, you have two options:

1. Cube the bread and leave it in a single layer on a large baking sheet overnight.
2. Cube the bread and bake at 250F for 30-35 minutes, until dry.

\*\*Easy homemade caramel sauce:

1. Melt 6 tbsp unsalted butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add 1 cup of brown sugar to the pan and whisk well to combine.
2. Bring the mixture to a bubble and whisk often for about 5 minutes, until the brown sugar has mostly dissolved.
3. Turn the heat down to low and add 1/2 cup heavy cream. Continue to whisk until the mixture is completely smooth.
4. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in 2 tsp of vanilla and 1/4  1/2 tsp salt, depending on your preference. Pour the sauce into a heat-proof jar or container and let it cool down at room temperature for 15-20 minutes before serving.",2177

2021-05-07,54,"Pepperoni Roll / Pepperoni Bread","pangibear","# Pepperoni Roll / Pepperoni Bread

This recipe makes enough dough for 2 loaves of pepperoni bread (youll have to double the fillings though). So, my recommendation is to either double the fillings or save the other half of the dough to make a homemade pizza!

For full recipe, tips, tricks, &amp; other filling ideas, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/pepperoni-roll-pepperoni-bread/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/pepperoni-roll-pepperoni-bread/)

### INGREDIENTS 

#### Pizza Dough (makes 2)

* 1-1/4 c warm water
* 1 tsp granulated sugar
* 2 tsp instant yeast
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 3-1/2 c flour
* 1-1/4 tsp salt

#### Fillings (makes 1)

* 5 oz pepperoni, sliced thin
* 1 lb mozzarella cheese, grated or cut into thin strips
* 1/4 c Parmesan cheese, grated
* 1 large egg, beaten
* 2 Tbsp butter, melted
* Your favorite Italian spices and herbs (garlic powder, oregano, basil, etc)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* In a stand mixer bowl, using a spoon, stir together warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit for five minutes or until it becomes frothy. Then, add olive oil and stir again.
* In a separate bowl, mix together flour and salt. 
* Using the dough hook attachment, turn your stand mixer on to a low-medium speed (about 3 or 4). Slowly add the flour mixture while the dough hook is turning. Mix until dough pulls away from sides of the bowl, about two minutes.
* Form dough into a ball. Grease a large bowl with olive oil, place the dough ball in the bowl, and turn it over and over so that all sides of the dough are oiled. Cover with a towel and place in a warm spot for about one hour, until dough has doubled in size.
* Preheat oven to 375°. 
* Cut dough in half. Wrap half tightly in plastic wrap and store in the fridge for up to two days.
* Roll out the other half of the dough until it measures approx 163 x 123, give or take.
* Brush the surface of the rolled out dough with beaten egg. 
* Next, cover the surface of the dough with pepperoni, then mozzarella, then Parmesan.
* Starting on a long side, roll up the dough (fairly tightly), and pinch the ends under.
* Place your formed pepperoni bread on a baking sheet, seam-side down.
* Mix Italian herbs and spices (like garlic powder, oregano, basil, etc) into melted butter and brush over the top of the pepperoni bread.
* Bake for 35-40 minutes or until dough is lightly browned. Slice and serve hot, warm, room temperature, or right from the fridge. If you want to take it another step, heat up some spaghetti sauce or pizza sauce for dipping!
* Store in a resealable plastic bag on the countertop for several days, in the fridge for up to five days, or in the freezer for up to a month. To reheat, microwave each slice for about 30 seconds. Enjoy!",2720

#### Poached rhubarb:

* 200g forced rhubarb, chopped into 2 inch (5cm) batons
* 20g (2 tablespoons) granulated sugar
* 20ml (1½ tablespoons) orange juice
* Zest from ½ an orange
* 1 star anise
* Grated ginger from 1 inch fresh ginger / ½ teaspoon ground ginger

#### Custard:

* 250g (1 cup + 1½ tablespoons) whole milk
* Seeds from ½ vanilla bean / 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 3 egg yolks
* 60g (S cup) granulated sugar
* ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
* 20g (2½ tablespoons) cornflour

#### Crumb topping:

* 90g (¾ cup) all purpose flour
* 65g (¾ cup) old-fashioned rolled oats (not instant)
* 75g (¼ cup + 2 tablespoons) granulated sugar
* ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, optional
* 100g (7 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted

#### Cake:

* 120g (½ cup + 1 teaspoon / 1 stick + 1 teaspoon) unsalted butter, softened
* 50g (¼ cup) granulated sugar
* 50g (¼ cup) light brown sugar
* 2 medium eggs, room temperature
* 155g (1 cup + S cup) all-purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon baking powder
* ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
* 120g (½ cup) sour cream
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

#### Directions

#### Poached rhubarb:

1. Preheat oven to 170°C (340°F). Toss chopped rhubarb with granulated sugar, orange juice, orange zest, star anise and grated / ground ginger.
2. Transfer to a roasting tin and bake in oven for 12  15 minutes, until the rhubarb stalks can be pierced with fork, but hasnt completely disintegrated yet.
3. Leave aside to cool. Refrigerate if youre making this the day before baking the cake.

#### Custard:

1. To make the custard, heat milk and scraped seeds from vanilla bean / vanilla extract in a saucepan over medium heat until simmering.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk egg yolks with cornflour, sugar and salt until mix has lightened in colour and sugar has dissolved.
3. Once milk is bubbling, pour half of the hot milk over the yolks to temper. Return the whole mixture to the saucepan.
4. Cook the mixture in the saucepan, whisking all the time, until the mixture is thick and bubbling (roughly 3 minutes). Pour into a bowl and press a cling film on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside to cool and refrigerate if making this the day before baking the cake.

#### Crumb topping:

1. Combine flour, oats, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a small bowl.
2. Pour melted butter and mix until it comes together. It will be lumpy. Set aside.

#### Cake:

1. Cream softened butter, granulated sugar and light brown sugar together with an electric hand mixer for 2-3 mins until light (it will take slightly longer if youre mixing with a spatula).
2. Add the eggs in one at a time, mixing the first one well before adding the second (the mixture might look curdled but it will come together in a bit).
3. Sift in flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Mix until just combined.
4. Stir through the sour cream and vanilla extract until everything is mixed well.

#### Assembly:

1. Preheat oven to 170°C (340°F).
2. Line an 8 inch (20cm) square pan with parchment paper, leaving enough overhang to catch the crumbs.
3. Pour the sour cream cake batter into the pan and smooth the surface.
4. Using a tablespoon, blob the custard across the surface. Spoon the rhubarb sticks evenly over the top, then sprinkle the oat crumb topping generously (making sure that there is still space for rhubarb and custard to peek through to allow for even baking).
5. Bake for 45  50min, until a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean without cake bits (there might be custard bits).
6. Leave to cool for at least 1 hour before slicing into squares. Enjoy with leftover poached rhubarb or on its own!",3814

For the Graham Cracker Crust:


* 		 1 1/2 cups (127 g or 7 graham crackers) finely ground graham cracker crumbs


* 		 1/3 cup white sugar


* 		 6 tablespoons butter, melted


For the Pie:


* 		 2 1/2 cups sweetened condensed milk, (about two 14 ounce cans)


* 		 3/4 cup sour cream


* 		 3/4 cup key lime juice


* 		 1 tablespoon grated lime zest


* 		Whipped cream for garnish, (optional)


Instructions


To make the Graham Cracker Crust:

* 		In a medium bowl, stir together graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter until well combined. Press mixture into a 9-inch pie plate. Bake at 375° F for 7 minutes. Cool completely.

To make the Pie:

* 		Preheat oven to 350°F.

* 		In a medium bowl, combine condensed milk, sour cream, lime juice and zest. Mix well and pour into baked graham cracker crust. Tap pie plate gently on the counter to release any air bubbles.

* 		Bake in preheated oven for 5 to 8 minutes, until the filling is set and barely jiggles. Do not brown. Chill pie thoroughly (at least 4 hours) before serving. Garnish with lime slices or zest and whipped cream if desired.


I followed the above - [this](https://www.spoonfulofflavor.com/6-ingredient-classic-key-lime-pie/) - recipe, but made a few adjustments. First, I included several biscoff cookies in the crust just because I had them on hand. 

With the filing, I substituted plain Greek yogurt for sour cream. 

I didnt have enough limes to make 3/4 cup so I added juice of a lemon and mandarin orange, making more of a citrus pie vs key lime. 

Cooked for maybe closer to 12 mins.

2021-05-06,7,"Homemade Chocolate Turtles","thecaglediaries"," 

### Ingredients

* 8oz Pecan Halves
* 12oz Soft Caramel Candy
* ½ Tablespoon Heavy Cream
* 7oz Chocolate Wafers (for melting), semi sweet
* 1 Tablespoon Coarse Sea Salt (optional)

### Instructions

1. **Step 1**: Arrange the Pecan Halves on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
2. **Step 2**: Add the caramels to a microwave safe bowl and add the heavy cream. Microwave on high for 30 seconds then give it a stir. If you think it needs more add another 15 seconds.
3. **Step 3**: Allow the caramel to cool just a little, then spoon about 1 Tablespoon of caramel over the arranged pecan halves.
4. **Step 4**: Melt the chocolate melting discs in the microwave, for 30 seconds. Stir. If more is needed go ahead in 15 second intervals. Allow to cool a little.
5. **Step 5**: Spoon about 1 Tablespoon of chocolate over the top of the caramel. Allow to cool somewhat.
6. **Step 6**: Sprinkle sea salt over each 'turtle' - this step is optional.
7. **Step 7**: Place baking sheet into refrigerator for about an hour, to set.

### Notes

The sea salt is optional, but recommended!

Depending on the caramel, you may need a little more or a little less cream. You don't want the caramel to be too soft that it sticks to everything and doesn't set enough - but you also don't want it to be crunchy. I used Werther's Original Soft Caramel for mine, with ½ Tablespoon of cream and it worked great.

I like to use 4 pecan halves for mine, but I've seen 3 used, as well as 5. This is your preference! I just told my kids that his head was inside his shell =

I think it's an interesting recipe and if you're interested, surprisingly quite simple to make, albeit takes some time (you can watch shows during the idle time!). [This is the video](https://youtu.be/0Y1lxTavKRg) showcasing the methodology, if you prefer a more visual approach. 



This type of cake is quite popular in Indonesia, and I think I've shown the texture justice here.



The Ingredients are - 

\- 200 ml thick coconut milk

\- 400 ml water

\- 150 gms tapioca flour

\- 75 gms all purpose flour

\- 200 gms sugar

\- 1 tsp vanilla powder (can substitute vanilla essence if you prefer)

\- 1/2 tsp salt

\- 1 heaped teaspoon instant coffee

\- 1/2 tbsp cocoa powder



The recipe is - 

\- Mix tapioca flour, all purpose flour, sugar, vanilla powder, salt

\- Add coconut milk and water stage by stage, until the sugar is completely dissolved

\- Strain the mixture

\- Divide into 3 by a ratio of 1:1:2. keep aside the bigger bowl

\- Mix together cocoa powder and water, strain and add into one of the bowls. Mix well.

\- Mix together instant coffee and water, strain and add into the other bowl. Mix well

\- Grab a cuboid baking pan and oil it well

\- Put inside steamer to warm up

\- Put 2 ladleful of your preferred batter (I went with chocolate first because it looks good as the first layer, remember, the first layer is the one on top.

\- Steam for 7 minutes

\- Add 2 ladleful of the plain batter and steam for 7 minutes

\- Repeat alternating between coffee and chocolate, with the plain batter in between.

\- Get as many layers as possible, after the last layer, steam for an additional 25 minutes.

\- Take it out and let it cool completely

2021-05-05,98,"Easy Clam Chowder","yellowjacquet","I LOVE clam chowder, its frequently my order if its on the menu, and back in the day I used to crack open the canned stuff for a quick dinner. Once I started making lots of homemade soups I found that I couldnt go back to canned soup anymore, which was a bummer because I also didnt want to go through the hassle of getting and handling fresh clams to make clam chowder myself. 

This recipe uses canned clams and its the perfect middle ground in my opinion! Canned clams are an excellent source of iron, and they are cheap and last for a long time in the pantry! 

# Ingredients

* 2  6.5 oz cans of clams
* 1  8 oz bottle of clam stock (clam juice) \*see note
* 2 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled and cut into \~1 cm cubes \*see note
* 4 strips of thick cut bacon (or 6 regular strips)
* 1 large white onion, diced
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 2 cups whole milk (can sub non-dairy)
* ¼ cup all-purpose flour
* T cup corn (from one cobb, or sub canned)
* 1 tbsp fresh thyme
* ½ cup shredded carrots (optional)
* 1 bay leaf (optional)
* Salt &amp; fresh cracked black pepper

# Instructions

1. Strain the clams over a measuring cup, reserving the liquid (should get about 1 cup total). Combined with the 8 oz bottle there will be 2 cups of clam stock, set this aside.
2. Heat a large, wide pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Cut the bacon into bite-sized pieces and cook it until it reaches your desired level of doneness (I like to let some get crispy and pull some off a little sooner). Remove to a paper towel lined plate and leave the drippings in the pot. 
3. Add the onions to the pot and cook in the bacon drippings until they soften, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Add some extra olive oil if the bacon drippings dont coat the bottom of the pot)
4. Add the potatoes, garlic, 1 tsp salt, and ¼ tsp pepper to the pot. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently.
5. Dust the flour evenly over the contents of the pot and cook, stirring frequently, for another \~3 minutes.
6. Add the milk and clam stock and stir until well-mixed. Add the bay leaf, thyme, carrots, and corn. Bring to a boil over high heat, and then reduce heat to medium-low to simmer until the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes (stirring occasionally to prevent potatoes from sticking to the pan's bottom). Add more salt and pepper to taste.
7. Add the clams and bacon bits to the soup 2-3 minutes before serving. Remove the bay leaf and serve the soup topped with more thyme and fresh cracked black pepper.

# Notes

* Serve in bread bowls or alongside crusty bread for dipping.
* Dicing the potatoes into small (\~1 cm) chunks is critical to the texture of the soup, the outsides of the pieces dissolve and contribute to the creaminess of the soup. If cut too large this won't be as effective.
* Clam stock (clam juice) can usually be found near the canned clams at the grocery store in 8 oz glass bottles.

2021-05-03,2,"The Best French Toast you will ever eat!","cteavin","I created a video on YouTube if you'd like to see the process in full. It starts with a bread pudding that you slice and fry -- it's sooo good. A crispy crust you break through to a melt in your mouth creaminess on the inside.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu3U0Avw7kM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu3U0Avw7kM)

Recipe

The proportions, so you can adjust the recipe, are 1 egg to 1 cup liquid to 1 cup dried/stale bread. For my loaf tin I use

* 5 large eggs
* 5 cups milk (you can substitute cream for a richer pudding)
* 1/4 cup brandy (any flavored liquid like syrups or liquor work well to personalize the flavor)
* 1/2 cup sugar (you can add up to 1.5 cups depending on how sweet you like it, because I pour syrup over it, I use less).
* The zests from 2 - 3 oranges (you can use lemons as well)
* Pinch of salt
* 1 tablespoon vanilla
* You can also mix in candied or dried fruits and/or nuts to suit your taste.
* 5 cups stale/dried bread

&amp;#x200B;

1. Zest oranges and add to sugar, then combine with 2 cups of milk and bring to the simmer. Turn off the heat and let sit until cool.
2. In a bowl whisk together five eggs, the salt, and any additional sugar you would like to use. Whisk in the orange flavored milk, the remaining 3 cups of milk, and all the flavorings. Strain to remove any solids.
3. In a bread tin lay out your dried bread (and fruits or nuts, if using) and then pour the liquid mixture over it. Let it sit overnight to fully rehydrate the bread.
4. Bake in a slow oven, 160C/320F for one hour. Let cool and refrigerate. Serve as is or with a sweet sauce -- at this point, you've made Bead Pudding, to make it into French Toast, slice the pudding and fry in hot oil or ghee for a few minutes on either side to develop a crust (this is my favorite way to eat bread pudding as the outside is crispy and the inside warm and creamy).

2021-05-02,49,"Classic Potato Chips!","entropy2421","My experience would lean towards the opposite. Fish, battered and fried at least, is far more fragile. Sliced potatoes fries very very easy. Next time you fry some fish try frying potatoes i guess. It definitely helps to blanch or even bake them if you have larger pieces but throwing shredded or thinly sliced potatoes   in a deep fryer pretty much always results in something very enjoyable. It helps to have the oil temp hot and cook them until they are browned and if you want fries you really do want to blanch and/or bake them first. I like to cut the potato into fries, rinse them, bake them, dry them, and then freeze them for frying later. Also, i've been really pleased with taking the cut fries and sous-vide in bags and then frying but that is a lot of effort for fries.

Buying a bag of fries from the freezer section is also a really easy thing if you haven't been doing that. Chips fry a lot easier though and running some potatoes through a mandolin and frying them in a deep fryer pretty much always turns out something really good.",1049

* 10 key limes
* 1/4 cup salt
* 2 cups of heavy cream

**Instructions**

Preheat the oven to 450 F (230 C). Line a baking sheet with foil or a silicone mat.

Combine water, butter, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add flour; stir with a wooden spoon until mixture comes together into a smooth dough and pulls away cleanly from the bottom of the pan.

Whisk eggs, one at a time, into the pastry, mixing well after each addition. Scoop pastry into a pastry bag and pipe into 6 to 8 buns on the baking sheet.

Mix butter, sugar, flour, and salt together in a large bowl using a spatula. The mixture should resemble slightly crumbly cookie dough.

Place dough between two sheets of waxed paper or inside a zip-loc bag. Press or roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Freeze crust until ready to use.

When ready, use a cookie cutter to cut crust into circles about the diameter of the buns. Lightly push crusts onto the buns.

Bake for 15 minutes and then reduce heat to 400 F (175 C) and bake for another 15 minutes. Transfer buns onto a cooling rack.

2021-05-01,4,"Best Pie Crust Recipe. Very Easy","maybesaydie","In a bowl or food processor combine:

100 grams (1/2 cup packed)  lard

210 grams (or 1 and 1/2 cups) All Purpose Flour

1/4-1/2 teaspoon Table Salt

1 Tablespoon Apple  Cider Vinegar Chilled

2 Tablespoons Ice Water

(Optional) 1 egg, beaten with a pinch of salt to aid browning.

*  **Food Processor method:**

* To flour, salt and lard mixture add the cider vinegar. Pulse for a few seconds. Check texture, add I tablespoon of water and pulse again.
Mixture should begin to have pea sized clumps of fat coated with flour. Test mixture by squeezing some in hand. If it sticks together, stop pulsing. If not add the remaining water in short pulses until it does. Because careful not to over process. Completed  dough should stick together in a clump but still have small visible chunks of fat.

Turn out dough onto plastic film. Bring together with your hands and shape int o disc. Cover with film and refrigerate until chilled through


* **Hand Method**

* Add ingredients (*except water and vinegar*) to a large nixing bowl. With a pastry cutter or fork combine  dry ingredients until they resemble peas in size and the flour coats the fat. Drizzle in vinegar and water slowly using only as much as you need to bring dough together. Be careful not to overwork mixture or the crust will be tough. Once dough comes together proceed as above.


When pastry is chilled roll to nine inches, place carefully in a pie plate, crimp edges by turning under excess crust and pinching and then fill. If crust cracks while rolling patch it together with your finger (it's very forgiving.)  Be sure to turn dough while rolling and roll from the center outwards. Avoid rolling edges too thin. If desired, egg wash exposed parts of pastry for better browning.


* You can fill this crust without pre-baking and the bottom will be flaky and dry. *The vinegar is essential, if you use only water the results won't be as flaky*. Cool pie completely before cutting. For a two crust pie double the  ingredients but remember to go easy when adding  the liquids.

**Ingredients**

Donuts

* 1 cup milk lukewarm
* 1 tbsp active dry yeast
* 1/3 cup granulated sugar
* 3 egg yolks
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 4 tbsp butter softened
* 4 1/4 cups flour all-purpose
* 1 1/2 tsp salt or to taste
* vegetable oil for frying

Custard filling

* 4 egg yolks
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 3/4 cup maple syrup
* 1/2 tsp salt or to taste
* 2 cups milk
* 1 tsp maple extract
* 2 tbsp butter unsalted, cold

Maple Glaze

* 2 cups icing sugar aka powdered sugar or confectioner's sugar
* 1 tbsp milk
* 1 1/2 tsp maple extract
* 6 slices bacon cooked and roughly chopped

**Instructions**

Dough

* Whisk the lukewarm milk, yeast, and 1 tsp of the sugar together. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes until the mixture becomes foamy. Whisk in the egg yolks and vanilla until well combined.
* Flour, butter, salt, remaining sugar, and prepared yeast mixture to the bowl of your stand mixer. Attach the dough hook to the mixer and start on low speed, working up to medium speed until the dough comes together. Knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is soft and elastic\*.
* Lightly grease a large mixing bowl. Shape the dough into a ball and place it into the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow the dough to rise in a warm, draft-free environment for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.

Custard

* Beat the egg yolks in a medium-sized mixing bowl just until smooth. Add the cornstarch, maple syrup, and salt to the bowl and continue to beat until combined and pale yellow, about 1 minute.
* Heat the milk in a saucepan over medium-high heat until it comes to a bare simmer. Remove the pan from the heat. Ladle the milk into the egg mixture, whisking until completely smooth between each ladle. Pour the mixture into the saucepan and return it to the stovetop over medium heat.
* Continuously whisk the mixture until it's bubbling and completely thickened. Remove the pot from the heat. Add the vanilla and butter and whisk until the custard is glossy and the butter has melted.
* Cover the custard with plastic wrap, carefully pressing the plastic directly against the surface of the custard. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours or until completely cooled.

Donuts

* Punch the risen dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough out until about 1/2"" thick.
* Use a 3"" biscuit or cookie cutter to cut rounds from the dough. You can knead the remaining dough back together to cut more rounds from it, but keep in mind the dough can become over-worked and result in donuts that aren't ideal.
* Place the rounds on a lightly greased baking sheet, leaving about 1"" of room between each one for room to rise. Lightly cover them with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow them to rise for 20-30 minutes, or until doubled in size.
* Fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot with 3-4 inches of vegetable oil. Carefully add 2-3 risen dough rounds to the oil. Cook for about 1 minute, or until golden brown, then flip and cook for another minute or until golden. Remove the donuts with a slotted spoon and allow them to drain on a paper towel-lined plate while you fry the remainder.

Fill &amp; Glaze

* Add the custard to a piping bag fitted with a piping tip. Insert a skewer or chopstick into each donut, moving it around to create a pocket inside for the custard. Insert the tip of your piping bag into the hole created by the skewer and fill with the donut with custard. Repeat with the remaining donuts and custard\*\*.
* Whisk the icing sugar, milk, and maple extract together until completely smooth. Taste the glaze and add more maple extract if needed. Dip the top of a donut into the glaze, then hold it on its side to let excess glaze drip off. Place the donut on a wire cookie rack and repeat with the remaining donuts.
* While the glaze is still wet, top each donut with the bacon pieces. Let the glaze set for 10-15 minutes before serving.

Notes

\*If the dough is **too sticky**, mix in 1 tbsp of flour at a time until smooth. If the dough is **too dry**, mix in 1 tbsp milk or water until smooth.

\*If you end up with extra custard, you can enjoy it like pudding! Top it with a drizzle of the glaze and some bacon pieces.",4301

For full recipe (including a recipe for Chinese Five Spice, tips, and tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/salt-and-pepper-chicken/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/salt-and-pepper-chicken/)

INGREDIENTS 

* 15 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs
* 1 c vegetable oil
* 1 Tbsp kosher salt
* 1/2 Tbsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 1 Tbsp Chinese Five Spice (or find recipe at link above)
* 1/4 c cornstarch
* 1 medium onion, chopped (about 2 cups)
* 2 hot peppers, finely chopped (about 1 Tbsp)
* 4 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 Tbsp)
* 5 scallions, chopped in 1/2"" pieces
* Basil (optional)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Before heating the pan, have all the ingredients measured, chopped, and ready to go.
* Chop the onions, hot peppers, garlic, and scallions. 
* Mix the Five Spice and cornstarch in a bowl.
* Chop about 15 oz of boneless, skinless chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces. Make sure theyre dry so the spice/cornstarch mixture will be evenly distributed. 
* Add the chopped chicken to the bowl with the spices and toss in the mixture. Use your hands to really rub the mixture into every nook and cranny of the chicken pieces. 
* Heat about one cup of neutral vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat. The idea here is to have enough oil that it covers the bottom of the pan by about 1/4.
* Fry the chicken in batches if necessary. You dont want them to touch each other in the pan. Depending on the size of the chicken pieces, it takes about 5 to 7 minutes to be fully cooked. If youre not sure if theyre done, take one out and cut it in half. Better to check than to guess. 
* When the chicken is done, place on a plate with a paper towel.
* Drain excess oil from the pan, but leave about one tablespoon. Bring to high heat.
* Add onion and hot peppers to the pan and stir for two minutes. 
* Add the garlic, scallion, and a pinch of salt (1/8 tsp) to the pan for one minute.
* Finally, toss in the cooked chicken, mix it all together, and youre done!
* Serve in a bowl with chopsticks. If you have some fresh basil around, chiffonade a bunch and sprinkle it on top. Its a wonderful aromatic to add another layer of flavor. Enjoy!",2189

*Serves ~6 people*

*I eyeballed the ingredient amounts but will try and write approximations.*

Ingredients:

* ~2.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
* ~20 cloves of garlic finely chopped, ground, or minced
* 5-6 stalks worth of basil leaves (use holy basil or regular basil here)
* 1-2 heads of broccoli
* 1 yellow onion
* 1 red bell pepper

* Oyster sauce (~10 tbsp for marinade and another 4 tbsp for stir fry sauce)
* 2 tbsp Hoisin sauce
* 1 tsp Fish sauce
* 1.5 tbsp Light soy sauce
* 1.5 tbsp Dark/sweet soy sauce
* A few pinches of corn starch
* A few pinches of MSG if you have it although I forgot it this time and still tasted great
* 1 tbsp sugar (also optional - the sauces already add some sweetness)

Procedure:

Slice the chicken into strips and then marinate in plenty of oyster sauce for at least 30 min to an hour but the longer the better.  Fry the chicken strips in peanut oil or another good frying oil on medium heat for ~ 5 minutes on each side or until you see the sauce begin to caramelize on the chicken and it's cooked through.  Set your chicken aside and then, if necessary, add a little more oil to the pan and throw in all of your minced garlic.  Turn up the heat here to high and once the garlic starts to brown slightly, throw in all of your chopped-up veggies.  Fry the veggies until you see them start to brown and then turn down the heat to medium-low and throw in all of your sauces along with the chicken.  Throw in the corn starch, MSG, and sugar, give this a good mix, and cook on medium-low for a minute or two.  Finally, kill the heat or turn down to the lowest setting and add in the basil.  Stir the basil around until it gets all saucy and nice.  It's important not to really cook the basil but to let the very low or residual heat and sauce do their work on it while you mix it in.",1860

The squid is deep fried and then stir fried for a short time.  Cooking squid this way makes it so satisfyingly crispy while feeling refreshing with a spicy kick.

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/--dquogU9GY)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

\- 350g squid rings

\- 2 small green chili peppers

\- 1/2 red bell pepper

\- 2-3 cloves of garlic

\- 1 green onion

&amp;#x200B;

**Salt and Pepper Spice Powder:**

\- 10g salt

\- 2g black pepper

\- 1g Sichuan peppercorn

\- 1g cayenne pepper

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Toast the dry spices (black pepper and Sichuan peppercorn) for 8 min using medium heat. This step will make them release the fragrance.
2. Take the spices out and grind them into powder. The freshly toasted spice powder is much more fragrant than the store-bought powder. Add the salt and cayenne pepper. Mix well. (This is the salt and pepper spice powder that can be used in many dishes and I find it very useful for seasoning)
3. Chop the green onions, green peppers, red peppers, and garlic for later use.
4. Season the squid using half of the salt and pepper spice powder about 7 grams. Add 1 egg. Mix well. Add 2 tablespoons of corn starch. Mix well.
5. Coat the squid using a mixture of two different types of flours. I used cornstarch and tapioca starch. (The tapioca starch is very light. It can make the calamari crispier. You can also use rice flour for this purpose.)
6. Deep frying: wait for the oil to reach 300^(o)F or 150^(o)C. Deep fry up to 8 calamari rings at one time, otherwise the oil temperature will drop rapidly and the calamari will be soggy. Take them out when they become golden. It took me about 3-4 minutes.
7. Remove all the calamari rings and leave a little bit oil in the pan. Use medium heat and stir-fry the garlic, green peppers, red peppers, and green onions for about 1 minute to release their fragrance. Then add back the beautiful golden calamari and one teaspoon of salt and pepper spice powder. Mix everything well. Enjoy!",2137

2021-04-25,40,"Boudin Balls","thecaglediaries","Ingredients

* 2lb Boudin Sausage Links
* 2 Large Eggs
* ½ Cup Buttermilk
* 1 Tablespoon Creole Seasoning
* 2 Cups Breadcrumbs, plain
* 1 Teaspoon Onion Powder
* 1 Teaspoon Garlic Powder
* 1 Cup All Purpose Flour
* Oil, for frying

## Instructions

1. Remove casing from Boudin Sausage links with kitchen shears.
2. Roll Boudin Sausage meat into 1-½"" Balls, then refrigerate for 1 hour or more.
3. Beat eggs in a medium sized bowl.
4. Add the buttermilk to the eggs and mix together.
5. In another medium sized bowl mix the seasonings with the breadcrumbs.
6. Set up your dredging stations, with the flour in a bowl first, then the egg/buttermilk mix and last the breadcrumb mix.
7. Remove the boudin balls from the refrigerator and coat each one in the flour first, then into the egg/buttermilk mix and last the breadcrumbs.
8. Heat frying oil to 350°F (at least 2"" deep) and fry until golden (about 3-4 minutes). Serve right away with a dip.

## Notes

Depending on the brand of Boudin Sausage that you buy, some are more dry/wet than others. Our favorite boudin is on the dryer side so I sprinkle the sausage meat with a little water to get the mixture to stick together well. If your chosen boudin sausage is too wet try to squeeze the fluid out while rolling.

Putting the Boudin Balls into the refrigerator (or freezer) will ensure it doesn't fall apart before you coat and fry them.

Ingredients (makes around 12 sandwiches): 

Pulled pork: 

2lb pork shoulder 

1/2 onion 

1 stalk celery 

2-3 cup chicken stock 

1 tbsp white vinegar 

2 tbsp brown sugar 

1/2 tsp paprika 

1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 

1 tbsp garlic powder 

2 tbsp sugar 

2 tsp salt 

1.5 tbsp tomato paste

3 tbsp AP flour  

&amp;#x200B;

Brioche buns: 

20g flour + 100g milk (tangzhong) 

375g bread flour 

45g sugar 

2 tsp yeast 

1 tsp salt 

3 eggs (\~150g) 

1 egg yolk 

100g milk 

60g butter, cut into small pieces.

Egg wash  

&amp;#x200B;

Sandwich: Pickles (optional) 

&amp;#x200B;

Instructions:

1. Optionally parboil the pork shoulder for \~5m on high heat to get rid of some of the blood. Cut into chunks and sear on a pan until all sides take a light color. Then, add around 2 cups of chicken stock to the pan and bring to a boil.
2. Transfer the pork shoulder and soup to the Instant Pot. Add in 1 tbsp white vinegar, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 2 tbsp sugar, 2 tsp salt, and 1.5 tbsp tomato paste to the pot as well.
3. Sautee the onion and celery on medium heat for \~5m and add to the pot. Move the contents to pack it in as tightly as possible and add more chicken stock to just reach the top of the contents.
4. Pressure cook on high for 90m.
5. For the buns, make the tangzhong by cooking 20g flour with 100g milk on medium low heat until the mixture forms a paste.
6. In a bowl, mix together 375g bread flour, 45g sugar, 2 tsp yeast, 1 tsp salt, 3 eggs + 1 extra egg yolk, 100g milk.
7. Knead until it becomes a smooth and uniform dough. It will be sticky and appear to be way too wet at the beginning, but keep at it, and it should come together. If it's still too difficult, add in flour a spoon at a time and continue kneading.
8. Once a general ball of dough forms, add in the 60g butter in increments to the dough and knead the pieces in.
9. The end product should be smooth and soft dough that feels tacky, but doesn't stick to your hand. this kneading part is a bit hard to describe concisely, so please watch the video as it's worth more than 1000 words :)
10. Let the dough rise for 1h. After rising, give the dough a very brief knead (1m or less) to just deflate it. Then, separate into balls around 80g in mass. Roll into spheres as uniformly as possible and cover with a piece of plastic wrap to let rise for a second time for 20-30m, or until the buns approximately double in size.
11. Apply a light coat of egg wash to the risen buns and bake at 375F for 20-25m.
12. Now, back to the pulled pork. Open the pressure cooker and take out the pork, leaving the juices inside. Turn the Instant Pot to sautee mode so that it boils the juices. Separately, prepare some roux by dissolving around 2-3 tbsp flour in a 1/4 cup of water. You should get a white fluid that's not too thick. Then, while continuously mixing the roux to prevent precipitation, pour it into the boiling sauce and mix vigorously to combine. The sauce should thicken. Adjust the amount of roux as necessary to get to your desired consistency, and keep in mind that once cooled, the viscosity will go up a bit more than when it's hot.
13. Separate the pork by mashing it using a potato masher or forks. Cut open the buns and serve with the sauce and any other of your favorite toppings. Bon apetit",3458

* 2 tablespoons tobiko
* 3 oz. poached shrimp
* 1 Nori sheet, cut in half
* 1 avocado
* 1 small cucumber
* 1 small carrot

# Direction

**Step 1**

Set the bamboo mat in front of you.

Cover it with a piece of plastic foil. It will keep the rice from sticking to the mat.

Cut the Nori sheet in half (its possible to use scissors), and put it on the bamboo mat.

**Step 2**

Spread half the rice on the Nori sheet. Twist the rice and Nori (I lift it with the plastic foil), so the rice is around the floor, and the Nori is at the top.

Skin and slice the avocado and cucumber into matchstick patterns. I also like to remove the cucumber seeds.

Put avocado, cucumbers, and shrimp in addition to the Nori sheet.

**Step 3**

Put your thumbs under the bamboo mat and lift gently. Start folding the sushi, but see not to roll the bamboo mat in it.

Lift the bamboo mat and the plastic foil. Cover the rice with tobiko.

Cover the rice with all the plastic foil and place it over the bamboo mat so that the tobiko sticks to the sushi roll.

Let it stand for 5 minutes.

2021-04-21,48,"Juicy Burger At Home","Bvjiglag","Just try it next time. Even a cast iron pan will work great. I do mine on a cast iron griddle in my grill. For what Id like you to try, youre going to want to mandolin a sweet onion on its thinnest setting so you have transparent thin cuts. Make 4 oz balls of chuck/sirloin, this 4oz part is important. You dont want to go bigger. You can always make it a double if you want more meat. Then throw the first meatball onto the hot skillet and use a large, heavy duty, steel spatula to push down and smash the hamburger meat (there are specific kitchen tools that will make this much easier but this is what I had/did). You may need a wooden spoon to help push the spatula down further with your other arm. Once smashed you slide the spatula off the meat with downward pressure as to not lift the meat away when lifting the spatula. The wooden spoon also helps there. Next, you season the meat with salt and pepper, grab a bunch of onion slices and mound them over the burger patties. When you close the grill the onion juices will start to release into the meat. After 3-4 minutes, depending on how hot your skillet is, its time to flip the burger and onions over. Now the burger is steaming in the onion juices while the onion is caramelizing.  Season this side with salt and pepper. Wait another 3 minutes and you open the grill to flip the patty right side up and throw on, over the onions, a slice of provolone or cheddar. This is followed by placing the top bun over the room temperature Cheese and the bottom bun sitting on top. Almost like the bottom bun leap frogging the top bun if that makes sense. Another minute and its done, the cheese is melted. Slide your spatula under the meat, grab the bottom bun that is sitting on the top bun, then slide under the meat as you pull the spatula away. Im telling you its glorious.",1838

2021-04-20,36,"Taco Seasoning","darkbarrage99","It should really be called texmex seasoning, but there's a culture around ""taco kits"" you can buy at grocers in the us that are very cumin heavy.  They typically come with prepackaged flour tortillas and/or formed tostada's, a package of some kind of salsa and a package of the seasoning mentioned above.  Generally the idea is to brown ground beef and add the seasoning to the beef until it's cooked into the meat.  

It's so popular in the United States, there's an entire chain devoted to these types of tacos called Taco Bell.  Check out the subreddit if you'd like to know more.

It's essentially a slap in the face to Mexican cuisine, but a lot of us americans from working class families grew up with it as a kind of comfort food.

2021-04-20,29,"Homemade Mixed Berry Pie!","MessInTheKitchen","You can find metric measurements and the full recipe [here](https://messinthekitchen.com/mixed-berry-pie/)!

**Ingredients**

Pie Crust

* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp salt or to taste
* 1 tbsp granulated sugar or to taste
* 1 cup butter cold, cut into 1/2"" cubes
* 6-10 tbsp water ice cold

Berry Filling

* 5 cups berries I used strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 tsp lemon zest
* 2 tbsp butter cut into small pieces

Instructions

Pie Crust

* Add the flour, salt, and sugar to your food processor. Pulse a few times to blend everything together. Add the butter and continue to pulse until the cubes turn into pea-sized pieces. Drizzle 6 tbsp of water over the flour and butter mixture in the food processor. Pulse until chunky, coarse, and crumbly.
* Turn the mixture out onto a clean surface. Continue to add water, 1-2 tbsp at a time, until the dough comes together. Split the dough in half and form into 2 disks, wrap them well with plastic wrap, and transfer to the fridge for 2 hours.
* Unwrap one of the disks (leaving the other one in the fridge), and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out, carefully, keeping the circular shape, until it's about 1/8"" thick. Place it over a 9"" pie dish and trim the edges with a sharp knife.

Berry Filling

* Preheat the oven to 400F. Toss the berries with the sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice. and lemon zest. Spoon the mixture into the prepared pie crust. Dot the top of the berries with the small pieces of butter.
* Unwrap and roll out the other disk of pie crust. You can place it directly over top of the berries, or try a design like the lattice style in the photos.
* **Optional:** Brush the top of the pie crust with egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar\*\*.\*\*
* Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until the pie crust is golden brown. Let the pie cool fully to room temperature, then transfer to the fridge for at least 2 hours. Ideally overnight. Slice and serve.

Notes

**How to create a lattice-style pie crust top:**

1. Roll the pie dough on a floured surface to about 1/83 in thickness. The diameter should be slightly larger than the pie plate. Use a sharp knife or a pizza cutter to slice strips from the dough. I sliced mine just under 13/2 cm, but yours can be any thinness or thickness youd like.
2. Grab strands of pie dough, matching the lengths of dough with the length needed for the pie plate, and place over the top of the pie, with as much or little space as you want.
3. Still matching strands of dough to the pie plate, start to weave the lattice. Weave by folding back every other strand already on the pie, and placing a new strand down at a 90-degree angle. Bring the folded strands back down over the new strand. Fold back every other strand that hadnt been folded back before, and place a new strand. Repeat until the top of the pie is covered.
4. Trim any excess dough from the edges and pinch the strands into the edge of the crust. You can leave them like that, or pinch everything together to create your desired design on the crust.",3134
2021-04-20,69,"Delicious Egg Fried Rice in 15 Minutes! Great Way To Use Leftover Rice!","BigBadAl","I have lived with a Chinese girl for 20 years. I have worked in a Chinese restaurant for 15 of those. We make egg fried rice regularly. This is **not** Chinese egg fried rice.

The egg always goes in first. **Always**.

I've never seen egg fried rice made with oyster sauce. Or with the onions being added before the last 30 seconds. I'm not saying it won't work, but I've never seen it.

It should only take 5 minutes at the most to make egg fried rice. Prep your ingredients before starting, and cook it over a high heat. Medium heat just doesn't work.

Try this instead:

Whisk 2, 3, or 4 eggs in a bowl.

Put yesterday's rice into a large container and use the spatula to break it up so there are no clumps bigger than 1cm.

Add a teaspoon of oil to your wok and put it over a high heat. Keep the heat high throughout.

Add the whisked egg. Move it around as it forms tendrils.

Add the rice and mix it with the egg vigorously.

Add about a teaspoon of **light** soy sauce so that the rice takes on a light tan. Keep mixing vigorously.

Throw in a good handful of frozen peas. Mix vigorously.

Serve when the peas soften.

If you want bacon fried rice the use a scissors to cut the bacon into bite sized pieces into the hot oil before adding the egg. Cook it for 2-3 minutes before adding the egg then following the rest.",1325

**tortilla de patatas with gochujang &amp; woody herbs (aka a spicy spanish omelette)**

makes enough for 4 (or 2 hungry people)

&amp;#x200B;

*ingredients*

"" 4 medium waxy potatoes

"" 1 large onion, yellow or white

"" 4-6 cloves of garlic (4 if large, 6 if small)

"" any combination of your favourite woody herbs (thyme, rosemary, sage, oregano, marjoram, bay), dried and/or fresh\*, about a small palmful in total

"" 2 teaspoons gochujang

"" 4 eggs

"" olive oil

"" salt

"" chili flakes

\*as a general rule, 1 Tablespoon fresh herbs will be as potent as 1 teaspoon of dried ones

&amp;#x200B;

*preparation*

1. Thinly slice the potatoes lengthwise. Then do the same with the onion, cutting it in half lengthwise first, then across each half. Peel and finely slice the garlic cloves.
2. In a frying pan on medium heat, add enough olive oil to generously coat the bottom of the pan. Once the oil is hot, add in the potatoes and a pinch of salt. With a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, gently stir the potatoes around so as to coat them in the oil.
3. We dont want to the potatoes to get any colour on them, so as soon as you hear them starting to fry, add in a generous splash of hot water from your kettle and swirl it around. Repeat two or three more times as the water cooks the potatoes and evaporates away, adding most of the herbs in between.
4. Add the onion to the pan along with an additional glug of olive oil and small sprinkle of salt, topping up with a bit of hot water as it cooks the onion and potato and evaporates (as in step 3). In between additions of water, swirl in the gochujang, making sure to coat the potatoes and onion well.
5. While the potatoes and onion are cooking, crack and whisk the eggs in a large bowl along with a small pinch of salt.
6. Once the potatoes and onions are cooked (and all the water has evaporated), after about 10-15 minutes, remove them from the heat. Add a small spoonful to the eggs first  this will help warm them up and prevent them from scrambling when you add the rest of the hot ingredients. Add another spoonful of the potato mixture, stir it through, then pour in all the rest. Gently stir together and let the egg and potato mixture sit for 5-15 minutes so it can thicken while the the flavours get acquainted.
7. To a small pan (about 20 cm / 8 inches in diameter) on medium-high heat, add enough olive oil to cover its bottom. Once the oil is hot, pour in the egg and potato mixture and use your spatula or wooden spoon to flatten and level the mixture. Sprinkle with half of your leftover herbs. After a couple of minutes, reduce the heat to medium and let cook undisturbed until the sides have set and look golden, and the top is still slightly runny. This will take around 15 minutes in total.
8. To finish cooking the tortilla, it needs to be flipped. Cover the pan with a large upturned plate, hold the handle near the pan and press the plate downwards, then confidently flip the tortilla out of the pan and onto the plate before gently sliding it back into the pan. Use your spatula or spoon to tuck in the edges and let cook for a further 5 minutes or so until the bottom is set.
9. Flip the tortilla again to remove it from the pan. Garnish the top with the rest of your herbs, extra olive oil, flaky salt and chili flakes.
10. Cut into wedges and enjoy! Pairs well with a green salad, and can be enjoyed hot as well as cold, as a main dish, snack or appetizer, at any time of day.

### Ingredients

FOR THE PASTRY: 

* 2 sheets frozen Puff Pastry 
* Flour for dusting 
* 1 Egg 
* 1 Tablespoon Water 

\-----------------

* FOR THE CREAM CHEESE FILLING:

* Icing sugar for dusting

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

### Instructions    

FOR THE PASTRY: 

* Thaw the puff pastry according to package instructions. 
* Heat the oven to 400° F, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. 
* Make an egg wash by beating 1 egg plus 1 tablespoon of water together with a fork, and set aside. 
* Lightly flour your works surface, then roll one of the  sheets out to approximately 183x123 (around the size of your baking  sheet) 
* Use a metal biscuit cutter to cut out six 4.53-53 circles and then place them on the baking sheet. 
* Roll out the second sheet of puff pastry like you did  the first, except after cutting the circles, use a slightly smaller  cutter to cut out the center of each circle, creating an outer ring. 
* Use the egg wash to brush each dough circle on the  baking tray with the egg wash, then carefully lay one of the dough rings  on top, matching the edges. Brush the top of the rings with the egg  wash, then uses a fork to poke several holes in the center of the pasty  which will help keep the middle from puffing up too much. 
* Immediately place in the hot oven and bake for 13-15 minutes until puffed and golden. 
* Remove from oven and transfer each pastry to a wire rack to cool completely. 

\---------------

FOR THE CREAM CHEESE FILLING: 

* Place all the filling ingredients except the orange  zest into a medium sized mixing bowl and mix with an electric mixer on  high speed until light and fluffy. Stir in orange zest. 

\---------------

ASSEMBLING THE PASTRIES: 

* If needed, use the back of a spoon to gently push down  the center of each cooled pastry. Divide the cream cheese filling  between the pastries, putting a  generous spoonful of the filling in the  center of the pastry. 
* Use an egg slicer or knife to thinly slice a large  strawberry. Slightly fan the strawberry out and carefully lay it on top  of the cream cheese filling. 
* Dust the pastry with icing sugar and serve immediately. 

\---------------

NOTE: 

* If you are not serving immediately, store the  un-filled shells, filling, and strawberries separately then assemble no  more than a couple of hours before serving.",2619
2021-04-19,3,"How to make dashi","cteavin","I have a video which details everything, if you'd like a reference.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ5L1yI8CHE&amp;lc=UgydBice0rxS2N\_Bfv54AaABAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ5L1yI8CHE&amp;lc=UgydBice0rxS2N_Bfv54AaABAg)

The process is simple but keep in mind that there are dozens of varieties of kelp (kombu) and katsuo (bonito) that people use, so it's easier to think in terms of ratio when making dashi. Keep notes as to the proportion and ingredients you use so you can learn how to adjust. Having said that, the basic ratio is 1 - 2 percent konbu and katsuo to water (I have a chef friend who uses 3% katsuo, so there's a lot of personal preference involved).

**Ingredients**

* 1000ml water
* 10-20 grams konbu (dried kelp)
* 10-20 grams katsuo flake (bonito flakes)

**Directions**

1. Soak the konbu over night, but no more than 24 hours or the water becomes 'slimy'. Remove the konbu and when you're ready, proceed to step two.
2. Heat that water to the simmer and add your katsuo flakes. Keep the water under the boil and cook for no more than two minutes (if and when the katsuo sinks to the bottom of the pan, that's the sign the dashi is finished).
3. Strain through a fine mesh sieve, paper towel, or coffee filter to remove any particulate (for the clearest possible soup) -- do not press the solids.

Now you have dashi.

To make 'soup' for osumono (Japanese seasonal soups)

**Ingredients**

* 1 teaspoon light soy sauce
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 400ml of the dashi

**Directions**

1. add the salt and soy sauce to the dashi and bring to a simmer. Ladle into bowls of cubed tofu, poached fish, or seasonal vegetables.

2021-04-18,67,"Cochinita Pibil Tacos with Pickled Red Onion &amp; Homemade Cornmeal Tortillas","mienczaczek","Cochinita Tacos are one of the most popular foods in the Mexican region of Yucatan. Pork meat is prepared by marinating in a unique spice blend called Red Recado and slow-cooked in fruit juices over a period of 21 hours. The meat is then mixed with the cooking juices, served on a corn tortilla with red onion pickle. Taco is garnished with cilantro or parsley. Sometimes salsa or guacamole is also served as a topping but it is a personal preference.

At home, I used a slow-cooker on a low setting. 8 pm start for the overnight cook, meat was ready lunchtime on the following day. The only side effect of this method of cooking is sleepless night as the delicious aromas keep you awake...

## What kind of meat is used for Cochinita Pibil Tacos?

Traditionally, hairless Mexican pig is used for Cochinitas. For the top-quality meat, pigs are raised in an organic setting, fed with a variety of fruit, grass, grains and vegetables. Papaya is their most beloved feed on the menu giving the pork a unique flavour. Almost all parts of the animal are used for recipe ranging from ears, cheeks, main body to offal.

To prepare Cochinitas at home I choose Pork shoulder as my preference. Next time I will definitely try ribs or belly.

Remember to choose the best quality meat from sources that respect animal life and consumers health!

=÷=÷

## What is a Red Recado Spice blend?

Pears are a perfect fruit for charring and these charred pears with harissa chickpeas are an incredible way to use them.

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 30 minutes

Total Time: 40 minutes

Servings: 4 

Calories: 363kcal 

### Equipment

* Wide skillet

### Ingredients

* 4 pears quartered and seeds removed
* 1 tablespoon oil for frying
* 1 yellow onion peeled and sliced into half-moons
* 1 tablespoon plant-based butter optional
* 1-2 tablespoons harissa paste or use a mix of chili powder, paprika, and cayenne powder
* 2 cups vegetable stock
* 2 15- ounce cans of chickpeas drained
* 3 ounces baby spinach
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Flaky sea salt optional
* Minced parsley or any herb of your choice optional, for garnish

### Instructions

#### Cook the pears:

* Heat the oil in a wide skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pears in batches, cut-side down, and cook without moving for 2-5 minutes. The sugars may burn slightly, but you want to get a nice char. Tip the pear onto the other cut side and cook that side until it chars; an additional 2-5 minutes.
* You dont need to cook the skin side of the pear. If your pears arent very ripe, youll want to cook them a little longer to allow them to soften, but very ripe pears dont need to cook long. Transfer the charred pears to a plate and sprinkle with salt.

#### Cook the onion:

* Add the onion to the skillet and cook for 8-10 minutes until it begins to softenseason with salt and pepper. Melt the plant-based butter (if using) into the onion. Once frothy, add the harissa paste (or spices) and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

#### Simmer the chickpeas:

* Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Add the chickpeas. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until the broth has reduced slightly and the onions have softenedabout 15 minutes. If the liquid reduces too much, add a bit more stock or watertaste and season with salt and pepper.
* Stir in the spinach and cook for 5 minutes until wilted. Turn off the heat.

#### To serve:

* Ladle the chickpeas between bowls and arrange the charred pear on top. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro. Enjoy!

The **Pistachio and Chocolate Tart** requires three main preparations:

1. sablé dough with almond flour (to be prepared one day in advance)

2. bavarian cream with pistachio

3. dark chocolate glaze.

You will also need a handful of shelled pistachios for decoration, and 100 g of white chocolate for the chablonage of the shortcrust pastry

* Pistachio cream: 70 g
* Isinglass: 6 g
* Heavy cream: 200 g
* Caster sugar: 30 g (for the semi-whipped cream)

Concerning the Pistachio cream, you can prepare it at home (there are many recipes available based on cream, or water and sugar) or buy it ready-made. For this cake I used a store-bought cream, being careful to choose a quality that had a high content of pistachios, which should not be less than 45% by weight.

Start preparing the English Cream: mix together milk, heavy cream and grated lemon peel, and heat until the boiling state. At this point turn off the heat and stir the egg yolks that were previously whipped with sugar and salt. When the cream has reached a smooth consistency, filter it through a colander and let it rest to cool it down. When it reaches approximately 45 °C, add the pistachio cream and make the mixture homogeneous with the help of an immersion blender.

Rehydrate the isinglass in cold water for 5 minutes. Squeeze it well and add it to the cream, mixing until completely dissolved.

Mix together heavy cream and sugar, and beat until you get a semi-whipped consistency. Add the English Cream with pistachio, only after this one has reached room temperature, and mix it at very low speed.

Rehydrate the gelatin in cold water. Heat the heavy cream with water and sugar in a saucepan. When it reaches the boiling point, turn off the heat, add the rehydrated gelatin (drained) and cocoa. Mix well with a whisk, then blend trying to incorporate as little air as possible, and finally filter with a colander.

When the preparation has reached room temperature, it is ready to be used on the tart.

The shell of the tart is made by blind-baking the sablè shortcrust using a micro-perforated ring over a silicon mat. As already said, such a technique requires special attention and a relatively longer process compared to other cooking methods, but the result is excellent.

The dough is rolled out to a thickness of 3 mm; the base and strips that will be used for the edges of the shell are cut out separately. After a short passage in the freezer, the dough is assembled on the base and on the edges of the ring (which was previously brushed with melted butter).

The ring shall be placed on a micro-perforated silicone mat and left to rest in the freezer for at least 40 minutes. Once removed from the freezer, make a few holes with the fork on the base of the tart, and bake it in the convection oven at 175°C for about twenty minutes. If the procedure has been done correctly, the edges of the shell will not collapse during baking, and the result will be a perfect shell with even edges.

Once the shell is cooled, brush the base and edges with melted white chocolate. 100g of chocolate are enough for this size of cake. Let the chocolate cool and gain solid consistency before adding the cream.

Gently pour the Bavarian Cream with Pistachio into the shell, and level with a spatula. Leave at least a couple of millimetres from the top edge of the pastry so that there is room for the chocolate.

To achieve the mirror effect with the chocolate, the tart must be cooled for at least half an hour in the freezer. After this time you can gently pour the icing, moving the base until the glaze covers the entire surface, but being careful not to go beyond the edge of the shortcrust pastry.

While the glaze is still hot, sprinkle some shelled pistachios over the top.

Let the tart rest in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before serving.

2021-04-15,47,"Strawberry pastries inspired by The Wise Man's Fear","fantasycookery","Here's the recipe [link](https://fantasycookery.com/kingkiller-chronicle-strawberry-pastries/)

# Ingredients 

* 4 large egg yolks
* ½ cup light brown sugar
* ½ teaspoon Kosher salt
* 4 tablespoons cornstarch 
* 2 cup whole milk
* 2 teaspoon vanilla
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened and cut into small pieces
* 1 17.3 ounce box defrosted puff pastry
* 1 cup strawberry jam, warmed
* 1 egg yolk + 1 tablespoon cold water, whisked together 
* Coarse demerara sugar
* Honey (optional)
* Strawberries for decorating

# Instructions

**Step 1**

In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, brown sugar, and salt  stir in the cornstarch. In a medium-sized pot, heat the milk over medium heat. Temper the egg mixture by slowly whisking in a small amount of the hot milk.

Slowly whisk the tempered egg mixture into the remaining hot milk. Keep whisking until the mixture thickens for about five minutes. If the cream isnt thickening, increase the heat a bit. The pastry cream is ready when its slightly thicker than pudding. Once thick, remove from heat and stir in both the vanilla and softened butter  whisk out any remaining lumps. Strain the pastry cream into a clean medium-sized bowl using a fine mesh strainer or sieve.

Immediately cover the surface of the pastry cream with plastic wrap. Make sure to press down on the plastic wrap so its touching the whole surface of the pastry cream. This prevents skins from forming on the pastry cream. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours.

**Step 2**

After the custard is finished cooling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Counter thaw the puff pastry for about 30 minutes (dont allow the pastry to get too warm because it will shrink when baking). Line two half sheet pans with parchment paper. Prepare the thawed puff pastry by laying it out flat on a clean cutting board. Cut the puff pastry into 12 evenly sized rectangles. 

Place 6 rectangles on each half sheet pan. Using a sharp knife,  score around the edges of each rectangle of puff pastry  leaving a several centimeter border. Brush each pastry rectangle with the prepared egg wash and generously sprinkle with demerara sugar  focusing on the border.  Bake the pastries in batches for 14 minutes. While the first batch is baking, place the second in the refrigerator to keep the pastry cool.

Remove from the oven, and using a sharp knife carefully cut through the score marks that surround the center rectangle. You want the center of the pastry to collapse while its still soft and warm. Transfer each pastry with a depressed center to a wire rack to completely cool. Repeat the process with the second batch. 

**Step 3**

Once cooled, heat the strawberry jam in a small saucepan over low heat. Spoon several tablespoons of warm jam into each pastry divot  allow to cool for 20 minutes.  Slice the strawberries and coat them with honey (optional)  set aside. Using a piping bag with a star tip, pipe the pastry cream in small dots on top of the jam filled divot.  Decorate with the honey covered strawberries.

2021-04-14,15,"Classic French Croissants (Homemade)","jonathanklein4444","*I learned how to make croissants in a baking class in NYC and was surprised at how easy they were! Ive made these croissants at home countless times since and they never fail. I wrote out the directions as clearly as I could, but if you need additional visual instruction I will link a video demonstration below. Happy Baking!*  
  
**Croissant Recipe (Makes about 12 croissants)**  
<¥ [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/ELrxoheplDE)  
 
  
    
**Ingredients**
  
For the Dough:
*     270g High Gluten Flour (I use Bread Flour)
*     270g All Purpose Flour
*     13g Sea Salt
*     60g Granulated Sugar
*     45g Unsalted Butter, at room temperature
*     33g Fresh Yeast 
*     155g Cold Water
*     155g Cold Milk

For the Lamination:
*     300g Cold Salted European Butter (I recommend Président butter, but if you cant find that go with a high quality European style butter that has 12g fat per serving on the nutrition label)  
  
  
    
**Instructions**  
  

*Prepare the Detrempe:*
  
    1.    In the stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix together both flours, salt and sugar. Add the unsalted butter into the mixture and mix for about 10 minutes or until the butter no longer appears.
    2.    In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in the cold water and milk. Add to the flour mixture and mix for no longer than 30 secondsit should just come together. Be careful not to over mix.
    3.    Without flouring the table or your hands, transfer the dough and knead about 10 times, until the dough becomes smooth. Shape into a square and loosely wrap with plastic wrap (it will expand in the fridge) 
    4.    Allow to dough to rest for about 60-90 minutes in the fridge.
  
*Prepare the Butter:*
  
    1.    On a piece of parchment paper, draw an 8 by 8 inch square.
    2.    Cut the 300g of cold butter into 4 even pieces and place onto the parchment.
    3.    Cover the butter in a second piece of parchment and roll out the butter until it is approximately the size of the square.
    4.    Place back into the fridge until ready to use.
  
*Laminate the Dough (the beurrage):*
  
    1.    Lightly flour the work surface and roll the dough into a 12 by 12 inch square.
    2.    Place the cold butter square in the middle, rotated so it looks like a diamond. 
    3.    Roll the corners of dough out with a rolling pin to thin them out and brush off any excess flour.
    4.    Take one of the flaps and wrap it over the butter. Then take the flap opposite it and wrap it over the butter. Repeat the same process with the other two flaps. It should look like an envelope. 
    5.    First Turn: Roll The dough out until it measures about 9 in by 18-24 inches long. (Make sure to run your hands under the dough occasionally to make sure it's not sticking. Add a small amount of flour if needed)
    6.    Brush the excess flour off the dough.
    7.    Take the right side and fold it over 1/4th of the length of the dough
    8.    Take left side and fold it over to the right and lightly press the seams together 
    9.    Take the right side and fold it over to meet the left side. It should look like a book, that is why it's called a 'book turn'
    10.    Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for 60 minutes. 
    11.    Second Turn: Repeat steps 5-10
    12.    At this point you will have 16 layers or butter and you can stop there, but I like to make it 32 so its extra flaky :) So roll out the dough until it's double its original length, brush off the excess flour and fold it over itself.
    13.    Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and let it chill in the fridge overnight. 
  
*Shaping the Dough:*
  
    1.    Lightly flour your work surface and roll the dough out so that the width is about 9 inches and the length is about24. The dough should be about 1/8 inch thick. Brush of excess flour. 
    2.    Trim the edges so they are straight and form an even rectangle.
    3.    Mark the dough every 4 inches on the bottom. On the top, mark two inches in and then every 4 inches. 
    4.    Cut a diagonal line from the top mark to the bottom mark to form triangles.
    5.    Cut an inch slit into the widest part of the triangle 
    6.    Lightly stretch and elongate the pointed part of the dough.
    7.    Separate where the dough was cut and begin to roll into a tight spiral.
    8.    Place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, making sure that the tail of the dough is tucked under
    9.    Cover the croissants lightly with plastic wrap and lay a tea towel on top for them to proof. Mine take about 15-30 min to proof (depending on the temperature of the kitchen) To check if they are done proofing do the 'poke test'. If you press your finger into the dough and it springs back its not done, if it indents and stays that way it over proofed. If you poke it and it springs back slightly but leaves a slight impression, it is ready for the oven. 
  
*Baking:*
  
    1.    Preheat to 400F for a normal oven and 375F for convection. Be sure to start preheating before your croissants have finished proofing.
    2.    Brush egg wash over the top of the croissants and bake for 20-25 minutes. 
  
**Bon Appetit!**
   
  
*Pro Tips:*
  
    1.    While completing each turn be sure to work quickly so the butter doesn't melt (mainly the concern if it is hot in your kitchen). If it feels like it is melting, let it rest in the fridge for 5 minutes before continuing. If your croissants come out looking more like crescent rolls and dont have those defined layers, then the butter got too warm during the rolling process.
    2.    If you are rolling out the dough and it seems to roll out then retract back, leave it on the counter to rest for a couple minutes (or if it's hot in the kitchen, place it in the fridge) This allows the gluten to relax and will make it easier to roll out when you go back to it.",5895

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup tightly packed basil leaves
* 1/4 cup olive oil, more if needed
* 3 tbsp grated Parmigiano Reggiano\*
* 1 tbsp grated Pecorino Romano\*
* 1 small clove of garlic, roughly chopped

* Pinch of salt
* To serve: 80-100g pasta per person (I used Fusilli Bucati Corti - long shapes such as Spaghetti, Linguini, Bucatini, etc. work well too)

**Instructions**

* Blend the sunflower seeds (if using), basil, garlic and a pinch of salt in a food processor until broken down into small chunks.
* Add in the cheese and olive oil. Start with 1/4 cup of oil and blend - if it's too thick, add more sparingly bit by bit and blend until it reaches desired consistency.
* This pesto can be eaten on toast, omelettes, protein or potatoes - to serve with pasta: cook pasta in heavily salted water according to package instructions until al dente, reserve 1/4-1/2 cup pasta cooking water and drain. Add pesto (around 1.5-2 tbsp per person) to the pasta with a ladleful of the pasta cooking water and mix through until well coated, adding more pasta cooking water if needed.
* Serve topped with a drizzle of olive oil, fresh basil leaves and grated parmesan or pecorino.

7. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Turn the cake out of the pan and cool completely on the rack. Sift confectioners' sugar over the top or serve with your favorite seasonal fruit.

Note: If you notice that there's a bit of excess liquid from either your grated apples or ricotta, go ahead and soak that up or drain it to prevent a runny batter.

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/buffalo-chicken-thighs/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/buffalo-chicken-thighs/)

### INGREDIENTS 

* 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 3 Tbsp butter
* 3 Tbsp hot sauce
* 1/2 tsp paprika (optional)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Preheat oven to 425°F.
* Mix the salt, pepper, and garlic powder (if using) in a small bowl.
* To make the most out of the seasoning, lift the skin and sprinkle the seasoning directly on the meat below the skin. This way, you will flavor the meat and not the outside of the skin. The rest of the spice mixture goes on the skinless part of the thigh. 
* Put the chicken thighs skin down into the cold pan and turn on the burner to medium. 
* Once the skin starts to crackle and pop, cook for about 6 minutes without moving the thighs.
* After 6 minutes, flip the thighs to skin side up. 
* After you flip the thighs skin side up, place the cast iron pan directly on the center rack of the preheated oven and bake for about 30 minutes. 
* Remove the pan and use a digital meat thermometer to make sure the internal temperature reaches at least 160°F at the thickest part (without touching the bone). 

#### Buffalo Hot Sauce

* Melt some butter in a small saucepan, add your favorite hot sauce and paprika (if using), and stir.
* Pour the sauce in a bowl, add the chicken thighs, and toss until every nook and cranny of the thigh is coated with the buttery hot sauce.
* Serve on a plate and spoon some extra sauce all over it. Enjoy!",1640
2021-04-09,49,"Eggplant w/ Garlic Sauce","Addtrack","Hey! I've made this a bunch of times now! It's really good! If you're going to make it, I've got a handful of tips!

I like to add the cornstarch and eggplant into a plastic bag (or tupperware box) and shake it up- quick easy way to coat a bunch at once. Also, if you mix in some white pepper and garlic powder into the cornstarch, good things happen! 

Eggplant is basically a big sponge, and frying them up is time consuming, uses a lot of oil, and gets a ton of grease into the eggplant. I recommend putting them on a cookie sheet or brownie pan, drizzling them with olive oil, and baking them at 400 for 10-20 minutes - They should be pretty squishy when pressed with a finger. It's much, much better to err on the side of TOO much time in the oven, rather than not enough!

The Shaoxing wine is authentic, but you can sub pretty much whatever. I've used sake, sherry, mirin, or even just skipped it all together. If you don't have anything, don't let it stop you from making it!

I like to add a little sugar (or maple syrup) to the sauce. A touch of sweetness really brings everything together.

I like to add ""vegan ground meat crumbles"" into it, but any sort of ground meat pairs really nicely! I fry/brown the ground meat first, then add garlic + chillies + ginger and stuff.",1284

* 2 portions egg noodles of your choice
* 1 head of baby bok choy

* Enoki mushrooms, 50g (optional)
* Cooked corn, ½ cup (optional)
* Sesame oil

**Toppings &amp; garnishes**

* Green onion
* Sesame seeds
* Chilli oil

**Instructions**

Add all broth ingredients to a pot. Bring to a boil on medium heat, reduce heat to low and simmer for around 30 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.

In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients for the wonton filling until well incorporated. Place one heaping teaspoon of filling onto each wonton wrapper, wet the edges slightly with water, fold in half then bring all the edges together and pinch tightly to seal (please check notes for freezing instructions).

Baby bok choy: Wash thoroughly, then remove a small amount of the base whilst keeping the shape intact. Cut in half vertically, then in half again to obtain 4 sections. Blanch in some boiling water for 1-2 minutes until soft, rinse under cold water and drain.

Enoki mushrooms: Rinse only when youre ready to use, otherwise they turn slimy. Cut off the brown, fibrous base and blanch for 1 minute. Rinse under cold water to stop the cooking and separate into 2 portions.

Noodles: Cook according to package instructions (in a pot of boiling water, not in the broth, as it would absorb too much liquid), rise under cold water then place in a serving bowl.

Remove all solid ingredients from the broth, then discard all but the shiitake mushrooms. Slice them thinly. Taste the broth and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.

Cook wontons for 4-5 minutes, or according to package instructions if using store bought. They can be cooked in water or in the broth.

Add the prepared toppings over the cooked noodles (topping quantities per person - 1 shiitake mushroom, around 25g of enoki mushrooms, 5 wontons, ½ head of bok choy, ½ cup of corn) and divide the broth equally between the two portions. Drizzle some sesame oil and top with some green onions and/or other garnishes of choice.

**Notes**

* The number of portions can be easily adjusted by scaling the toppings in the proportions provided. The broth recipe provided serves 2, dont forget to scale accordingly as well!
* For the broth, I just used some water and a veggie stock cube as thats what I had on hand, as well as some frozen, store-bought wontons. Worked like a charm!
* This recipe makes 20 wontons, if not using all of them for this recipe they can also be frozen. Place them on a tray in a single layer and pop into the freezer - once frozen, around 2-3h later, they can be placed into a bag and will keep for around 3 months. To cook, simply place them still frozen in boiling water and cook for around 7-8 minutes.

This warm farro salad with basil is an aromatic and easy dinner recipe, and who doesn't love a filling warm grain salad recipe?

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 40 minutes

Total Time: 50 minutes

Servings: 4

Calories: 319kcal

## Equipment

* Wide skillet
* Medium pot

## Ingredients

* 1 cup pearled farro
* 3 cups water
* 2 teaspoons neutral oil
* 1 tablespoon plant-based butter
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper trimmed and sliced into rounds
* 2 medium zucchini trimmed and sliced into half-moons
* 2 teaspoons olive oil
* 4 ounces basil leaves cut in a chiffonade; a few leaves reserved for garnish
* 6 ounces green olives rinsed if desired
* 5 ounces watercress
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

## Cook the Farro:

* Bring 3 cups of salted water to a boil in a medium pot. Add the farro, reduce heat, and simmer for 25-30 minutes until tender. Drain and rinse.

## Lightly Brown the Onions:

* Heat the oil in a wide skillet over medium heat. Add the butter, and once frothy, add the onions. Cook the onions, often stirring, 8-12 minutes until the onions begin to turn golden brown. They need not be fully caramelized. Season lightly with salt.

## Broil the Zucchini:

* Turn on the broiler. Arrange the zucchini and sliced red Fresno pepper on top of the onions in an even layer. Its okay if there is some overlap! Drizzle with the oil and season with salt and pepper. Transfer the skillet to the broiler and cook, regularly checking, for 3-5 minutes until char marks develop on the zucchini. It may take longer depending on your broiler, but check the zucchini often!

## Finish the Vegetables:

* Transfer the skillet back to the stovetop and turn the heat to medium-high. Allow the zucchini to cook without moving, for an additional 5-6 minutes or until excess water is cooked off and the bottom of the zucchini begins to brown. Dont overcook the zucchini! It should still be bright green in places.
* Add the sliced basil to the skillet along with the olives and watercress and toss to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper and cook for 1-2 minutes until the watercress wilts.

## Finish the Farro Salad:

* Add the cooked farro to the skillet and toss to combine. Taste and season again to your preferences. Turn off the heat and serve warm. Garnish with a few additional basil leaves, if you like.

*makes enough for 2 hungry people*

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients**

"" 12 banana shallots or 2 large onions

"" up to 5 garlic cloves (optional   amount depends on your mood/tastes/what you have)

"" 3 Tbsp salted butter

"" fresh thyme, as much as you like

"" 1 large or 2 small bay leaves (optional   amount depends on your mood/tastes/what you have)

"" 6 Tbsp balsamic vinegar

"" 1-2 Tbsp honey

"" 2 small sheets of store-bought puff pastry, or enough to cover your pan

"" salt

"" pepper

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F and small oven-proof frying pan to medium-high heat. Remove puff pastry from freezer to thaw.
2. Peel and cut the shallots or onions across their middle. If using, peel the cloves of garlic.
3. Add enough butter to the pan to coat its bottom generously, and put in a small handful of thyme and (if using) the bay leaves.
4. Once the herbs start getting fragrant, pour in the balsamic vinegar and honey and give everything a swirl to combine. The more honey you use, the stickier/more caramelized the tart will be.
5. Add the shallots or onions to the pan, cut side up. Pop in the garlic if using. You should have enough liquid in the pan to spoon a bit over the shallots or onions. If not, add a small splash of water and give the pan a gentle swirl to combine the juices. Spoon them over the shallots or onions, then season everything generously with salt and pepper and some more thyme leaves.
6. Flip the shallots or onions so they are now cut-side down. Cover the pan with a lid and reduce heat to medium-low. Youll want to leave the shallots or onions in long enough so that they can soften a bit and absorb the flavours in which they are bathing. This should take about 15 minutes, give or take. Then remove the lid to let the liquid caramelize, turning the heat up if necessary to help the process.
7. While the liquid caramelizes, roll out your puff pastry to ensure it will neatly cover your pan.
8. Once the shallots or onions are ready, place the pastry over the pan, using a wooden spoon to tuck the edges in snugly around the edges.
9. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until the pastry is nicely golden and puffed up. Remove from the oven (be careful! the pan handle is hot!). To do so, cover the pan with an upturned plate, hold the handle with a thick dishcloth or oven mitt, then confidently flip the pie out of the pan and onto the plate. If using bay leaves, remove before serving.
10. Bring to the table and enjoy! To complete the dish, pair with a green salad and garnish the pie with additional thyme leaves, lightly seasoning the top with a bit of flaky salt plus some freshly cracked pepper.

**Notes:** if you want to make enough to feed 4, or two people twice, you may want to use a medium-large pan so as to fit double the amount of ingredients. [Find extra tips and details in the full recipe here](https://www.allo-simone.com/main-dishes/onion-pie/).",2975

2021-04-03,8,"Easy Chinese Boiled Peanuts","assortedeats","Chinese boiled peanuts are basically the same as southern boiled peanuts but with added spice. The result is deliciously soft and tender peanuts that are amazing for snacking.

I love how the instant pot makes this recipe so easy to make! You just throw all the ingredients in. If you don't have a pressure cooker, I've included directions for making it on the stove as well (which is still very simple)!

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb raw, unshelled peanuts (453 grams)
* 2 tbsp salt
* 2 tbsp five spice (or use the whole spices below)

*If Using Whole Spices*

* 3 pieces star anise
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 3 cloves
* 1 tbsp fennel

**Instructions**

* Wash the peanuts to remove any dirt and excess debris.

*For Pressure Cooking:*

* Add the ingredients to the pressure cooker. Add enough water to cover the peanuts. Place a trivet or any other weight on top to ensure that the peanuts are fully submerged.
* Cook on high pressure for 50-60 minutes and quick release once finished.

*Stovetop*

* Optional: soak the peanuts for a few hours beforehand to reduce cooking time.
* Add the peanuts, salt, and five spice to a pot, and add enough water to submerge the peanuts.
* Bring the water to a boil, and boil the peanuts for 3 hours, or 2 hours if pre-soaked.
* To further reduce the cooking time, you can also slightly crack the peanuts open on one end. Then, you would only need to boil the peanuts for about 1 to 1.5 hours.

Store in the refrigerator for up to a week (I recommend storing the peanuts in the salty brine so that they absorb more flavor).

2021-04-01,5,"Marinara Sauce Recipe Using Fresh Tomatoes (Which will soon be planted!)","zestypavlova","Hi all! Sometimes its hard to follow a recipe using fresh tomatoes because you never know how many tomatoes youll have at any given time. My post has a scalable formula to follow [here.](https://www.absolutenom.com/2020/marinara-sauce-recipe-from-scratch/) Happy cooking!

**INGREDIENTS** 

* 600 g peeled and milled\* fresh San Marzano or Roma tomatoes tomatoes, or 23 oz. can of peeled tomatoes. 
* 30 g minced garlic 
* 6 tsp. olive oil 
* 6 g freshly chopped basil 
* 6 g freshly chopped parsley 
* Salt and pepper to taste 
* Knob of butter (optional, but highly recommended.)

**DIRECTIONS** 

1. Prep the tomatoes 
2. Bring a large pot pot of water to a boil. Remove the stems and cut a small x into the base of the tomatoes, just breaking the skin. Carefully place the tomatoes in boiling water for no more than 20 seconds. Remove and place in a bowl. When cool enough to handle, peel the skin away from the flesh of the tomato. It should be pretty easy if you start at the x that you cut in the end. 
3. Crush the tomatoes with your hands, removing any obviously tough stems or left over skin. Empty the tomatoes into a food mill with a medium grade disk and mill until nothing but seeds and dry tissue. 
4. Cook the sauce In a sauce pan or 4 qt. pot, sweat the garlic in the oil on low heat until the garlic is soft and translucent. Do not allow to brown. 
5. Toss in the chopped basil and sauté for 30 seconds before emptying your tomato puree into the pan. 
6. Raise the temperature to medium-high heat and allow the tomato mixture to reduce until it will coat the back of a wooden spoon.\* This can take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes depending on the liquid/fiber ratio of your tomato puree. 
7. Toss in the Parsley just before you serve. Dont cook the parsley in the sauce for more than 10 minutes. It can get bitter. Salt and pepper to taste after the sauce has reduced as much as you want it to. Toss your optional knob of butter in right at the end.\*\*

**NOTES** 

\*The quantity of reduction depends on how much paste your tomatoes produced. My tomatoes are usually fairly fibrous so I dont need to reduce the sauce for too long. I reduced it by about 100 ml. before I got the texture I wanted. 

\*\*Look, I know that butter isnt a traditional part of this sauce. But there are a metric ton of dairy-protein-soluble flavonoids in this thing, and itd be a shame to miss out on this opportunity to release them.

Boiling the sauce should emulsify the oil into the tomato puree. If you notice a ring or residue of oil around the edge of your sauce, get a whisk and stir the hell out of it for a few minutes over heat. Be careful. Splashing hot tomato sauce is like liquid hot magma.",2709

3. Using a small sharp knife, poke holes all over the roast 2-3 inches deep
4. Stuff garlic clove pieces into each hole
5. In a small mixing bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients and seasonings, mix well. It should be a bit paste-like
6. Rub the seasoning mixture all over the roast, coating at least the top and sides.
7. Place the roast in the oven and cook at 500F for the first 20 minutes. Careful that things don't get too smokey
8. Turn the oven down to 325F and cook for 13-14 mins per pound for rare. *Use a meat thermometer* to ensure you're not overcooking. You can always cook it more or heat a given piece to a higher temperature, but it's *way* too nice of a cut to accidentally ruin. I like to pull mine out when the thickest part is at 115F, and let it cook a bit more while resting.
9. Let the roast rest in the pan for 10-15 minutes before carving.
10. Slice into 3/4-inch thick slices, and plate.
11. (Optional) Combine the drippings from the roasting pan with a can of au jus, or salted beef broth and serve that along side the sliced roast. You may also want to add a little worcestershire and soy sauce as well.",1715

### Ingredients

#### Caramel

* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup water

#### Custard

* 3 large eggs
* 14 oz sweetened condensed milk 1 can\*
* 12 oz evaporated milk 1 can
* 2 tsp vanilla extract

### Instructions

#### Caramel

* Preheat the oven to 350F. Add the sugar and water to a saucepan over medium heat. Stir with a spoon just until the sugar dissolves. Once the mixture begins to simmer, twirl the saucepan occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat once the color turns golden.
* Pour the caramel into an 8"" or 9"" round cake pan. Tilt the pan to evenly distribute the caramel over the bottom of the pan. Allow it to cool at room temperature while you prepare the custard.

#### Custard

* Add the eggs, condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla to a blender. Blend on low speed until the mixture is completely smooth. Let it rest for 5 minutes to allow the bubbles that have formed to pop.
* Spoon any remaining bubbles off the top and discard. Place a fine-mesh sieve over the round pan with the caramel, and pour the milk mixture through it into the pan.
* Place the pan into a large roasting pan, and fill it about 1"" with boiling water. Transfer to the oven and bake for 50 minutes  1 hour. The custard will still be slightly jiggly. A toothpick inserted should come out moist without any pieces of custard sticking to it.
* Allow the flan to cool completely to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge for 1-2 hours.
* If the pan feels cold to the touch, let it sit in hot water for 1 minute or until slightly warmed to allow the caramel to loosen easier. Place a large plate over the top of the cake pan. Hold the edges of the plate and pan together firmly with both hands. Flip the flan over and onto the plate. You may need to jiggle the pan slightly to loosen it.

### Notes

\*Note for metric users: condensed milk is measured by weight in the USA rather than volume. While the can is physically smaller, the condensed milk itself is quite heavy. That is why a 14 oz(by weight) can of sweetened condensed milk is smaller than a 12 oz (by volume) can of evaporated milk. ",2219

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, visit:  [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/)

### INGREDIENTS 

* 10 lb pre-cooked ham (approximate weight)
* 4 Tbsp butter
* 1 c brown sugar, packed
* 1/4 c honey
* 1 Tbsp brown mustard
* 1/2 c pineapple juice
* 1/4 c apple juice
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Preheat oven to 325°F.
* Unwrap the ham and place it in a large baking dish. I also decided to pour all the juices from the bag in the dish, to help keep it juicy.
* If you have a spiral-cut ham, theres nothing else to do. Otherwise, make 1/43 deep cuts in a diamond pattern all over the ham surface (this will allow the juices from the brown sugar ham glaze to drip down inside later).
* Place in the oven and bake.
* A ham will take about 1 to 1-1/2 hours to cook through. After 1 hour, check the temperature by inserting a meat thermometer in the thickest part (being careful not to touch the bone). The ham is ready when the internal temperature has reached 130°F.
* At about the 1-hour mark, start making the brown sugar ham glaze.
* Melt butter in a small pan over medium heat. 
* Once the butter has melted, add all the other ingredients and whisk together.
* Bring to a simmer, whisking occasionally, and cook for about 5 minutes. 
* Immediately remove from heat and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes.
* Check the internal temperature of your ham (the ham is finished cooking when it has reached 130°F).
* When its getting close to that point, but has about a half hour left, baste half of the brown sugar ham glaze onto the ham. 
* Fifteen minutes later, brush on the remaining ham glaze and let the ham finish cooking until it has reached 130°F.
* Serve and enjoy!",1803

5. Layer 2-3 tbsps of rice on your hand.
6. Add about a tbsp of any filling on top of it.
7. Cover your filling completely with rice on top (you'll need around 2 tbsp).
8. Press gently with both hands to create a rice ball.
9. Cup one hand to create a point and squeeze the rice ball firmly on three points to create a triangle (refer to video for clarity).
10. Wrap one side of the rice triangle with a sheet of nori.

2021-03-29,75,"Frothy, foamy Turkish coffee","Other_Exercise","This is a really detailed recipe to make sure your Turkish coffee is frothy and foamy, as it's meant to be. 

Here's my more visual, sub 5-minute how-to on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZJHKBH9nS8).

**Equipment:**

Turkish coffee pot (known as a cezve, jezve, or ibrik). Use a copper-plated one, like the one in the link, as it spreads out heat better. 

Espresso cup (make sure its got a saucer, for a optional cube of Turkish delight) 

Teaspoon

Piece of wood for stirring, such as kebab stick, chopstick, or toothpick
Stove/oven top, preferably gas, but electric and induction also works

**Ingredients:** 

* Turkish coffee grounds (or VERY finely ground coffee beans, a level finer than espresso, medium roast. You can use a pestle and mortar to grind your coffee)

* Water

* Optional: Brown or white sugar

* Optional : Turkish delight (My favourite flavours are rose and pistachio, especially pistachio. Ive linked to my favourite flavour of my favourite Turkish delight brand, Koska. Whichever brand of Turkish delight you buy, make sure its actually made in Turkey) 


**Directions:**


&gt;1. **One cup of Turkish coffee = one heaped teaspoon of coffee grounds.** Put a heaped, overflowing teaspoon of Turkish coffee (or just really fine coffee grounds) in the jezve, the Turkish coffee pot. Or, if youre making two cups, you need two teaspoons of coffee, and so on. Why? If you dont use a really heaped teaspoon of coffee, there wont be enough concentration of oils for the crema. Make sure you use fairly fresh coffee  which means coffee grounds that havent been sitting around for more than a month, otherwise those oils will have dried up.



&gt;2. **Toast the coffee.** Put the coffee pot on the very smallest ring on your stovetop. If you dont use the smallest ring, youll waste energy and likely cook your coffee too fast. Turn on to a low to medium heat. Why? Although youve only got coffee grounds in your pot, and no water yet, turning the heat on now for a few seconds helps toast or warm the grounds, which gives off a pleasing aroma and helps develop the flavour. You can also add sugar at this step. Use one teaspoon for mildly sweet coffee, and two teaspoons (or more) for sweet coffee. I personally dont add sugar, because I like the Turkish coffees bitter flavour.


&gt;3. **One cup of Turkish coffee = one espresso cup of water.** Now, youll add the water. The rule is one cup of water for one cup of coffee. Use your espresso cup to measure the right amount of water. Make sure to run the tap first, so youre using fresh water. Why? Fresh water is more likely to be aerated from having just run through the faucet  so this will help your coffee have a more bubbly crema.


&gt;4. **Shallow-stir the Turkish coffee with a piece of wood.** Stir the coffee using a piece of wood. Why? Stirring with a piece of wood apparently avoids damage to the metal of the jezve. I use a kebab stick  but any piece of wood will do, like a toothpick or a chopstick. Using a thin piece of wood also stops too many of the grounds sticking to it, instead of staying in your jezve. To help the coffee grounds dissolve into the water, youll want to stir just the floating grounds of coffee at the top. Dont over-stir the coffee, as this will make the bubbles disappear, meaning your coffee will be less frothy. Many people prefer to hardly stir the coffee at all  giving it only three to six stirs.


&gt;5. **Let the Turkish coffee brew.** I advise a medium low heat, so that you dont cook the coffee too fast. However, any heat will do  but of course, the lower the heat, the longer youll have to wait for your delicious cup of Turkish coffee!


&gt;6. **Keep your eye on the Turkish coffee as it brews**. While a watched pot never boils, an unwatched Turkish coffee pot boils instantly. I cant keep track of the number of times my Turkish coffees boiled over  and remember, if its reached boiling point, youll need to start over again.  Why? Turkish coffee needs to be heated to around 99°C, or 210°F. Any hotter, and itll extremely quickly lose its crema and flavour, and taste ashy. More later on temperature  and knowing when its ready.


&gt;7. **Slowly rotate the jezve, while tapping it with a spoon.** Whats very important not to do is deep-stir the Turkish coffee. Why? This will make all the grounds rise to the top. As you dont filter Turkish coffee, if you stir your coffee at this stage, while its brewing, all the coffee sediment at the bottom will rise to the top  leading to a gritty and unpleasant mouthfeel. But what you do want to do is very gently introduce any remaining undissolved grounds to the water, which will now be hot. To do this, slowly rotate the jezve while its on the stovetop, and tap the outside of the jezve with a teaspoon. 1015 taps of a teaspoon, and three to four gentle rotations of the jezve will do.


&gt;8. **As the bubbles slowly start to rise, prepare to remove the jezve from the heat.** This is the most crucial moment of your Turkish coffee brewing  wait too long, and the coffee will start to boil, which, as mentioned earlier, will ruin the flavour and crema almost instantly. If youve used reasonably fresh coffee thats not been sitting around more than a month, you will see bubbles start to rise, usually around the outer edge. Often, the bubbles will not rise evenly. If you see a part of the crema thats not so well formed, move the jezve to apply more heat to that part. This is a lot easier with a gas stove than electric or induction  but if you dont have a gas stove, you can simply tilt the jezve towards the stove ring on the part that needs a more foamy, developed crema. Remember: stay on the side of caution. A slightly under-brewed Turkish coffee will taste far better than a burned, over-brewed one. When you see the bubbles suddenly speed up, rising up the inside of the jezve, thats a sign you need to take the jezve off the heat, right now


&gt;9. **Pour the coffee into the espresso cup slowly, and never pour from a height.** Why? If you pour from a height, youll disturb your crema, and cause it to dissolve into the coffee. Pour slowly, and in stages. The crema will likely appear on the top of you espresso cup when youre about halfway through pouring. If youve made more than one cup of Turkish coffee, youre going to want to divide the foam democratically  after all, the crema is the bit everyone wants to see! To divide the foam democratically, pour some of the coffee in the first cup, and then some in the second cup, and then repeat until youve poured all the coffee from the jezve to the cups.  One common technique calls for skimming the crema from the jezve with a teaspoon first, and placing that in the espresso cup, and then pouring the coffee, but this isnt necessary if youve taken the time to pour the coffee alternately in each cup.


&gt;10. **Enjoy! And dont drink down to the dregs.** In life, you dont want to scrape the bottom of the barrel. And with Turkish coffee, never drink the bottom few millimetres. Its where the coffee grit, or sediment, lives  and where the grit needs to stay until its time to wash up. Some people like to tell their fortune by looking at the grounds  but I personally prefer to spend my time making ever-better Turkish coffee. 

Now is also the time to eat that optional piece of Turkish delight, which is particularly desirable if youve not added sugar to your coffee  as remember, Turkish coffee is bitter!

3. Make the ribbon: Add brown sugar and cinnamon to a small bowl and throughly combine.
4. Pour half of batter into prepared pan, then evenly sprinkle ribbon mixture on top, then pour the rest of the batter over top of the ribbon mixture, making sure the batter is spread evenly to the edges.
5. Make the topping: Combine brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nuts and salt in a bowl. Add cubed butter and use hands to squeeze everything together until there are no more dry parts left. Youll be able to form large clumps with mixture.
6. Break apart clumps evenly over the cake and bake for about 45 minutes, cool, cut into pieces and enjoy!

### Equipment

* Food processor
* Wide pot

### Ingredients

#### Chicken Meatballs:

* 1 shallot peeled
* 5 cloves garlic peeled
* S cup fresh parsley leaves
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper trimmed, or use crushed red pepper
* ¼ cup heavy cream plus more, if needed
* 2 eggs
* ½ cup breadcrumbs or panko plus more, if needed
* 1 pound ground chicken
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 2 tablespoons avocado oil for frying

#### Calabrian Red Sauce:

* 1 teaspoon olive oil for frying
* 1 yellow onion peeled and minced
* 3 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* ¼ cup Calabrian chili peppers in oil minced
* ¼ cup white wine or chicken stock
* 15 ounce can crushed tomatoes
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Pinch of sugar if needed
* 4 ounces fresh mozzarella torn
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil optional

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Meatballs:

* In a food processor, combine the shallot, garlic, parsley leaves, and chili pepper and pulse until minced. Remove from the processor and rinse out the processor and set aside.
* In a large bowl, whisk together the heavy cream and eggs. Add the panko or breadcrumbs and set aside for 10 minutes.
* Add the minced aromatics to the bowl of softened panko and season with salt and pepper. Add the ground chicken and season with salt and pepper. Use your hands to combine, being careful not to over-mix. If the mixture seems too dry, add a bit more heavy cream and work it in with your hands. If it feels too wet, add a touch more panko. Be careful not to add too much panko, or else you will end up with chicken bricks.
* Form into tablespoon-sized meatballs and set aside. *Note: You can fry up a small piece before making the meatballs to taste them first.*

#### Fry the Meatballs:

* Heat the avocado oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the meatballs in batches, and cook for 3-4 minutes per side until browned all over. Transfer to the meatballs and continue frying until all the meatballs brown all over. Cover the plate with foil and set it aside.

#### Prepare the Sauce:

* If needed, add a touch more oil to the same pan you used to fry the meatballs and turn the heat to medium. Add the diced onion and cook for 5-8 minutes until it softens and turns golden around the edges.
* Add the minced garlic and minced Calabrian peppers and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.
* Pour in the white wine or chicken stock and bring to a boil. Scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan.
* Add the crushed tomatoes and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper and a pinch of sugar, if desired. Add the meatballs, reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes.

#### Melt the Cheese:

* Preheat oven to 400ºF. Arrange the torn mozzarella all over the meatballs and drizzle with 2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil. Transfer to the oven for 15 minutes until the cheese is completely melted. If desired, turn on the broiler for 3-4 minutes until the cheese turns golden brown in spots. Remove from the oven.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the meatballs and sauce between bowls and serve with pasta or crusty bread. Enjoy!

2021-03-25,14,"Vegan Scrambled Eggs","meatballlady","It's a convenience thing.  ""Scrambled eggs"" not only describes the ingredients, but it also conjures a specific idea of what it's supposed to taste like and how it's served.  Most people I know would call this a ""tofu scramble,"" but if you're serving it as a new dish, you'd probably have to say something like, ""tofu scramble, you know, like scrambled eggs"" and this is easier and more concise (although we have had this whole discussion by this point so maybe it isn't easier after all haha).  If someone is trying to make an egg dish vegan, they're not going to search for ""tofu"", they're going to search for ""vegan eggs???"" or ""how to make scrambled eggs vegan,"" to which this is the answer.

I personally think it's weird to call it by a non-vegan name, but it certainly is easy to reference this way.  I don't think people are necessarily trying desperately to recreate animal products so much as animal products are so prevalent that it's easier to just use the pre-existing name for a dish.",998

INGREDIENTS 

* 1 c creamy peanut butter
* 1/2 c + 2 Tbsp powdered sugar
* 2 c chocolate (any kind you like  I like to mix semi-sweet and milk chocolate in a 50/50 mixture)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Place chocolate in a bowl and microwave for 30 seconds, then stir. Continue microwaving in 15-second increments, then stirring, until the chocolate is melted and smooth.
* In a separate bowl, warm up peanut butter in the microwave for 30 seconds. Then stir in the powdered sugar until smooth. It shouldnt be very sticky anymore and you should be able to press it between your fingers and it holds together.
* Using a teaspoon (the one from the silverware drawer), scoop up a bit of the melted chocolate and drip it into the cupcake liners. Using the tip of the spoon, gently nudge it to the edge of the liner, so the entire bottom is covered in a thin layer of chocolate.
* Next, scoop up a small bit of the peanut butter mixture and roll it into a 13 ball. Press the ball flat between the palms of your hands to form a disc.
* Place this disc of peanut butter on top of the chocolate layer in the cupcake pan.
* Finally, using a teaspoon again, scoop up some more of the melted chocolate and drizzle it over top of the peanut butter in a thin layer. Again, using the tip of the spoon, gently nudge it around so that it drips down all sides of the peanut butter.
* Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour to chill.
* Then just remove the cupcake liners and enjoy!",1788

2021-03-23,4,"Latkes","fantasycookery","[Here's the recipe link](https://fantasycookery.com/latkes/)

# Ingredients

* 3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled
* 2 medium yellow onions
* 1 cup matzo meal
* 3 tablespoons potato starch
* 2 eggs, whisked together
* 4 teaspoons Kosher salt
* 2 teaspoons black pepper
* Canola oil, for frying
* Cheese cloth, for removing excess water from the potatoes

# Instructions

**Step 1**

* Using a box grater, shred the potatoes, and place them into a large bowl. Immediately cover the potatoes with cold water  this prevents the shredded potatoes from oxidizing.  Shred the yellow onions using either a box grater or a food processor, and set aside. Next, strain the shredded potatoes and rinse them with more cold water. 
* On a flat surface lay multiple layers of cheesecloth or a thin kitchen towel. Place the strained potatoes in the middle of the cloth, and dump the shredded onions on top. Wrap the cloth into a tight ball  squeeze hard to remove any excess water. This is the most important step. Getting as much moisture as possible out of the potatoes and onions will make for a crispier latke. 
* Next, place the potatoes and onions into a large dry bowl. Add the matzo meal, potato starch,  and whisked eggs  season with salt and pepper. Mix the contents of the bowl either with your hands or a large wooden spoon.

**Step 2**

* Heat at least ½ inch of oil in a heavy bottom pan over medium heat. Test the oil temperature by dropping a small piece of shredded potato into the pot. The oil will sizzle around the potato when its at the correct temperature. 
* Scoop up about a ½ cup of the potato mixture and form the latke in the palm of your hand  gently press the latke with your hands to form a flat top. Using a metal spatula, slowly lower the latkes into the hot oil. Cook the latkes in batches  for about 5 minutes per side. Drain the latkes on a wire rack. Repeat until the remaining latke mix is gone.  Serve with chopped chives or green onions, and top with apple sauce or sour cream.",2004

[Video Recipe](https://youtu.be/rQL0QDc2gBs)

# Ingredients

Serving Size: \~8-10 buns

* 2 tbsp + 2 tsp of warm water
* 1/4 cup of warm milk
* 2 tsp of active dry yeast
* 1 tbsp of sugar
* 1 tbsp of neutral oil
* 1 &amp; 1/4 cup of all purpose flour
* 1/4 tsp of baking powder
* Pinch of salt
* Oil to brush onto bun
* 1/2 can of spam
* 1 tsp of oil
* 1 &amp; 1/2  tbsp of soy sauce
* 1 tbs of mirin
* 1 tbs of sugar
* 1 tbs of sake
* Nori sheets
* 2 stalks of green onions, diced

# Recipe

* In a bowl, combine 1 tbsp of sugar, 2 tsp of active dry yeast, 2 tbsp plus 2 tsp of warm water, 1/4 cup of warm milk, and 1 tbsp of any neutral oil. Give it a little whisk then let the yeast activate for around 10 minutes.
* After 10 minutes, in a stand mixer, combine 1 &amp; 1/4 cup of all purpose flour, 1/4 tsp of baking powder, a pinch of salt, and the wet mixture. Start mixing on low, then when everything is well mixed, turn it up to medium and let it knead for around 10 min.
* Once thats done, cover the mixing bowl with a kitchen towel or food wrap and let it rise in a warm place for at least 2 hours.
* Cut up 1 sheet of nori into 8ths.
* Cut 1/2 a can of spam into thin slices and slice each slice into half
* Combine 1 &amp; 1/2  tbsp of soy sauce, 1 tbsp of mirin, 1 tbsp of sake, and 1 tbsp of sugar. Give it a little mix then set it aside.
* In a medium pan on high, add around 1tsp of oil and the sliced spam and let it cook for around 2-3 minutes. After the spam slices are fried and golden on both sides, add the spam sauce and let it cook until it thickens up, which should take around 2-4 minutes. Once thats done, set it aside.
* After the dough has risen, take it out and place it onto a floured working surface. Then start to roll it out into around 1/4 inch thick. Dont roll it too thin, or else youll lose the fluffy texture. Then use a 3 &amp; 1/2 inch ring mold to cut them into circles. Brush the top of each piece of dough with a little bit of oil. Then fold the piece in half and place it on a piece of parchment paper or cupcake wrapper. Repeat with the rest of the dough and put them back in a warm place to rise again for another half an hour.
* Working in batches, place a few buns into your steamer basket. Do not overcrowd them, as they will expand when cooked. Then place the steamer on a pan or wok filled with around 2 inches of hot water. Turn the heat on medium and let it steam for 10 minutes. Make sure to pay attention to the water level. If it gets too low, fill it back up with more hot water, otherwise your steamer will be scorched.
* After 10 minutes, take it out and let it cool for another 10 minutes.
* Once the waiting is over, take it out, remove the parchment paper from the bottom, then add a piece of cut-up nori along with a slice or 2 of spam and a couple sprinkle of diced green onions. And there you have it!",2899

**Directions:**

1. Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk. Then mix the salt, sugar, flour, and milk together. Make sure there is no dry ingredients left in the bowl. Cover the dough and let it rest for 20 min.
2. Mix 2 tbsps peanut butter with 1 tbsp sesame oil. If you don't want the sesame flavor, feel free to just use the peanut butter.
3. Knead the dough for 3-5 min until it is nice and smooth. Divide the dough into 8 pieces.
4. Take one piece and flatten the dough with the rolling pin. Brush on the peanut butter sesame sauce evenly. Sprinkle some roasted sesame seeds on the dough.
5. Roll the dough up and seal the seam. Cut it into two strands but make sure the top is still connected.
6. Braiding a two-strand bun is very easy, right goes left, left goes right, repeat and keep crossing them.
7. Pinch the end together and roll it up from the end. Place the buns into a steamer and let them proof for about 1 hour in a warm environment ideally between 80 to 90oF.
8. After 1 hour, turn on the stove and use medium to high heat to boil the water in order to generate the steam. After several minutes, you will see the steam come out which means the water has reached the boiling point. Set your timer for 12 minutes.
9. When the time is up, turn off the stove, but remember to leave the steamer closed for another 5 min. Do not open the steamer, otherwise the buns will shrink due to the sudden change of the temperature.

### Ingredients

#### For the Cake

* 3 ripe bananas mashed
* 1/4 cup plain greek yogurt 
* 1/3 cup applesauce 
* 1/4 cup butter unsalted, softened 
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup sugar granulated
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 1/3 cup cocoa powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 cup chocolate chunks

#### For the Ganache

* 2 cups chocolate chunks
* 1 cup half and half (10% cream)

### Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 350F. In a large mixing bowl, mash the bananas with a fork. Add the rest of the cake ingredients and mix well.
* Pour the batter into a very well greased bundt pan. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until you can insert a toothpick and it comes out clean. Cool the cake for 10-15 minutes in the pan, and then transfer to a plate or cooling rack.
* While the cake it cooling, microwave the half and half cream for 1-2 minutes, or until it's very hot. Pour it over the chocolate chunks and wait 5 minutes. Stir the mixture well until the chocolate is fully incorporated. Wait until the cake is cool enough to touch, and then drizzle the ganache over the entire cake. Wait 15 minutes until the ganache sets, and enjoy!

### Notes

I used chocolate chunks to get bigger areas of chocolate in the cake. You can use chocolate chips, or any type of chocolate that is most convenient for you. Applesauce is a great replacement for oils or fats in a recipe. To cut down on some calories, you can use extra applesauce and eliminate the butter. The ganache recipe I have here is much more thick than youd usually make. This is because I wanted a nice thick frosting-like layer on the cake.",1824

2021-03-21,87,"Homemade Moroccan Beghrir Pancakes, 1000 Hole Crepes","Tangerinedubled","I'll answer things one paragraph at a time. 
You sound algerian, and this is obviously an algerian rethorique so I'll answer accordingly. 
1)Tagines are purely moroccans. Algeria produces 0 tagines and has NO CLAY craft whatsoever. The only artisans there working the craft were moroccans. Or simply imported products. Couscous is the semolina, it's an ingredient. In morocco we call the whole dish couscous (with vegetables; fish, meats and whatnot...) the algerian one shares nothing but the semolina. YouTube democratized moroccan dishes, but moroccan families and algerian ones lived together in Morocco during the french occupation before the algerians returning to algeria after the independence, inevitably taking a lot of dishes with them. A cuisine, local or regional, is based on local produce and ingredients : saffron, olive oil, prunes, sesame seeds, lemons, almonds etc. Algeria produces NONE OF THAT. Not even on a smaller scale. It produces some potatoes, always on the verge of a crisis, no milk, and an epsilon quantity of wheat. How can one's traditional dishes be based on the very ingredients they do not produce ??? Baffling.... truly. 

2) Berbers is a big ethnic group, stretching all over africa in places you wouldn't even guess. The geography is a very important component of local foods. Putting 2 and 2 together: not all berber tribes share the same foods, clothes, and even dialects. Beghrir is non existant in Algeria again, it was a moroccan introduction. I'm talking about Moroccan baghrir, not the ottoman version of kadaif that look like baghrir, and are available throughout the empire, from sham to algeria, under different names and shapes. 

3) You were not ""occupied"" by the ottomans, you ""were"" ottomans, you still carry ottoman names, and ottoman traits. And then ""French"" for the best part of 500 years, and moroccans under the Murabitin for centuries before that (they influenced the food scene, and architecture as well, as can be seen in Tlemcen in the grand mosque for example). It frankly is comically ludacris to even suggest that being under multiple empires for centuries does not modify 180° the food scene in a nation ,the middle easterners of Sham lived under the same occupation for less time than algeria did, and they share the exact same dishes as you. The only difference is, you have Morocco next to you, and they don't. So you added some moroccan dishes to your repertoire at a later date. Tunisians have their own dishes, they do not negate their identity and have had the time (independence) to develop their own dishes away from the occupation of the ottomans and the French, dishes like Nouasser come to my mind. Uniquely tunisian, based on local ingredients and practices. Algeria does not have that... for obvious reasons. 
In morocco, france, india, Japan, china, it has always been the ruling class that brought forward flagship dishes to the rest of the country. Either by developing existing recipes or creating new ones. Because they have the cooks and ingredients readily available for trial and errors. It later bled unto the rest of the people starting with imperial cities and then smaller ones. That, is the case in Morocco, we know our history and have ridiculously old books talking about the culinary history of Morocco, and mentioning specific recipes and their origins; how they reached al andalus and other countries, before they were even a thing there. (Same thing for clothing). 
Moroccans are very proud of their cuisine, so are tunisians, because we worked on it. Algerians are not  somehow, but who am I to judge?

4) lol No we do not eat baklava, the first time I tried it personally was when i visited Turkey. It is not a Moroccan recipe, nor a moroccan dish, we do not make it for occasions or festivities, it is something we can buy from middle eastern bakeries made by Syrians or palestinians in Casablanca, but it is fairly new, 5 to 7 years, since the middle eastern diaspora started coming here for refuge... like sushi or indian cuisine.... just because we can buy it or replicate it doesn't make it ours... you will not find it in moroccan bakeries. Unless you ask for it as a special or the owner really likes it. See this is what I meant. You guys should do more research into what constitutes moroccan vs north African vs algerian food. You seem to have it pretty confused.",4375

* Increase the heat on the stove to low-medium and add the egg mixture and lemon zest to the milk, whisking continuously. After a few minutes, the crema pasticcera will thicken up to a thick custard-like consistency.
* Remove from heat, place in a bowl, and let cool on the counter for a few minutes.
* Once the bowl is cool enough to handle, cover it with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic touches the cream. This will prevent it from forming a crust. Place in the refrigerator to cool further.

#### Choux Pastry Dough

* Preheat oven to 400°F.
* In a pot over medium heat, bring butter, sugar, and water to a rolling boil.
* Next, add all of the flour at once and vigorously stir until it forms a ball.
* Remove pot from the heat and add eggs one at a time then stirring until each egg is thoroughly incorporated. By the third or fourth egg, you may want to switch to a whisk. Whisk until it reaches a consistency like a thick icing (not like a bread dough at all!).
* Let cool a few minutes.
* Prepare a baking sheet lined with either a silicone mat or parchment paper.
* Place pastry dough in a piping bag with a star tip (or a Ziplok bag with a small piece of corner cut off).
* Pipe dough into circles measuring about 4 inches in diameter, working from the inside out, then make a second layer on top of the first, but leave a hole in the center of the second layer (this is where the pastry cream will be added later). Make sure to leave a few inches between each one, as they will puff up a bit while baking.
* Bake for 30 minutes or until the dough turns a light golden brown. When lightly pressed with a finger, the zeppole will have slightly spongy feel, like a doughnut.
* Let cool on the counter.

#### Putting It All Together

* Once the zeppole have cooled, remove the crema pasticcera from the fridge and place in a piping bag with a star tip (or a Ziplok bag with a small piece of corner cut off).
* Pipe the cream into the center of each zeppole and continue around, making a circle of cream, then back to the middle for a tall center.
* Lightly dust with powdered sugar and top with a cherry.",3498

2021-03-18,23,"Cauliflower &amp; Citrus salad","fuzzician","CAULIFLOWER &amp; CITRUS SALAD RECIPE

**Ingredients**

"" ¼ of a large cauliflower (about ½ of a small one)

"" 1 grapefruit

"" 1 orange

"" 1 shallot

"" ½ lime

"" 1 - 3 tsps honey

"" ½ pomegranate, for the seeds

"" fresh mint (a few small leaves)

"" red chili flakes

"" poppy seeds

"" olive oil

"" salt

"" pepper

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions**

*For the cauliflower:*

1. Cut straight down through the centre of your cauliflower, then cut again so as to get a steak-like slice roughly 1cm (a bit less than half an inch) in thickness  repeat twice to get 3 slices total.
2. Remove the stem from each steak and separate the florets, allowing for chunks of varying sizes.
3. In a large frying pan on medium-high heat, add a small amount of olive oil, then rub in each piece of cauliflower one by one so as to thinly coat them with the oil. Sprinkle with some salt and pepper, let cook without disturbing until golden (but not brown), then flip and season again, leaving the florets alone to cook until golden on their other side. Thisll take approximately 5-6 minutes per side.
4. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the cauliflower to rest until youre ready to assemble the salad.

*For the citrus:*

1. Cut a tiny bit off the top and bottom of the orange, then use a knife to carefully cut off its peel and pith. Do not discard the peels. Once your orange is naked, you may cut it across its width into slices about as thick as the cauliflower slices.
2. Repeat with the grapefruit.

*For the dressing:*

1. Slice the shallot across its width as thinly as you can.
2. Transfer it to a mug or small bowl, then squeeze over it the juice of your ½ lime plus whatever juice you can squeeze out of your orange and grapefruit scraps. Sprinkle in some salt and give everything a stir, allowing the acid and salt to mellow the shallot a bit.
3. Add in 1 to 3 teaspoons of honey, depending on how sour or sweet youd like things to be, and as much freshly cracked pepper as youd like.
4. Pour in approximately 2 teaspoons to 1 Tablespoon of olive oil (again, this depends on how much you like acidity  use less if you like things a bit sharp, more if you prefer things a bit rounded). Stir, loosening rings of shallot as you go, and set aside.

*For the assembly:*

1. Layer the citrus slices and cauliflower slices however you please on a plate, then pour on enough of the lime dressing (with the shallot rings) to coat generously coat everything.
2. Top with pomegranate seeds, poppy seeds, red chili flakes, fresh mint leaves and salt and pepper.
3. Enjoy!

* ½ cup fresh parsley loosely packed
* ½ cup fresh dill
* 2 tablespoons brine from Castelvetrano olives

### Instructions

#### Cook the Onion and Carrots:

* Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 6-8 minutes until it begins to soften and turn golden brown.
* Add the carrots and cook an additional 7-8 minutes until they begin to soften. Season lightly with salt and pepper.

Prep: 5 minutes   Cook: 15 minutes   Total time: 20 minutes

### INGREDIENTS 

* 8 oz linguine (or spaghetti)
* 1/2 lb asparagus, cleaned, trimmed, and cut into 2 pieces
* 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 1 Tbsp chopped garlic
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1/2 tsp lemon zest
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
* 6 oz feta cheese, crumbled or chopped
* 1/4 c reserved pasta water
* 2 Tbsp chopped flat-leaf Italian parsley (optional)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Start with bringing a pot of water to a boil. Add enough salt to make it taste like the sea. 
* Add the pasta, adjust the heat, and keep it at a rolling boil. Stir a couple of times after a few minutes. This will prevent the pasta from sticking together. 
* While your pasta is cooking, heat 2 Tbsp of your favorite extra-virgin olive oil over medium heat.
* Add the asparagus, 1/4 tsp kosher salt, and 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper. Stir occasionally. 
* Depending on the thickness of the asparagus spears, the amount of heat youre using, and how soft you prefer your asparagus, this step takes between 5 to 10 minutes. My asparagus spears were on the thinner side and I like them al dente, so they were finished after just 5 minutes. Start tasting after about 5 minutes and youll be able to tell when theyre done to your liking.
* A minute before the asparagus are done, add 1 Tbsp of chopped garlic, 1 tsp dried thyme, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp lemon zest, and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Reduce the heat and give it a good stir before adding the feta cheese and the cooked pasta. 
* In the meantime, the pasta should be ready. Before draining the pasta, save about 1/4 cup of pasta water. This will be part of the sauce (together with the melted feta cheese).
* Add crumbled/chopped feta cheese into the pan, reduce heat to just warm enough to melt the cheese, and give it a couple of minutes.
* Then, add the drained pasta and reserved pasta water.
* The melted cheese and pasta water will emulsify and  while occasionally gently stirring  coat the linguine.
* Serve with a sprinkle of chopped parsley on top and enjoy!",2392
2021-03-17,4,"Nutella Oreo Chocolate Cake","akhilsharma6","**Ingredients:**

1. 30-40 Oreo biscuits

2. Nutella spread

3. 3 Tbsp powdered sugar

4. 2 tsp baking powder

5. One tsp baking soda

6. 200-300 ml of raw milk

7. 2 tsp ghee (clarified butter) to grease the cake pan

8. Melted dark chocolate or Cadbury Dairymilk (for topping/decoration)

9. 50 Gms of choco chips (for decoration)

10. One or 2 Cadbury Gems packets (for decoration)

11. 6-8 Kit-Kat wafers (for decoration)

12. Butter paper over which we bake the cake

&amp;#x200B;

**Preparation:**

1. Preheat the oven to 300F and adjust the oven rack to center.

2. To blend the Oreo biscuits, crush them (about 20-25 of them) and grind them in a mixer to a fine powder.

3. Take the powdered biscuits in a medium-sized bowl. Add powdered sugar and mix it well. You can skip adding sugar if you dont want extra sweetness apart from the biscuits.

4. Also add baking powder and baking soda to the mixture and blend it well.

5. Start adding raw milk to the mixture in little quantities so that you can get a thick and flowing liquid consistency. The cake batter is ready now.

6. Grease the cake tin/plate with ghee and place the butter paper over it. You can grease the butter paper as well with a little ghee.

7. Pour the prepared cake batter into the tin evenly. Tap the tin to release any air bubbles within the batter.

8. Place the tin in the oven and bake the cake for about 25-30 minutes. An alternate if you dont have an oven at your disposal, is a kadhai or a cooker. The steps are as follows:

9. Take about 200gms of salt in a kadhai/cooker and place a small rack or a stand over it.

10. Heat the contents covered in a medium flame for about 10-15 minutes. 

11. Remove the lid and place the cake tin with the batter on the stand.

12. Close it with the lid and heat it for about 25-30 minutes.

13. We are basically creating the same heat as in the oven using a kadhai/cooker to bake the cake.

14. Remove the baked cake and insert a toothpick to check if it comes out clean. If it does, your oreo cake is ready. If not, you can re-heat it for another 5 to 10 minutes and remove the cake.

15. Cool it down completely, tilt the tin upside down onto another plate and remove the cake. Remove the butter paper from the top of the cake.

The yummy Nutella Oreo cake is ready. Spread a generous layer of nutella over the cake, using a spatula. That becomes the topping. Also, pour the melted chocolate in parts over the spread to make it tastier and aesthetically appealing. Sprinkle choco chips over the nutella spread and make it more decorative and yummy. You could also use gems and kit-kat wafers for garnishing and place them on the cake to make it more inviting. 

Use the remaining *Oreo* biscuits also to decorate the cake. Place them on the periphery of the cake and one or 2 biscuits inserted over the topping as well.

2021-03-15,52,"Ultimate Traditional Sichuan Dan Dan Noodles","cookingwithRobin","Dan Dan noodles is a world-famous Sichuan dish. It originated in 1841 and consists of a spicy sauce mixed with minced pork, preserved vegetables, sesame paste, and scallions served over skinny noodles.

Have you ever wondered what Dan Dan means? It sounds cute, but this name actually refers to a type of carrying pole that was used by vendors who sell food on the street. Some decades ago, street food vendors in the Chinese province of Sichuan carried the pole over the shoulder, with two baskets, one containing noodles and the other containing sauce attached at either end. In this way, they could lower the cost and make the food very affordable. In Chinese, this pole is called Bian Dan (AÅ), so the local people gradually came to call them Dan Dan noodles.

Pork:

\- 200g 70-80% lean ground pork

\- 100g preserved vegetables (Yibin ya cai)

\- 2 tbsps (30ml) Chinese cooking wine

\- 1 tbsp (15ml) soy sauce

\- 2 tsps (10ml) dark soy sauce

Noodles:

\- 200g all-purpose flour

\- 2g salt

\- 80-85ml water

Sauce:

\- 1 tsp black vinegar

\- 1 tsp soy sauce

\- 2 tsps chili oil

\- 1g sugar

\- 1 tsp sesame sauce (sesame paste &amp; sesame oil in 1:1 ratio)

\- a pinch of Sichuan peppercorn powder (optional)

\- chopped green onions

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

Meat and Veggies:

1. Use medium to high heat, wait for the pan to become hot, add 2 tbsps oil, stir fry the pork until the color turns white.
2. Add 2 tbsps of Chinese cooking wine, stir fry the pork until the water evaporates. Add the preserved vegetables and stir fry everything together for about 1 min. Add 1 tbsp of soy sauce and 2 tsps (10ml) of dark soy sauce, keep stir frying it until there is no more liquid in the pan.
3. Chop the scallions and make the sesame sauce (sesame paste &amp; sesame oil in 1:1 ratio).

Noodles:

1. Dandan noodles are deliberately a little chewy, so the ratio of the flour and water is about 1 : 0.4.
2. Mix the flour, salt, and water together, make sure there is no dry ingredients left in the bowl. Cover it and let it rest for 20 min.
3. Divide the dough into three pieces, take one piece, press down on the dough to roughly flatten it. I then used a manual pasta maker to make the skinny noodles. Run the dough through the pasta maker starting from the thickest setting. Adjust the knob on the side and make the dough thinner and thinner until the setting is at number 5. Dust some flour on top of the dough, so when you cut the dough into noodles, they won't stick together.
4. Boil the noodles for 1 min.

Assembling the bowl:

1. Add the black vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame sauce, a pinch of sugar, and a pinch of Sichuan peppercorn powder in the bowl.
2. Add 1 oz of the noodle soup along with the noodles. Add the cooked meat and scallions. Mix well and slurp it up!",2941

### INGREDIENTS 

#### Ingredients for Chocolate Cheesecake

* 24 oz Philadelphia cream cheese, softened to room temp
* 1 c granulated sugar
* 10 oz bittersweet chocolate
* 1/4 c cocoa
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 4 extra-large eggs, at room temperature
* 1-1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 c heavy cream, at room temperature

#### Ingredients for Oreo Crust

* 1 package (1-lb 4-oz) Mint Oreo cookie wafers
* 6 Tbsp butter

#### Ingredients for Mint Topping

* Cream filling from package of Mint Oreos
* 1 c heavy cream
* 1-1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 c granulated sugar

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Cheesecake Crust

* Preheat oven to 325	
* Separate cream filling from cookie, for the entire package of Mint Oreos, and put in two separate bowls. Place all cookie wafers into a food processor and blend until fine crumbs&or roll them with a rolling pin. 
* Melt 6 Tbsp of butter. In a bowl, pour melted butter over cookie crumbs, and mix together using a fork until the cookies and butter stick together a bit.
* Grease the bottom and sides of a springform pan with butter and press the crust mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove crust from oven and let cool.

#### Cheesecake Batter

* Melt the chocolate. You can either do this in a bowl in the microwave at 15-second increments or melt it over a double boiler. 
* Using a hand mixer or stand mixer, cream the cream cheese until smooth. 
* Add sugar, salt, and cocoa, and mix again.
* Then, add the heavy cream and vanilla and mix until the batter is smooth.
* Next, with the mixer turning, add the eggs one at a time, letting each incorporate into the batter before adding the next one. 
* Finally, add the melted chocolate and mix one final time until all ingredients are incorporated into the batter and the color is consistent throughout.
* Pour the batter into the crust and smooth the top so its level.
* Bake at 325	 for 1 hour or until theres just a little jiggle left in the center when you shake it slightly.
* When the cheesecake has finished baking, turn off the oven but leave the cheesecake in there for another hour before placing it in the fridge. 

#### Mint Topping

* Again, using your mixer, whisk together heavy cream, sugar, vanilla, and cream filling from all Mint Oreos, and mix until firm peaks.

#### Putting It All Together

* Place your finished mint chocolate cheesecake in the fridge and allow to set and firm up for several hours or overnight.
* Once the cheesecake has cooled in the fridge, remove the ring from the springform pan and spread the mint topping over the entire top of the cake. 
* Drizzle with melted chocolate and top with a few dollops of whipped cream.
* Garnish with mint leaves before serving.",2938

2021-03-12,10,"Guinness Beef Stew With Mustard Cream Sauce","fantasycookery","[Here's the recipe link](https://fantasycookery.com/guinness-beef-stew-with-mustard-cream-sauce/)

**Stew Ingredients**

* 2 bottles Guinness extra stout (11.2 fl oz)
* 3 cups low sodium chicken stock
* 3 packets unflavored gelatin
* 2 pounds chuck roast, cut into large steaks
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 2 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced (1 and ½ pounds)
* 3 large carrots (1 pound), peeled and cut at an angle into large 1  2 inch pieces
* 2 medium Russet potatoes, peeled and cut into large 1 -2 inch pieces
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 3 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* Kosher salt and black pepper
* 1 [bouquet garni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouquet_garni) (bundle the following herbs in a cheesecloth and tie with kitchen string; 1 bay leaf, 2 whole sprigs of thyme, and a small bunch of flat-leaf parsley)
* ¼ cup chopped flat-leaf parsley 

**Mustard Cream Sauce**

* 1 cup sour cream
* 4 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
* 1 teaspoon lemon zest
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice

**Instructions**

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour all of the chicken broth into a medium-sized bowl, and sprinkle 1 packet of gelatin at a time on top. Allow each packet to absorb the liquid before sprinkling the next packet.
2. In a large Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. In batches, brown each chuck roast steak for about 3 minutes per side. Place the chuck steaks aside on a sheet pan. Add 2 additional tablespoon of olive oil to the Dutch oven and add all of the onions. Season the onions generously with salt and pepper. Using a large wooden spoon, scrape up the brown bits at the bottom of the Dutch oven. Allow the onions to soften and get super brown. If the onions start to stick, add a bit more olive oil and a couple of tablespoons of water. Next, cube the beef into large 2-inch pieces, and toss with 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour.  Add all of the carrots and potatoes to the Dutch oven, and season with salt and pepper  stir everything together. Cook the carrots and potatoes with onions for 5 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and allow to cook for 2 minutes. Pour in the Guinness stout, chicken stock with gelatin, and whole grain mustard. Add the floured and cubed beef to the Dutch oven, and stir together.  Check the seasonings and be generous with the salt and pepper  the potatoes will absorb much of the salt, so make sure not to skimp. Bring the contents of the Dutch oven to a boil. Place the lid on and cook in the oven for 2 hours. 
3.  While the stew cooks make the mustard cream. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the sour cream, mustard, lemon zest, and lemon juice  stir everything together. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the stew is done. 
4.  After 2 hours, remove the stew from the oven; the beef should be tender and easily pulled apart. Stir in ¼ cup parsley and serve the stew into bowls with a large dollop of mustard cream. ",2986

### Ingredients

#### Carrot Cake

* 312 g all-purpose flour 
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt (if using kosher, use 1 tsp)
* 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp ground ginger
* 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves
* 300 g dark brown sugar 
* 100 g granulated sugar 
* 1 cup melted coconut oil, room temperature
* 4 large eggs room temperature
* 1 cup applesauce, unsweetened, room temperature
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
* 260 g carrots, finely shredded (or 4 whole carrots, must shred at home)
* 228g pecans, chopped and toasted, half goes inside the cake, half for decoration

#### Brown Butter Cream Cheese Frosting

* 2 blocks cream cheese, room temperature (16oz)
* 1 stick unsalted butter (115g)
* 568 g powdered sugar, unsifted 
* 1 tbsp heavy cream or milk
* 1 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
* pinch of salt  


### Instructions

* **Toast pecans.** Preheat oven to 400°F. Place pecans on a parchment-lined baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for 7-10 minutes until fragrant, before the pecans get dark. Allow pecans to cool before chopping. Set aside.
* **Brown the butter.** Melt unsalted butter in a saucepan over medium heat until the butter gets a tint of brown, not too dark, about 10 minutes. It will smell nutty and delicious! Pour into a heat-safe bowl, and cover at room temp to solidify.
* **Shred carrots.** Shred whole carrots using a box grater or food processor using the smaller, finer holes. Make sure to shred at home because pre-shredded carrots are generally dried out, and we need the moisture of the freshly shredded carrots for the cake.
* **Preheat oven + prep pans.** Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease three 9"" round cake pans and line with parchment paper. I like to cut circles of parchment to fit snug at the bottom. Grease again over the parchment and on the sides. (If you would like to make this recipe as cupcakes, a loaf, or a bundt, see the Notes section at the bottom.)
* **Mix dry + wet ingredients.** In a large bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, brown sugar, granulated sugar, eggs, apple sauce, and vanilla. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and stir until just combined, avoiding overmixing. Fold in shredded carrots and half the pecans until evenly combined. Pour cake batter into the 3 baking pans, ensuring they weigh approximately the same (I highly recommend a digital scale).
* **Bake.** Bake the cakes for 20-24 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean. If the toothpick comes out wet, continue baking until cooked thoroughly, but be careful of overbaking. When done, invert the cakes out of their pans onto a cooling rack. Peel off the parchment paper to allow steam to escape faster. Cool the cakes completely before frosting. I like to make the cakes the day before and keep them in the fridge overnight so that it's easier to frost!
* **Make the frosting.** Using a hand mixer or stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat together the solidified brown butter and cream cheese until smooth but not whipped. Add powdered sugar, vanilla, milk, and salt. Beat on low speed until the powdered sugar is incorporated, then increase speed to medium-high until creamy but not whipped, \~1-2 minutes. Add more powdered sugar if frosting is too thin, more milk if too thick, or another pinch of salt if too sweet. Frosting should be smooth but not runny.
* **Assemble and frost.** Using a long serrated knife, level off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Add a spoonful of frosting to the center of your cake stand or serving plate to keep the cake in place. Place the first layer on the stand and add an even layer of frosting on top. Spread to cover the entire top surface. Repeat with the second and third layer. Spread remaining frosting over the sides of the cake. Decorate the cake with the rest of the toasted pecans. Refrigerate cake for at least 15-20 minutes to set before cutting. Store in a fridge to enjoy for up to 5 days. Don't leave it out overnight since the frosting has cream cheese in it.",4281
2021-03-12,50,"Easy Homemade Brioche!","MessInTheKitchen"," You can find the recipe and **metric** measurements [here](https://messinthekitchen.com/homemade-brioche-recipe/)!

### Ingredients

* 1/2 cup milk lukewarm
* 1 tbsp active dry yeast
* 3-8\* tbsp sugar use less for a savory brioche or more for a sweet brioche
* 5 large eggs room temperature
* 2 tsp vanilla extract **optional**, use if you're making a sweet brioche
* 4 1/2 cups flour all-purpose
* 1 1/2 tsp salt or to taste
* 1 1/4 cup butter unsalted, softened at room temperature, cut into 6 equal-sized pieces
* simple syrup or egg wash\*\* for a glossy top, see recipe notes for details

\*Metric measurements will be a button in the recipe card on the blog :)\*

### Instructions

#### Day 1

* Whisk the lukewarm milk, yeast, and 1 tsp of the sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer. Let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy. Whisk in the eggs and vanilla extract.
* Mix the salt and remaining sugar into the flour. Add the dry ingredients into the bowl of your stand mixer. Secure the dough hook to the mixer, and mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms.
* Add one piece of butter to the dough. Mix on medium speed until the butter is completely blended into the dough, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Repeat this step until all the butter is completely incorporated into the dough.
* Continue to knead the dough on medium speed for 5-10 minutes, or until it's completely smooth and elastic. The dough will be soft and slightly tacky to the touch. It should pull from the sides of the bowl. It may still stick to the bottom a bit. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and transfer it to the fridge overnight.

#### Day 2

* Remove the bowl from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 3 hours. Flour your work surface and hands well, Remove the dough from the bowl and form it into a ball.
* Split the ball into two equal-sized pieces. Set one of them aside and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Prep two loaf pans by generously buttering the inside, then dusting with flour.

#### Braided loaf

* Roll the dough ball into a long, thin, oval-like shape. Use a knife or a pizza cutter to slice the oval into 3 equal-sized ropes, leaving about 1 inch of dough connecting the ropes at the top.
* Roll the ropes slightly to smooth them out. Starting from the top where the dough is still connected, braid the strands of dough. Once you've reached the end, pinch the ends of the ropes together.
* Gently lift the braid into one of the prepared loaf pans, tucking the inched ends underneath. Loosely cover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and set aside to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size and reaching the top of the loaf pan.

#### Nantaise loaf

* Take the remaining dough ball and portion it into 8 equal-sized pieces. Flatten one of the pieces out, fold the edges into the middle, and pinch them together. Flip the piece over and cup your hand over it. Gently roll to create a perfect ball. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.
* Place the dough balls into the prepared loaf pan, slightly off-set to create a zig-zag pattern. Loosely cover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and set aside to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size and reaching the top of the loaf pan.

#### Bake

* While the loaves are rising, preheat the oven the 325F. Once the dough has risen, transfer the loaf pans to the oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown. \***Optional:** If you are making a savory brioche, brush the tops of the loaves with egg wash before baking.
* For the sweet brioche in the photos: Brush the loaves generously with syrup immediately once you take them out of the oven. Let the loaves cool for 10 minutes, then brush with another layer of syrup. Let the loaves sit for 5 minutes, then gently flip them out of the pan to finish cooling on a rack.

### Notes

\*Use less sugar if you want a savory brioche, and use more sugar if you want a sweet brioche. I used 5 tbsp for my loaves.\*\*Use simple syrup for sweet brioche and egg wash for a savory brioche. 

* **Egg wash:** whisk 2 eggs with 2 tbsp milk to water. After the dough has risen in the loaf pans, before transferring into the oven, gently brush the egg wash over the dough.
* **Simple syrup:** Dissolve 1/2 cup granulated sugar into 1/2 cup hot water. Let the syrup cool in the fridge as the loaves bake. Brush the loaves generously with syrup immediately once you take them out of the oven. Let the loaves cool for 10 minutes, then brush with another layer of syrup.",4545

I was told by a trustworthy and reliable source that you fine folks possess the investigative skills necessary to perhaps help me crack this case. It deals with food  more specifically, a sauce.

I used to frequent a restauramt in North Miami, Flordia, called Here Comes the Sun. It was a hole-in-the-wall healthfood joint owned and operated by one man (who later passed it on to his son when he died). The restaurant was famous in South Florida. One of the menu items they were most famous for was their homemade Sun Sauce. The recipe was kept a secret.

I fell in love with this restaurant and started giving them large amounts of my money (didnt have that much to begin with) in exchange for their delicious food. I became obsessed with the Sun Sauce. I found that I could put it on anything and make it unbelieveably delicious. First I frequented the restaurant, then I started ordering delivery at least once or twice a week for roughly a year.

Eventually I wanted to try and make my own Sun Sauce so I called the restarant and asked the owner what the sauces ingredients were. He clearly had the list memorized and started listing them out. They were (supposedly) as follows:

Silken tofu
Mellow white miso paste
Ground fennel seed
Ground mustard seed
Apple civer vinegar
Apple juice concentrate
White wine

I immediately went out and bought the ingredients. I tried over and over to recreate this sauce. Modulated the recipe countless times and used so many different proportions. Results tasted nothing like the Sun Sauce. Not even remotely similar. Found it odd but shrugged it off andf continued ordering it. For the record  theyd charge roughly $15 for a QUART of this stuff, so it wasnt affordable.

I became friendly with one of their delivery drivers. One day while he was dropping off my food, we struck up a conversation. He commented on how much extra Sun Sauce I always order. I told him how much I adore it. He then said: Ill let you in on a secret, but dont tell the owner Im telling you this  the Sun Sauce is nothing but mayo, mustard and soy sauce. I was concerned. Important detail here  I care about whats in it because I cant consume any animal products. So if there was actual mayo in it, it would be a problem. So I then had two different friends call the restaurant when I knew the owner would be there answering the phone.

I told friend #1 to ask if the sauce is free of animal products (milk, eggs, honey, etc.) and what the ingredients were. The ingredients he gave my friend were the same as the ones he gave me. And also said yes  the sauce is vegan.

I told friend #2 to call and ask the same question, but preface it by explaining that the reason hes asking was because he has severe food allergies and could go into shock and/or die if they consume any animal products. Now my thinking here was this: if Im a restaurant owner and I want to lie about whats in my food, I can easily do so  but I wouldnt risk a lawsuit when food allergies are involved. A lie about one ingredient could land me in court. So restaurent owners are more likely to tell the truth (or at least subtly point in the direction of it) when allergies are concerned. The owner said its free of animal products so he wouldnt have any issues with food allergies.

At this point I didnt know what to believe, but I was so obsessed with this sauce that I sided with the owner thinking that he likelywouldnt bullshit this and be sued or put out of business.

All this was about 9 years ago. About 6 years ago from today, the restaurant closed down permanently. They had shut down temporarily at one point due to countless health code violations  including but not limited to roaches (in mass quanitities), mold, etc. I guess the renovation and improvements costed them more than what they could afford. Wasnt long after this that they finally closed down.

Ive missed this restaurant so much and recently stumbled upon the phone number of their old head chef in a Facebook comment thread. I texted the number and confirmed it was the chef. We chatted and then he informed me that he and the owner had rented out a commissary and were still making the same food for delivery only. I was thrilled. This was my favorite food on the planet and I was so excited that it was still accessible.

Chef gave me owners number. Called owner. Caught up. Placed a delivery order. They were doing so well that all orders had to be placed 24 hours in advance. Got the food, thanked the owner for dropping it off, and enjoyed the same amazing food that Id missed so much. Since then Ive ordered delivery from him at least 10 times.

So I started thinking about the Sun Sauce again. So I texted the chef  not the owner  asking for the ingredients (not the recipe, just whats in it). Every message Id sent him up to this point (and there were many) he responded to promptly. This time he saw the message but never responded. I waited hours then sent one more. He saw it again, and said nothing. Minutes after, I got this exact text from the owner:

????? Hey there, the ingredients in the sauce are (proceeded to repeat the first list I mentioned in the beginning)???

I have to assume that all the question marks imply  why are you asking this, or why do you want to know so badly&

I responded and thanked him for the info. Now what I find strange is that: (1) the chef answered so many of my questions except that one  and the feeling is that he passed the question to the owner as though the question made him nervous. (2) The owner seemed quite vexed by the question with all the excessive borderline-passive-aggressive question marks.

After this, I got online and started digging. Stumbled upon the comment section for this restaurant on Yelp. Amidst close to a hundred comments was one from someone claiming to have waited tables there and concluded her comment with by the way, the Sun Sauce has a ton of mayo in it. It was too coincidental. A totally unrelated delivery driver from the same restaurant told me the same thing years ago.

I know this probably sounds like sheer lunacy but this sauce is important to me. Ive never had anything like it. It even helps me eat healthy because it can make stuff like veggies, grains and other better options taste amazing. I have been using it literally every single day since I got back in touch with this guy.

So, my question is this  how can I find discover the truth? Can any of YOU guys help me with this? I contacted 3 different testing labs. One said they dont do food. The other 2 never got back to me. This is extremely important me so Ill take whatever help I can get. I considered asking the owner point-blank but this dude is old, grumpy and has a short fuse. If I inadvertently piss him off and the sauce is indeed vegan, I run the risk of being cut off from food I love so much that I literally have an emotional attachment to it. This is my dilemma.",7026

Check out my Youtube Channel &amp; Video on this! [https://youtu.be/nScgK89Mf1Y](https://youtu.be/nScgK89Mf1Y)

Recipe (50-100 dumplings)

&amp;#x200B;

* All-Purpose Flour (1300 grams)
* Water (600-650 grams)
* Salt (as needed)
* Canola Oil (a splash)
* Ground Pork Lean (2 pounds)
* Ground Pork Fat (1/2 pound)
* Shrimp (1 pound)
* Dried Shrimp (handful)
* Chinese Celery (handful)
* Ginger (6 thin slices)
* Scallions (2 large)
* Napa Cabbage (1 large head)
* Sesame Oil (2 tbl)

Spices

&amp;#x200B;

* Soy Sauce (1 tbl)
* Premium Soy Sauce (1 tbl)
* Oyster Sauce (1/2 tbl)
* White Pepper (1 tsp)
* Salt (1 tsp)
* Chicken Powder (1 tsp)
* Sugar (small pinch)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Mix flour and salt in a bowl and combine with water in increments. Knead by pushing down and out until it becomes a solid piece. Drizzle some oil on and continue kneading on a surface for 5-8 minutes. Dough should feel stiff and slightly tough.
2. Rest for 30 minutes, then knead again for another 5-8 minutes. Should feel smooth and not sticky at all. Shape into a flat oval, cover with saran wrap and rest for 2-4 hours. It can stay rested for a long time.
3. Soak dried shrimp in hot water for 30 minutes and prepare the rest of the ingredients. Mince aromatics and dice the celery/cabbage. Then mince the dried shrimp as well, but do not throw out the water it was soaking in. For the regular shrimp, clean, smash and dice away.
4. Combine the ground pork &amp; shrimp into a large bowl with the shrimp water and 1/2 cup of regular water. Beat the water into the meat by mixing. Meat should feel very sticky and moist afterwards. Add in the minced aromatics along with spices then continue mixing.
5. Then mix in the celery and cabbage and lightly combine everything together and evenly. Finally drizzle in the sesame oil and do a final mix. Transfer the meat mixture to a smaller bowl if needed. Leave in fridge uncovered until ready to use.
6. Flatten out the dough and cut a piece length-wise. Roll this dough out into a thin rope, dust some flour on top and then cut into small pieces. With each piece, push downwards in the center to create a circle. Use a small rolling pin to roll it out into a flat circle leaving the center slightly thick. ANY DOUGH THAT IS NOT BEING USED MUST BE COVERED TO AVOID DRYING OUT
7. Fill each piece of flat dough with our filling and using your thumb and index fingers, pinch into shape of a dumpling. Watch video for better visual representation.
8. At this point, you can freeze dumplings (ensuring they are not touching, you can bag them together after they're frozen) and these will last in a freezer for a significant amount of time.
9. To cook dumplings, boil for 10-15 minutes and serve with soy sauce, rice vinegar and minced garlic.

60g of sour cream, and this is important, YOUR OWN MADE, from a farm or something, its smoother and has more fat which allows it to turn into butter.

Now you're gonna need a hand mixer, because it will have small chunks in it, so you need to blend it untill it looks like butter, if you take a spoon of it and the gap doesnt close, you did it correctly, if not, you still made tasty ranch dip.

**Yield:** 8-inch (20 cm) round pan

**Ingredients:**

**-- Dough --** 

* 260 g (2 cups) all-purpose flour
* 30 g (2½ tbsp) granulated sugar
* 3 g (½ tsp) table salt
* 3 g (1 tsp) instant yeast
* 1 large egg
* 120 g (½ cup) warm milk
* 28 g (2 tbsp) unsalted butter, room temperature

**-- Custard --** 

* 1 large egg yolk
* 15 g (4 tsp) granulated sugar
* 100 g (¼ cup + 3 tbsp) milk
* 6 g (2 tsp) cornstarch
* 6 g (2 tsp) all-purpose flour
* ½ tsp vanilla extract

**Instructions:** 

**-- Dough --** 

1. Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Add egg and warm milk. Mix until it becomes a dough.
2. Transfer the dough onto a work surface. Lightly flour if you find the dough too sticky to handle. Knead for 2 minutes.
3. Wrap and knead the softened butter into the dough until fully incorporated. Knead for 10 minutes or until it becomes smooth, elastic, and not sticky.
4. Shape into a dough ball. Grease it with some vegetable oil in a large bowl. Cover the bowl and place it in a warm area until the dough is doubled in size (about 1 hour).

**-- Custard --**

1. In a saucepan, whisk together egg, sugar, and milk. Sieve in cornstarch and flour. Whisk again to completely dissolve them.
2. Cook the mixture over low heat and whisk it constantly until thickened.
3. Turn off the heat and whisk in vanilla. Transfer custard into a small bowl. Cover its surface with plastic wrap to prevent a crust from forming. Set aside to cool (refrigerate if you're not using it in the next hour).

**-- Assembly --**

1. Grease an 8-inch (20 cm) round pan with butter or non-stick cooking spray. Line the bottom with parchment paper. 
2. Punch down the dough to release the air inside. Transfer onto a work surface and divide it evenly into 5 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball and set them aside for 15 minutes with a cover. 
3. Using a rolling pin, roll out each piece into an elongated shape (about 25cm long). Press down the dough along the sides with your thumbs to keep it from stretching back.
4. Cut out thin strips of dough along the top 2/5 part of the dough (lengthwise), but keep them intact with the remaining part of the dough. The strips will be dangling if we pick up the whole dough. Spread a thin layer of custard filling over the remaining part.
5. Fold 1/4-inch of the dough from 3 edges over the custard. Then start rolling towards the dough strips from the opposite end to form a log. Repeat with the other 4 pieces to get a total of 5 logs.

2021-03-09,4,"Yaki Udon (Stir-Fried Udon Noodles)","[deleted]","Sharing one of my favorite weekday recipes! This is an easy &amp; delicious one-pan meal loaded with vegetables, mushrooms, and your choice of protein, all coated in an incredibly flavorful sauce that will have you craving for more :')

Yaki Udon translates to fried udon (Yaki meaning fry or grill) in Japanese, which also indicates the type of noodles being used. A similar rendition of this dish is Yakisoba, which is another well-known Japanese noodle dish. 

This dish is also an incredibly popular street food item in Japan that can be often found at festivals (*omatsuri*) across the country, which has also claimed massive popularity at Izakayas (Japanese pubs) around the world. 

I have used shrimp for the recipe, but you can use any choice of protein for this. Some popular additions include chicken, beef, and pork. Vegetarian &amp; vegan options include tofu, extra vegetables, and/or mushrooms. Enjoy everyone!

**\[RECIPE (2 SERVINGS)\]**

**Ingredients:**

* 2 packs (17-oz./500g) udon noodles, fresh or frozen (see notes below)
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil divided, add more if needed
* 1/2 lb shrimp, or your choice of meat, seafood, tofu, or extra vegetables
* 1/2 yellow onion, sliced
* 1 cup cabbage, shredded
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 cup carrot, cut in matchsticks
* 3-4 mushrooms sliced, I used shiitake for this recipe
* 2 green onions chopped, some reserved for garnish
* sesame seeds and green onions, for garnish

**Yaki Udon Sauce**

* 2 tbsp dark soy sauce
* 2 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 1 tbsp honey, or brown sugar
* 2 tbsp water
* 1 tsp Gochugaru or red pepper flakes, optional

**Directions:**

1. Combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
2. To prepare frozen udon noodles, run hot water over them for a few seconds, using a pair of chopsticks to loosen the noodles. Rinse with cold water, drain, and set aside.
3. Heat a wok or a large pan over medium-high heat, add vegetable oil, and the shrimp. Cook for about 2-3 minutes until they turn pink. Remove and set aside.
4. In the same wok, add vegetable oil, onion, and cabbage, and sauté for a few minutes until edges are browned, for about 3-4 minutes. Add garlic, carrot, and mushrooms, and continue to cook for about 1 minute.
5. Add the cooked shrimp, udon noodles, and sauce, and toss them together for about a minute, until the noodles are evenly coated. Add green onions and mix to combine. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onions and enjoy!

**Notes:**

\* Using frozen udon noodles is recommended for this recipe as they store for months in the freezer, and I found that the frozen kind is actually more ideal for stir-fries. Frozen udon noodles often have a nice chewy texture, and less prone to getting mushy and overcooked when stir-frying.

Check out the instructions with [visuals](https://www.wokandkin.com/pandan-waffles-banh-kep/).

**The Waffle You'll Always Crave**

If you ever find me walking past a Vietnamese bakery, theres one thing you can be sure of: Ill be trying to sneak a peak into their waffle station, hoping to catch some fresh Coconut Pandan Waffles being made.

The sad truth is that its almost always empty! Sure, one or two pieces might grace the cooling rack, but they are just that  cool, soggy and beyond repair.

There are some desserts that are made to be enjoyed cold, but Coconut Pandan Waffles definitely arent.

What you want is each waffle to be so crispy that the crunch echos in your ears while still being super moist in the middle.

To achieve that, youve *got* to make them at home.

It wont get any fresher than the ones that come straight out of your waffle maker, and your kitchen will smell absolutely incredible!

When you lift the lid, theyll come out beautiful and golden, then pull apart with a chew that PROMISES a pillowy-soft warm center.

Theres really nothing that beats it. Plus, if you cant eat them right away, let each cool and store in a freezer. Then reheat and enjoy!

**Pandan Leaves VS Extract**

Our family recipe uses pandan extract because its easier and produces a consistent taste every time. All you have to do it buy a bottle from the Asian supermarket and itll last you many recipes to come!

But if you prefer using fresh ingredients, then the leaves will be ideal. To get the flavor from the leaves, just blend it with water until juiced, then strain it through a clean cloth. The green liquid can then be used to flavor any dishes that require pandan.

**Leaf and Extract Differences**

There are some main differences between the two options:

* **The extract is much more potent than the leaf.** Youll get a strong hit of pandan flavor compared to a mild and subtle hint that the leaves produce.
* **The color will be vastly different.** Using the extract gives you a bright green color while the leaves are a muted green.

Regardless of which version you choose to use for this Pandan Waffle recipe, just make sure everything to adjusted to your preferred taste!

**The Recipe**

* Prep Time: 5 minutes
* Cook Time: 35 minutes
* Batter Resting Time: 3 hours (or overnight)
* Total Time: 3 hours 40 minutes
* Servings: 10 waffles

**Equipment**

* Waffle maker

**Ingredients**

* 2 US cup self-raising flour
* 1 US cup sugar (or to taste)
* 1 US cup full cream milk
* 500 g / 1.1 lbs coconut cream
* 2 eggs
* 100 g / 0.22 lbs dry coconut shreds
* 1 tsp pandan extract
* cooking oil (for lightly greasing the waffle maker)

**About the milk**

This recipe uses full cream milk but you can use other variations if that is your perference. Just keep in mind that substituting for a different milk type will alter the taste.

**Coconut Cream VS Coconut Milk**

When shopping for coconut cream at your local Asian supermarket, you may come across coconut milk as well. Keep in mind that they are not the same!

While they both come from coconuts, the milk version is a runny milk-like liquid extracted from the fruit.

The cream, on the other hand, is the thick paste that floats to the top of its milk counterpart and complements richer recipes.

For this Pandan Waffle recipe, make sure to use *coconut cream* so that each bite is packed indulgent with flavor!

**Instructions**

1. Sift the self-raising flour into a large bowl and combine it with the sugar, milk, coconut cream, eggs, pandan extract and dry coconut shreds. Let it rest for a minimum of 3 hours or overnight. **Tip:** Add the dry coconut shreds in *last* so it isn't coated with flour because that will prevent the batter from sticking to it.
2. Heat up your waffle maker, lightly brush on some oil over the heated surface then pour the batter in 3/4 full. Let it cook for 3 minutes or until the rising steam has disappeared. **Note:** Don't fill the whole heated plate with batter because when the top iron closes, any excess batter will ooze out of the sides.
3. Serve fresh as is or with your favorite toppings!

**Recipe FAQs**

**What if I dont have a waffle maker?**

The batter works just like a pancake batter, so you can cook it straight on any lightly greased non-stick pans. But if youre after the classic waffle look, Id suggest getting a silicone mold or tin waffle cake pan and cook using the oven. Otherwise, a grill pan will also give you a semi-waffle look!

**What if I cant find pandan extract?**

Pandan has a unique flavor that isnt found in any other ingredient. However, if you just want to add antother layer of taste, equal amounts of vanilla extract along with some green food coloring will do.

**Can I use shredded fresh coconut?**

You certainly can! I find it easier to buy the dried version, but fresh ones work too.

**Tips For The Crispiest Waffles**

* **Use vegetable oil** **to grease the waffle maker**. Butter will burn after a while, which isnt ideal when you want to leave the batter in longer for that extra crispiness!
* **Make a test piece first.** Every waffle makers temperature will be different. If you find that its either overcooked or still raw inside, adjust the cooking time.
* **Cook them as you eat.** They are *the best* when eaten fresh, so hold off on making any until youre ready to eat them!",5415
2021-03-06,14,"Pad See Ew (Thai Stir-Fried Noodles)","[deleted]","Pad See Ew is easily one of the most iconic dishes in Thai cuisine. This easy stir-fry dish is made with wide rice noodles, chicken, and crisp vegetables coated in a rich, savory sauce that is a pure delight to your tastebuds. These noodles are so quick to make yet incredibly delicious, and one that I make often on a busy day.

It is known for combining the Chinese technique of stir-frying noodles with the taste of Thailand  in which the harmony of the two cuisines has resulted in a beautifully crafted dish that is loved by many to this day.

Signified by its name, Pad See Ew features rice noodles stir-fried in a hot wok to achieve a slightly charred flavor, mixed in with your choice of protein (tofu, chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp), eggs, and chopped Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli).

This dish is especially iconic for its flavorful sauce, which is the perfect balance of savory, sweet, and slightly tangy notes, infused with the chargrilled flavor from the caramelization of the noodles. Enjoy everyone, hope you have a lovely weekend! x

## Equipment

* Wide pot

## Ingredients

## Spicy Tomato Sauce:

* 1 tablespoon avocado oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 4 Roma tomatoes trimmed and quartered
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 Thai chili peppers optional, trimmed and minced

## Chili Oil Almonds

## Instructions

## Start the Tomato Sauce:

* Heat the avocado oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and tomatoes and cook for 7-10 minutes until softened and beginning to char. Season with salt.
* Melt the butter into the tomatoes. Add the minced garlic, Thai chili peppers, and white parts of the scallions and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

## Simmer the Sauce:

* Add the soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and fish sauce. Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Taste and season to your preferences. Reduce heat to just slightly above low and hard simmer, uncovered, for 20-30 minutes. If the sauce reduces too quickly or too much, turn the heat to very low and add a splash of water.

## Prepare the Chili Oil Almonds:

* Combine the chili oil and almonds in a small pot and turn the heat to low. Cook in the oil for 20 minutes until the almonds are golden brown. Turn off the heat and stir in the green parts of the scallions. Season lightly with salt and set aside.

## Cook the Shrimp:

* Add the shrimp the sauce. Cover and cook for 5-6 minutes until just barely cooked through.

## Finish the Udon:

* Toss the udon in with the shrimp and continue tossing to coat until the udon is warmed through.
* Add 2 tablespoons of the chili oil almonds to the udon and toss to coat. Turn off the heat.

## To Serve:

* Divide the udon between bowls. Spoon a teaspoon or two of the almonds on to each dish. Reserve any excess chili oil almonds for another use. Enjoy!

Get full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks at: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/ground-pork-ramen/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/ground-pork-ramen/)

### INGREDIENTS 

* 3 (3-oz packs) ramen (discard seasoning packet)
* 2 Tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 lb ground pork
* 4 stalks celery, chopped (or any other firm vegetable you like)
* 2 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 Tbsp)
* 3 Tbsp oyster sauce
* 3 Tbsp soy sauce
* Hot sauce or chili paste to taste
* 1 c chopped cilantro
* Lime wedges
* Egg (optional)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* While youre chopping your veggies and collecting the other ingredients, cook ramen noodles (without using the seasoning packet). Before you drain them, scoop out about half a cup of the water and set aside. This liquid will become part of the sauce. 
* Drain the noodles and rinse in cold water, so theyll stop cooking. Cooked ramen should be springy but not spongy. 
* Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil over high heat in a sauté pan and brown the ground pork. Use a wooden spoon to break apart any clumps. Do not season the meat with salt and pepper. 
* Cook the pork until its browned or even let it cook until its crisp, your preference. 
* After about 8 minutes, the pork should have nicely browned and can be removed from the pan. 
* Add another tablespoon of vegetable oil to the same pan and sauté the celery and/or any other vegetable youre using for about two minutes.
* Add garlic for another 30 seconds. 
* Add reserved pasta water to the pan and stir in three tablespoons of oyster and soy sauce each. 
* Use a wooden spoon to scrape off the burnt pork bits (the best stuff) from the bottom of the pan. 
* Add the pork back into the pan and then add the noodles.
* Finally, add some heat like hot sauce, chili paste, sriracha, hot pepper flakes, etc, and mix everything well. 
* Sprinkle with some chopped cilantro, garnish with lime wedges, and serve. I love to squeeze some lime juice over everything. It gives the dish a light, refreshing touch that mingles nicely with the spiciness and the umami flavor provided by the oyster and soy sauces. ",2102

* 1 Large Bowl
* 1 Plastic sandwich bag
* 1 Saucepan, pot, or deep skillet

**Prep Time:** 15 minutes 

**Cook Time:** 50 minutes

**Total time:** 1 hour and 5 minutes.

**Ingredients:**

* 1/3 lb Ground Veal
* 1/6 lb Sweet Italian Sausage
* 1/6 lb Hot Italian Sausage
* 1/3 lb Ground Beef (80/20)
* 1 Cup Italian Panko Breadcrumbs
* 1 Egg
* 1 1/2 cups Parmesan &amp; Romano Mix
* 2 Slices Crustless Italian Bread - Soaked in Milk
* 1/2 Cup Yellow Onion - Finely Chopped
* 3 Cloves of garlic - Pulverized or Minced
* 2 Tablespoons FRESH Italian Parsely - Finely Chopped
* 1 teaspoon Garlic Powder
* 1 1/2 teaspoon Salt
* 1 teaspoon Ground Black Pepper
* 1/4 Cup Whole Milk (duel purpose)
* 2 Jars of FRANCESCO RINALDI Marinara Sauce

**NOTE:** You can substitute Ground Pork for the Veal. 

**Directions:**

1. Put the meat into a large mixing bowl. Do not mix it yet.
2. Finely chop onion, add it to the bowl
3. Finely chop parsley, add it to the bowl
4. Add garlic powder, salt, pepper, and breadcrumbs into a sandwich sized ziplock bag. Shake as rigorously as you want, until it is uniform and incorporated. Place next to the bowl.
5. Cut the crust off of 2 slices of italian bread. Place in bowl of milk.
6.  Crack egg into bowl
7. Add Parm/Romano mix into bowl
8. Add dry ingredient mix in baggie to the bowl
9. Crush garlic into a near-paste so it is able to distribute evenly in meat mixture. Add it to the bowl,
10. Add 2 slices of milky bread into the bowl, don't squeeze. (The milk will help the mixture)
11. WASH YOUR HANDS
12. Pour two jars of marinara into your saucy cooking receptacle of your choice. Put it on medium-high. Keep an eye on it. Once it starts to bubble, turn the burner to Lo, and put a lid on it.  
13. Use a spoon to roughly incorporate the mixture. You don't even have to use a spoon, you're going to get your hands dirty anyway.
14. Its time to massage the meat! Shove your hands in the mixture and mutter ""Oh Madone"" as your italian ancestors smile upon you.
15. The technique of mixing meatballs is to get everything uniformly incorporated WITHOUT OVERMIXING. The moment everything feels well distributed, STOP. I like to grab a handful of mixture, and squeeze it until I make a fist and the meat is pushed out through between my fingers. Remember to also pick up the mixture every few grabs and turn it upside down to ensure the bottom gets love too.
16. Take out a plate. Roll meatballs into golf-ball sized ... balls. Place them on the plate.
17. Place balls into simmering marinara. You should have enough marinara so that the balls are mostly covered, if not completely covered. You can spoon some marinara over the naked tops if you want to. Make sure the balls are NOT touching one another.
18. Lid pot and let simmer for 50 minutes. About halfway through I like to flip the balls over in the marinara just for good measure. It just feels right, I don't know.

**To Serve:**

Place meatballs over pasta, into a bun, or just into a bowl! You may enjoy!",3022

### Ingredients

#### Crust

* 1 graham cracker pie crust 9"" preferred

#### Glaze

* 2 eggs
* 130 g granulated sugar \~2/3 cup
* 21 g cornstarch \~3 tbsp
* 6 oz whole milk \~3/4 cup
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1-2 drops red gel food coloring
* 25 g freeze-dried strawberries pulsed into a powder, \~3/4 oz

#### Fresh Strawberry Filling

* 1 lb strawberries sliced into quarters, \~3 cups
* 55 g powdered sugar \~1/4 cup

#### Whipped Topping

* 16 oz cold heavy cream \~2 cups
* 55 g powdered sugar \~1/4 cup
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
* 1 strawberry half for garnish

### Instructions

* Bake crust per package instructions and set aside to cool.
* In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and granulated sugar until incorporated. In a separate bowl, mix 2 tbsp of the milk with cornstarch and stir until smooth. Pour cornstarch mixture into the egg mixture and combine. Warm the remaining milk (1/2 cup + 2 tbsp) and butter over medium heat until steaming, approx 2 minutes (be careful not to bring it to a simmer). Slowly pour the warm milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly, to avoid cooking the eggs.\* Then place the entire mixture into the saucepan on medium heat. Stir constantly until the glaze thickens, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in the red food coloring and powdered freeze-dried strawberries to make that rich, red-pink color!
* Pour the glaze through a fine-mesh strainer into a heat-safe bowl. The strainer ensures a smooth, saucy glaze. Place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the glaze to cover and prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate the glaze until you're ready to assemble the pie! You'll have enough strawberry glaze for about 2 pies, so you will have plenty.
* With a hand mixer or stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat together the heavy cream, confectioner's, sugar, and vanilla until it forms stiff peaks. Be careful not to overbeat it (it will look curdled if it is). Set aside.
* Spoon about half of the strawberry mixture into the pie crust (you will have extra for second pie if you want!). Spread it all over the bottom and up the edges. Layer on the fresh quartered strawberries on top of the glaze. Sprinkle the 55g or 1/4 cup of powdered sugar on top of the strawberries, then add heaping spoonfuls of the whipped cream over the top. Spread the cream topping in a dome shape over the pie and garnish with a strawberry half.",2530

2021-03-03,19,"Mayak Eggs (Korean ""Drug"" Eggs)","[deleted]","Sharing my favorite way to prepare soft-boiled eggs! This easy recipe calls for soft &amp; jammy eggs soaked in a delicious marinade overnight to create a wonderful burst >/ of flavor in every bite.

Mayak Gyeran (È}Ä), which is the Korean name of this dish, translates to drug eggs to signify the addictive taste of these eggs, as its alluring flavor is guaranteed to have you craving for more. :') 

Soy-marinated eggs have always been my weakness, but this recipe, in particular, is hands down one of my favorite banchan (Korean side dishes) to make as it is suitable for any time of the day. 

The beauty of this dish also lies in its versatility, as it can be used as an excellent garnish to heighten the flavors of any dish (rice, noodles, etc.) that you prefer. They also make for an incredible substitute for ramen eggs which contain similar flavor notes. Enjoy everyone! x

**\[RECIPE (2 SERVINGS)\]**

* 6 large eggs, at room temperature
* 1 tbsp white vinegar
* 1 tsp salt

**Marinade**

* 100 ml soy sauce
* 100 ml honey, oligo syrup, corn syrup, or sugar
* 100 ml water
* 1/4 medium onion, diced
* 1 green onion, diced

**Directions:**

2. Add vinegar and salt to a pot of boiling water. Reduce the heat and gently place each egg into the water. Simmer for 6 minutes (or 10 minutes for hard-boiled eggs). Prepare a large bowl of ice water.
3. When the timer goes off, immediately transfer the eggs to the ice water bath. Allow the eggs to cool completely, for at least 5-10 minutes.
4. Gently peel the eggs (detailed tips above) and place them in a container. Pour the marinade on top, cover, and store in the refrigerator overnight, or at least 6 hours.
5. To serve, place the egg over a bed of rice, and garnish with green onions, sesame seeds, dried seaweed flakes, and/or sesame oil to taste. It makes for an excellent garnish over a bowl of noodles as well. Enjoy!

**Notes:**

These marinated eggs will last about 3-4 days in the fridge.

Any leftover marinade can be used for stir-frying vegetables, meats, or noodles. The sauce is very versatile, so you can definitely put it to add flavor to your other dishes.

* 1/2 c chocolate chips or chopped chocolate, melted
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 c Nutella
* Butter or vegetable shortening for greasing the pan

#### Salted Caramel Sauce

* 1/8 c water
* 1/2 c granulated sugar
* 3 Tbsp salted butter
* 1/4 c heavy whipping cream
* Coarse sea salt (like Maldon)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Fudgy Nutella Brownies

* Preheat oven to 350	. 
* Melt chocolate chips by microwaving for 30 seconds, then giving them a stir, then repeat microwaving for 15 seconds, then stirring, a few more times until the chocolate is smooth.
* While the melted chocolate is still warm, stir together the melted chocolate with the Nutella.
* Using a handheld or stand mixer, cream together the butter and both sugars for about three minutes. 
* Add the eggs and vanilla and mix again.
* Next, add the chocolate/Nutella and mix just until smooth.
* In a separate bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Finally, add this to the wet ingredients and again mix just until smooth. The consistency of the batter will be quite thick, but no worries, this is to be expected.
* Using a rubber spatula, spread the batter into a greased 93 x 93 baking pan.
* Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean. Also, give the brownie pan a shake. If theres any jiggle, give them just a few more minutes and then theyll be ready.

#### Salted Caramel Sauce

* Add water to a small pot.
* Very carefully, pour the sugar into the center of the pot. Don't worry if the sugar is slightly higher than the water level, it will get soaked in as it cooks.
* Turn the heat to low-medium. Do not, I repeat do not stir and do not move the pot. 
* The sugar water will begin to bubble rapidly. Just leave it be (be very careful with this bubbling sugar water, its extremely hot and will burn you badly). 
* When it begins to turn a light amber color (this is caramelization!), remove it from the heat.
* Immediately add the butter and stir until melted. 
* Lastly, add the heavy whipping cream and whisk until smooth. Caramel sauce will thicken as it cools.
* Once the brownies are finished and have cooled a little bit, pour over the caramel sauce and sprinkle with coarse sea salt. ",2701

Otherwise below are detailed steps on how to make this dish. I've also included some notes on substitutes and optional ingredients.

**INSTRUCTIONS** 

- Mix marinate ingredients together into a smooth mixture, marinate chicken for 30 mins, set aside.
- Mix sauce ingredients together, set aside.
- Add oil to a wok or large frying pan and heat until it shimmers (about 350f), then fry cashews for about 1 minute until golden brown then remove with a slotted spoon onto some kitchen roll. 
- In the same oil, fry chillies for about 30-45 seconds until just beginning to brown - again remove with slotted spoon and set aside.
- Flour the chicken, then fry it in the same oil for about 3-4mins until cooked through - remove with slotted spoon and set aside.
- Remove all but 1 tbs of oil from your wok, then over med-high heat stir fry garlic and onion for about 1 minute before adding back in your chicken, chillies, cashews.
- Add sauce mixture and stir fry for about 2 mins until sauce has reduced slightly and is forming a glossy coating over everything. 
- Add julienned chillies and spring onions, give everything a good mix to incorporate.

**TO SERVE**

- This dish is best served with fresh jasmine rice. 
- A cold beer is also a good pairing!

**NOTES**

- Dried birdseyes will make this dish very, very hot - they are completely optional but if you like spice I recommend adding them in!
- For the julienned fresh chillies, I use large green and red chillies that are mild in terms of spice (jalapenos / cayenne / arbol would all be decent options) - if you can't find large fresh chillies using just red and green peppers will do
- Rice flour can be used as an alternative to AP flour",3010

Teriyaki chicken (g<MÁ­ó), or chicken teriyaki, is easily one of the most famous Japanese dishes around the world, featuring juicy tender pieces of chicken glazed in a delicious sweet and savory sauce.

The term ""Teriyaki"" is actually used to describe a popular cooking technique in Japanese cuisine in which fish or meat are grilled in a glaze of soy sauce, mirin, and sugar.

This technique results in a dish that's infused with strong flavors without the need for marinating, which makes the cooking process incredibly convenient and easy while creating juicy, flavorful pieces of meat to be served over a bowl of steamed rice, or any way that you prefer. 

Hope you guys enjoy the recipe! x

**\[RECIPE (2 SERVINGS\]**

**Ingredients:**

* 1 lb boneless chicken thighs skin-on or skinless, lightly seasoned with salt
* chopped green onions, sesame seeds, and/or shredded nori for garnish
* 1 tbsp cooking oil

**Teriyaki Sauce**

* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp mirin, sake, or rice vinegar

**Directions:**

1. Lightly season both sides of the chicken with salt.
2. In a small bowl, combine equal parts of soy sauce, sugar, and mirin.
3. Pat the chicken dry of any excess moisture. Lightly oil a skillet over medium heat and cook the chicken (skin side down, if using skin-on), flipping occasionally until both sides are golden and cooked through.
4. Remove the chicken from the skillet, remove any excess oil, and pour in the sauce. Simmer the sauce until slightly thickened, about 1-2 minutes. Add cooked chicken back into the skillet and coat evenly with the sauce. Continue to cook while basting the chicken with the sauce until the chicken is coated in a thick, shiny glaze.
5. Remove from heat, let it rest slightly, and cut into bite-sized pieces, being careful to keep the skin intact. Serve over a bowl of steamed rice and garnish with chopped green onions, sesame seeds, and/or shredded nori. Enjoy!

**Notes:**

Please feel free to double or triple the recipe for more portions, while maintaining the equal parts ratio for the sauce ingredients. This sauce can also be made in advance, stored in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks!

2021-02-26,94,"Tonkotsu Ramen","Clairval","I guess you now know why some restaurants specialise exclusively in industrial quantities of ramen to reduce the cost per serving!

Although ramen is essentially noodles + broth + tare + oil + toppings + (marinated) egg. I'm cheating here because ""ramen"" refers to a specific type of noodles, but for our purpose let's assume the oversimplification. So here's how over the years, I built my noodle-fu upwards while staying lazy and on a budget:

1. Buying instant noodles and cracking an egg in the last minute(s) of the water boiling.
2. Realising that if I instead bought noodles in bulk (even first price spaghetti work) and used half a bouillon cube per serving as broth, I would save a lot of money. Tare can just be 1Tbsp soy sauce for now. The only vaguely involving part is measuring the correct amount of water in advance, since you're throwing your cube in during the cooking of the noodles. In fact, if you're using spaghetti, you could even soft-boil the egg during the cooking of the pasta. (Toppings are really whatever your like. French-cut leftovers are your friends.)
3. Bouillon cubes are too salty and proper broth takes too long to make. Let's make our instant broth! You want to crisp 200g of bacon, absorb the leaky fat with a paper towel, then throw it in a spice grinder, enough salt that it will keep outside the fridge (1Tbsp is fine), 20g or more of dried stinky black mushroom, and 1Tbsp of every dried spice/herb you'd like (ginger, garlic, parsey, etc.). Grind enough and tadah, you have 30 servings of the instant broth powder. Now that you're not using oily cubes any more, you just add 1ts of your favourite oil in each bowl.
4. Tare is essentially ""umami"" stuff and normally fishy stuff (but that doesn't go too well with my partner), so Google the word and see what to throw in each bowl (cheapest is something like 1ts concentrated tomato and 1Tbsp soy sauce).
5. By that point you realise that (assuming you're doing something else during the cooking of the pasta) most the time actually spent per serving is peeling the sodding egg, and, you're \*this\* close from having streamlined the entire process. Also, that egg doesn't taste like fantasy. Time to prepare lotsa marinated eggs in advance at once! Soil-boil 4-12 eggs depending on your household and noodle consumption, throw them immediately in iced water to stop the cooking, peel them when they've cooled down, put them in a far with, per egg, 1Tbsp soy sauce, 1ts strong enough mirin (you don't need vinegar then) and enough water that all the eggs are immersed (the top one will float). Eggs should marinate at least 12 hours in the fridge, but ideally 48. Then won't keep for too long, so don't make too many at a time. Also they need to be at room temprature to acutally taste like something, so if you're eating noddles in the evening, pull them out the fridge after lunch or something. And while most the marinade's favlour is in the eggs now, the remainder can be added to the bowls too.
6. Keeping experimenting and optimising. By this point I'm using a single broth recipe and have 2-3 different specific combos of noodle type + oil type + umami base + toppings that I like, but it's really a personal choice.",3215

### INGREDIENTS 

#### Pasta

* 1 c all-purpose flour
* 1 large egg + 2 yolks
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp extra-virgin olive oil

#### Spinach Ricotta (and Parmesan cheese) Filling

* 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 5 oz fresh spinach, washed and trimmed
* 3/4 c whole milk ricotta
* 1/2 c grated Parmigiano Reggiano
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper

#### Sage Butter Sauce

* 1 stick unsalted butter
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 1/4 c fresh sage leaves, roughly chopped

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Pasta

* Start by sifting the flour onto the surface. 
* Create a well on top of the flour and crack an egg into it. 
* Also, lightly whisk two egg yolks in a small bowl and have them ready. 
* Add the salt into the well and start mixing carefully with a fork, trying to keep the egg from running out of the well. 
* Once the first egg is mostly incorporated into the flour, add the olive oil and the two egg yolks. 
* At this point, I like to use a food scraper to help work the flour toward the center to mix the dough until the egg yolks are mostly absorbed. 
* Next, sprinkle some flour into your hands and knead for about 3 minutes.
* Wrap in cling wrap and let rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes.
* Next, cut the dough into quarters. 
* Flatten each piece of dough slightly by pressing down with the palm of your hand and form it into a rectangular shape that will fit the width of the machine. 
* Set the rollers to the widest setting and roll the dough through. Keep rolling the dough through the pasta maker, passing it through each setting twice. Keep decreasing the setting until reaching your desired thickness. In the case of ravioli, you want to make sure to get to the smallest, thinnest setting, as the dough will be doubled when you fold it over. 

#### Spinach Ricotta (and Parmesan cheese) Filling

* Use a pan thats large enough to fit the fresh spinach.
* Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the spinach.
* Within a couple minutes  while stirring occasionally  your fresh spinach will shrink from a couple handfuls to less than a cup. 
* When the spinach is cooked down, place in a colander and squeeze out as much water as you can. In addition to that, I place the spinach onto some paper towels to remove some more moisture.
* Finely chop the spinach. 
* Place the spinach in a bowl, together with the ricotta, Parmesan, salt, and pepper, and mix it all together.
* Taste and add more salt and/or pepper if necessary. The way your filling tastes right now is pretty much how your ravioli (without sauce) will taste. 

#### How to Make Homemade Ravioli

* Place about 2 tsp of filling on the bottom half of the dough sheet. Leave about 1-1/2 of space between each scoop of filling. 
* Lightly spritz the long edge of the dough with water. This will help the dough to stick to itself when you fold it. 
* Fold the dough in half. 
* Gently press down around each scoop of filling, trying to remove as much air as possible. This will help the ravioli cook more evenly. 
* Next, use a knife or one of those cool ravioli wheels to cut the raviolis.

#### Sage Butter Sauce

* Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low-medium heat. The butter will begin to bubble after a minute or so. 
* Add salt, pepper, and sage and continue stirring and cooking for another 1 to 2 minutes until the butter turns a light brown. Taste it (careful, it will be very hot). It should have a rich, nutty flavor. 

#### Putting it all together

* Cook ravioli in regular salted pasta water, brought to a boil, making sure not to crowd them too much or theyll cook unevenly. As they only take a few minutes to cook, make them in batches if needed. 
* Because these homemade ravioli are pretty delicate when cooked, I recommend using a handy food spider to remove them from the pasta pot instead of draining them in a colander.
* Drizzle sage butter sauce over the ravioli. Serve and enjoy!",4244

### Equipment

* Sauce pan
* Skillet

### Ingredients

* ½ pound large shrimp peeled and deveined
* ½ pound bay scallops preferably wild
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
* 1 shallot peeled and minced
* 5 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 4 tablespoons butter divided

* Crushed red pepper to taste
* Paprika to taste
* 3/4 cup chicken stock
* ½ a lemon juiced and zested
* 10 fresh basil leaves

### Instructions

#### Prepare Scallops:

* Remove the muscle from the bay scallops. Pat the scallops and the shrimp dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Chill until ready to cook.

#### Prepare the Beans:

* In a sauce pan, heat the 1 teaspoon olive oil over medium heat until hot. Add the minced shallot and cook for 3-4 minutes until the shallot begins to soften and turn golden brown. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, another minute or so more.
* Add the butter to the saucepan and once the butter is melted and froth, add the drained beans and toss in the butter. Season with crushed red pepper and a sprinkle of paprika.
* Stir in the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to very low and simmer, uncovered, for about 15-20 minutes.

#### Cook the Shrimp and Scallops:

* Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet over medium high until very hot. Add the shrimp and cook in an even layer for about 1 minute 30 seconds per side. Once cooked through, transfer to a bowl.
* Return the skillet to medium high. If the skillet seems a bit dry, add a bit more butter or olive oil. Add the scallops and cook in an even layer for about 1 minute. Flip and cook an additional 1 minute. Remove from heat immediately.

#### Finish the Beans:

* Stir the lemon juice and half the lemon zest into the pot with the beans and cook for another minute or so. Taste and season the beans accordingly.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the beans between bowls and divide the sliced basil leaves over the beans. Arrange half the bay scallops and half the shrimp on top of each dish. Garnish with the reserved lemon zest. Enjoy!

\- 350g all-purpose flour

\- 50g sugar

\- 4g salt

\- 90ml milk

\- 4g yeast

\- 2 large eggs

\- 2 tbsps melted butter

\- 80g raisins

\- 120g nuts (pistachios, cashews, walnuts)

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/LwV6PlrASoc)

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Dissolve the yeast in warm milk. Mix the flour, salt, and sugar together. Add the milk and mix with the dry ingredients. Add two eggs and mix well.
2. Add 2 tbsps of melted butter and knead the dough to absorb all the butter. Knead the dough until it is smooth.
3. Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour until it doubles in size.
4. Afterwards, transfer to a baking mat so it won't stick. Knead the dough to remove all the air bubbles until the size of the dough is almost the same as before the rise.
5. Flatten the dough with the rolling pin and roll it out into a rectangular shape (size: 14"" x 10"" x 1"").
6. Spread on your favorite nuts and dried fruits. I used pistachios, cashews, walnuts, and raisins. Gently pat them into the dough, so they will not move around.
7. Roll the dough up and seal both ends and the seam. Place it onto a baking sheet, cover it with a cloth or plastic wrapper, and final proof for about 40 min.
8. Score the bread using a sharp knife or a razor. This bread (dalieba) always has a shiny rich golden brown color, so here we need to brush on two thin layers of the egg wash before baking.
9. Bake for 40 minutes in 350^(o)F. 20 minutes into baking, place a baking sheet on top of the bread, so the color will not be too dark.

&amp;#x200B;

The smell of baked walnuts is super delicious, the raisins make the bread sweet. This bread is dense and filling, great for a cold environment. I personally just had a 54-hour power outage because of the winter storm. My house was below the freezing point for three days. During this time, with no electricity, no heat, and no water, I ate a lot of dalieba that was prepared prior to the winter storm :)",2039
2021-02-24,3,"Upside-down Steamed Pork (Originally Hakka, Reinvented in Sichuan) Recipe","VivsYummytown","Kau yuk is a Hakka dish that got very popular all over China. The original version calls for fermented mustard greens. The Sichuanese loved it and gave it a new and ""improved"" version of fermented mustard by using the tender stem at a younger stage of the plant, thus creating a juicier, crunchier texture. Then the Sichuan chefs applied their masterful use of aromatics and spices and gave the dish new layers of flavors with dried chili and Sichuan peppercorn. The pork is wonderfully tender, gelatinous, and addictively savory.

**Equipment**

* Steam pot, with lid and insert (see notes for more information)
* Steaming bowl
* Presentation bowl -- with rim comfortably bigger than the steaming bowl
* Medium size nonstick frying pan

**Ingredients** 

*Pork*

* 1½ lb pork belly

*Marinade*

* 1 tbsp light soy sauce
* ½ tbsp dark soy sauce
* ½ tbsp sugar
* 1 tbsp vodka
* ¼ inch ginger
* ½ tsp rice vinegar
* ½ tsp ground pepper

*Greens*

* 230 g fermented mustard greens (1 pack)
* 1 tbsp cooking oil
* 3 dried chilies
* ½ tsp Sichuan peppercorn

*Miscellaneous*

* water for boiling
* ½ tbsp honey (optional)

**Directions**

*Prep*

* Prepare two bowls  a steaming bowl and a presentation bowl. Its a good idea to practice flipping them (wearing your oven mitts) at this point.
* Mix the marinade and set aside.
* Pre-cook the meat.
* In a covered non-stick pan, dry sear the pork (rind side down) over medium heat until the rind is gold brown with charred spots and blisters.
* Add filtered water to pan until the seared pork is just submerged. Bring water to boil and continue to boil the pork belly for 40 minutes.

*Stir fry the greens*

* Add about 1 tbsp of canola oil to wok over high heat.
* Add first the fermented mustard greens, then the dried chilies and Sichuan peppercorns. Stir constantly for about 1 minute or untill the moisture is visibly reduced.
* Remove from heat and allow to cool.

*Finish the pork*

* When the pork has finished boiling, pat it dry with a paper towel.
* \[Optional\] Brush the rind with honey and return it to a dry pan over medium heat, rind-side down. This will not change the flavor much, but will add color.
* Starting from the rind, slice the pork belly into half-centimeter strips.
* Arrange the pork belly slices in a tight stack and place the rind-side down into the steaming bowl.
* Pour the marinade over the pork belly slices.
* Cover the pork belly with the greens, lightly packing them in around and over the pork, forming a flat surface at the top of the bowl (or as near it as possible).
* Heat a large amount of water to boiling, and add the steaming bowl to the pot. Cover the pot and steam for 2 hours. Check periodically to make sure the water doesn't dry out during steaming.
* When the pork is fully steamed, remove it from the pot. Cover the steaming bowl with the plating bowl and flip the pork belly (as practiced), so the pork belly finishes rind-side up for presentation.

**Notes**

* Traditionally the pork rind is torched till completed blackened, then scrubbed and rinsed, primarily to remove stubborn residual hair. The blistering in the traditional method is done through carefully monitored low temperature frying. Both these steps in the traditional method have higher equipment and skill level requirements, and can be avoided by getting well cleaned pork belly, and using the searing technique mentioned above.
* Once the pork is done boiling (in the nonstick pan), you can choose to brush the rind with honey and sear with oil till blistered. This process helps to better color the rind with an intense red-ish brown shine in the final presentation.
* Esterification is used very often in Chinese cooking to remove the unpleasant gamey or fishy flavors from meats, usually by adding rice wine to the meat during a fully heated stage of cooking. I often get questions about rice wine substitute -- I tend to use vodka as an accessible substitute for rice wine. It works great because the relatively high ABV percentage in vodka helps create ester while the neutral taste wont mess with the taste of the dish. Theoretically any grain-based alcohol with a neutral taste should work as a good substitute for rice wine in Chinese cooking.

2021-02-24,4,"PASTIERA NAPOLETANA (traditional Easter pie in Italy)","Fistul-a","*The link for the video tutorial is available at the end of the recipe.*

**Pastiera Napoletana** is an Easter classic in Italy, its tradition going back in time as it has always been a celebration of springs abundance and renewal. Many Italians today serve it for breakfast on Easter day, the tradition being that you should prepare it no later than Thursday or at least the Friday before Easter to ensure the ingredients have enough time to infuse before the sacred Sunday.

Pastiera Napoletana requires three main preparations:

* a shortcrust pastry (to be prepared one day in advance)
* a cream with pre-cooked wheat (""grano cotto"")
* a mixture of sugar and fresh ricotta.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Shortcrust pastry**

* Butter: 150 g
* Flour: 270 g
* Powdered Almonds: 60 g
* Powdered Sugar: 110 g
* Whole Eggs: 45 g
* Egg Yolks: 48 g
* Vanilla bean: 1
* Grated Lemon Peel: 2g
* Salt: 2 g

Mix the ingredients by placing them in this order: butter and flour, vanilla, salt, lemon, eggs and almonds (alternating) and finally the sugar. The sablé shall be prepared at least one day in advance and put to rest one night in the fridge (+4°C).

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Cream with ""grano-cotto""**

* Pre-coocked wheat (""grano cotto""): 400 g
* Milk: 150 g
* Butter: 30 g
* Peels of one lemon and one orange, cut out large

Place all the ingredients in a saucepan and cook over low heat for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat, remove the peels and store at room temperature.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Mixture of sugar and fresh ricotta**

* Ricotta cheese: 350 g
* Caster sugar: 280 g
* Whole eggs: 250 g
* Egg yolks: 30 g
* Powdered cinnamon: 2 g
* Aroma of orange blossoms: 2 g
* Candied orange and citron in small pieces: 100 g

Whip ricotta, sugar and eggs in a planetary mixer until you reach a homogeneous and uniform mass. Add and mix by hand the cooked wheat cream (that prepared in the previous step), cinnamon, the aroma of orange blossoms and, in the end, add the candied fruit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Preparation**

Line the buttered pan with a 4mm layer of shortcrust pastry. Cut off the excess dough with a knife or rolling pin. Gently pour the cream inside. On top of the cream, you can put thin strips of shortcrust pastry to form regular rhombuses, or you can prepare a shortcrust pastry decoration using a specialized tart mould.

Bake the cake for 40 minutes in the oven at 180 ° C. After about twenty minutes you can open the oven valve (or open the door slightly if you dont have an oven with the valve). Once cooked, put the pastiera to cool.

Wait for it to reach room temperature before removing the pie from the pan. Once it has cooled, you can also sprinkle the top with powdered sugar. According to tradition, the Neapolitan Pastiera should rest at least one day before being eaten.
