**Easy Tiramisu Recipe (no raw eggs!)**

**Ingredients:** 

* About 1.5 packages worth of lady fingers (I got mine at an Italian market, ran out, and then had my husband run out to get more at Whole Foods - he got the store-brand, which is also imported from Italy). Make sure these are the HARD lady fingers, NOT the soft ones!
* 2 C strong coffee/espresso
* 9 Tbsp rum or marsala wine (you can half this for a less pronounced alcoholic flavor; I thought this was just right :)
* 1 C heavy cream
* 1-1.5 lb mascarpone
* 2/3 C sugar, divided
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 2-3 Tbsp cocoa powder
* Handful of chopped chocolate/chocolate shavings (optional)

**Method:** 

1. **Prepare coffee/alcohol for dipping:** Combine coffee in a wide, shallow bowl, and combine with about 5 Tbsp of the rum. Set side.
2. **Prepare mascarpone/cream mixture:** Whip heavy cream with 1/3 C sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 2 Tbsp rum, until you have soft peaks. Then, slowly fold in the mascarpone along with the other 1/3 C sugar and 2 Tbsp rum. Whip altogether until nice and fluffy. Set aside.
3. **Prepare tiramisu layers:** Dip each side of a lady finger into the coffee/rum mixture for no more than 1-2 seconds per side (DO NOT DIP TOO LONG; This is the biggest mistake in making tiramisu. NO SOGGINESS!). Then, carefully lay in a pan (8x5 in), making sure all the ladyfingers are lined up side by side; trim if needed to fix snuggly into pan. Then, add a generous, even layer of the mascarpone/cream mixture on top of the ladyfingers, smoothing them out on the edges with a spatula. Dust with some cocoa powder with a colander/sieve. Repeat the ladyfinger layer with the final mascarpone layer, and dust the top with cocoa powder and chocolate shavings if using.
4. **Refrigerate tiramisu** for at least 6 hours to allow it to set, and allowing the lady fingers to soften well. Cut with a clean knife, wiping off between slices for the cleanest edges, and enjoy!",2044

Equipment

* Large pot
* Medium pot
* Sheet pan
* Strainer or sieve

IngredientsBroth and Noodles:

* 2 tablespoons neutral oil for frying
* 1 yellow onion peeled and thinly sliced
* 4 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 1-3 Thai chili peppers trimmed and minced (adjust quantity based on spice preference)
* 4 scallions white parts minced, green parts thinly sliced on an angle
* 2 tablespoons Thai curry paste red, green, or yellow
* 6 cups chicken stock
* 1 tablespoon fish sauce or less, depending on preference
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 8 ounces vermicelli noodles
* Salt and pepper to taste

Shrimp and Vegetables:

* 1 pound jumbo shrimp peeled and deveined, tails discarded or kept on depending on preference
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes
* 1 lime juiced
* 2 tablespoons avocado oil
* 1 tablespoon fish sauce
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* ¼ teaspoon salt optional
* 1 bunch tatsoi or 4 heads baby bok choy, halved lengthwise

InstructionsCook the Broth Aromatics:

* Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until just beginning to turn translucent.
* Add the garlic, Thai chili pepper, and minced white parts of the scallions and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
* Add the curry paste and lightly mash it into the oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes until fragrant.

Simmer the Broth:

* Pour in the chicken stock. Add the sugar and fish sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Taste and season to your preferences. Keep warm.

Marinate the Shrimp:

* In a bowl, combine the lime juice, avocado oil, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil and whisk to combine. Add the shrimp and tomatoes to the bowl. Sprinkle with a ¼ teaspoon salt. Toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator for 15 minutes.

Cook the Noodles:

* Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook according to package instructions (typically 2-4 minutes for vermicelli). Drain and rinse thoroughly with cold water. Set aside. If needed, refresh the noodles with cold water before serving but if you time it correctly, they should only be sitting in the strainer for a few minutes.

Broil the Shrimp:

* Turn the broiler on. Pour the shrimp and excess marinade onto the sheet pan and arrange the shrimp and tomatoes in an even layer on half the sheet pan. Place the tatsoi on the other half of the sheet pan and sprinkle with salt and add a drizzle of oil.
* Transfer the sheet pan to the oven and broil for 4-5 minutes until the shrimp are just cooked through and the tatsoi is charred and the tomatoes have just begun the split open.

To Serve:

* Divide the cooked noodles between bowls. Ladle the broth on top. Arrange the shrimp, tomatoes, and tatsoi on top. Garnish with the thinly sliced scallion greens. Enjoy!

2021-02-22,14,"Homemade Cinnamon Rolls Recipe","pangibear","**Homemade Cinnamon Rolls**

Layers of soft chewy dough, with brown sugar cinnamon between each one, topped with a cream cheese frosting, all swirled into one treat.

### INGREDIENTS 

#### Cinnamon Roll Dough

* 1 c warm milk (not hot)
* 2-1/2 tsp Instant yeast
* 1/2 c granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 1/4 c butter, melted
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp salt
* 4 c flour

#### Filling

* 3/4 c brown sugar, packed
* 2 Tbsp cinnamon
* 1/2 c butter, softened

#### Icing

* 6 oz cream cheese, softened
* 1-1/2 c powdered sugar
* 1/3 c butter, melted
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Making the Dough

* Place warm milk in a mixing bowl, add yeast, and give it a stir. Let it sit for a minute or two while youre gathering your other ingredients. 
* Next, add sugar, eggs, butter, salt, and vanilla, and mix well. Lastly, using a dough hook, add flour and mix until it forms a firm yet tacky dough that pulls away from the edges. Resist adding more flour&the dough should be slightly tacky.
* Remove dough from the mixer and knead by hand, on a lightly floured surface, for 5 minutes (yes, even if you used a stand mixer).

#### First Rising

* Grease a large bowl with butter or cooking spray. Place the dough in this bowl, cover with a warm towel, and let sit in a warm spot for 1 to 1-½ hours or until it doubles in size.

#### Cinnamon Roll Filling

* In a bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until it resembles a paste.

#### Rolling out the dough, adding filling, and cutting into shape

* For this step, I used silicone baking mats, but you can also roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring approximately 22 x 14.
* Drop some of the cinnamon roll filling here and there over the rolled out dough. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently spread the filling all over the dough, keeping away from the edges by about a quarter inch.
* Starting at a short end (one of the 14 ends), gently but tightly roll the dough into one long roll.
* Using a sharp knife (I found that a serrated knife worked best), cut the roll into 12 evenly sliced pieces. 

#### Second Rising

* Preheat oven to 350	.
* Place the cut cinnamon rolls into a parchment-lined baking dish, three rows of four. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes, or until theyve nearly doubled in size.

#### Baking Cinnamon Rolls

* Remove the plastic wrap and place baking pan in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 20  30 minutes. My cinnamon rolls took 30 minutes to bake, but you should start checking on them after 20 minutes. All ovens are different. The cinnamon rolls will be done when the tops have just lightly browned and the dough sounds hollow when you lightly tap on it with a spoon. The rolls will rise even more while theyre baking and will most likely touch each other. This is fine and good&theyll stay soft in the middle.

#### Icing for Cinnamon Rolls

* While the rolls are baking, make the icing. Using either a stand mixer or handheld mixer, blend together cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla until smooth. 
* When the cinnamon rolls are done baking, let them cool about 5 minutes and add icing to the tops, so it will slightly melt and ooze between the swirls. If you prefer the icing thicker on top, wait until theyve fully cooled. ",3432

2. **Make the white cream**: in a pan fry the chopped onion and garlic, in a bit of Olive oil for about 2 minutes. Then pour the soy cream and let it steer for around 8-10minutes. 
3. **Grab the lasagna pasta**: follow the instruction on the pasta box for having it ready. 
4. **Layer it u**p: Start with a little sauce in the bottom of the pan to ensure your noodles dont stick to the bottom, then top with noodles, cream, and sauce and then repeat. Dump allllll of that extra mozzarella on the top for good measure!
5. **Cover and bak**e: Covering the lasagna with foil to bake ensures that the moisture stays inside and cooks the noodles. We will uncover once we add the cheese and let it sit at room temperature for some time before slicing to help it set well.

It's really simple to make and requires only a little prep time. The hardest part is finding Holy basil! I'm based in the UK where I can find it from Chinatown in London - I'm not sure of it's availability in the US but I'm sure East Asian grocers will stock in in places or it can be ordered online. If you can't find holy basil, it's better to use normal Italian basil instead as opposed to using Thai basil which has a aniseedy flavour.

[Video Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LJPS1lOHSM)

# Ingredients

Serving Size:  \~5 sandwiches      

* 1 cup of sushi rice
* 3/4 cups + 2 1/2 tbsp of water
* A small piece of konbu (kelp)
* 2 tbsp of rice vinegar
* 1 tbsp of sugar
* 1 tsp of salt
* 2 avocado
* 6 imitation crab sticks
* 2 tbsp of Japanese mayo
* 1/2 lb of salmon  

# Recipe     

* Place 1 cup of sushi rice into a mixing bowl and wash the rice at least 2 times or until the water becomes clear. Then transfer the rice into the rice cooker and add a small piece of kelp along with 3/4 cups plus 2 1/2 tbsp of water. Cook according to your rice cookers instruction.
* Combine 2 tbsp rice vinegar, 1 tbsp sugar, and 1 tsp salt in a medium bowl. Mix until everything is well combined.
* After the rice is cooked, remove the kelp and immediately scoop all the rice into the medium bowl with the vinegar and mix it well using the rice spatula. Make sure to use the cut motion to mix the rice to avoid mashing them. After thats done, cover it with a kitchen towel and let it cool down to room temperature.
* Cut the top of 1 avocado, then slice into the center of the avocado and rotate it along your knife. Then take each half of the avocado and twist. Afterward, take the side with the pit and carefully chop into the pit and twist to remove it. Then, using your hand, remove the peel. Repeat these steps with the other avocado. Dont forget to clean up your work station to give yourself more space. Then, place each half of the avocado facing down and thinly slice them. Once theyre sliced, slowly spread them out. Once thats done, set it aside.
* Remove the wrapper from each crab stick. Then, using your hand, peel the crab sticks vertically to get strings of crab sticks. Once all the crab sticks are peeled, rotate them sideways and chop them into small pieces, then place them in a bowl along with 2 tbsp of Japanese mayo and mix until everything is well mixed.
* Place a sharp knife at an angle and thinly slice against the grain. The thickness of the cut depends on your preference. Just make sure that all the pieces are similar in thickness.
* Grab a piece of seaweed wrap. Using a kitchen scissor, start cutting at the halfway point of seaweed wrap and cut until youre a little bit past the center of the piece. Rotate the piece vertically and start building. Dip your hand in some water to help with the sushi rice. Take a handful of sushi rice and spread it around the upper left hand quadrant of the seaweed wrap. Then carefully place a couple slices of salmon on the top right quadrant. Then place a couple slices of avocado on the bottom right quadrant. And finish it off with a couple of tsp of crab salad on the bottom left quadrant. Then, fold the top right quadrant into the bottom right quadrant, then continue by folding it into the bottom left quadrant. Well finish off the folding by folding the top left quadrant onto the rest of the sandwich. Afterward, place a piece of plastic wrap on top, cut it half, add a couple pieces of ginger and wasabi, and there you have it.",3203

### What is Tikka Masala sauce and where it comes from?

The history of this popular sauce is not 100% clear, some say it was created in India while others say it was created in the UK by Bangladeshi migrant Chefs. Whoever did it, did a good job, the sauce is one of the most popular in the world thanks to its mild and delicate flavour. In short, it is the smooth tomato-based curry sauce with the addition of **garam masala** and finished with yoghurt. The sauce is usually served with dry roasted marinated chicken or lamb (Tikka). From my experience, every Chef prepares it differently, what are your experiences with this sauce?

### Ingredients for Tikka Masala sauce:

* 1tbsp butter
* 1 banana shallot, finely diced

2021-02-20,3,"STRAWBERRY CAKE (recipe in comments)","Fistul-a","*Link to the video-tutorial and full recipe with all details is provided at the end of the comment.*

&amp;#x200B;

The strawberry cake requires 4 main preparations:

* two layers of Savoyard biscuit
* a dose of syrup for soaking the layers of Savoyard
* Mousseline cream with vanilla
* Chantilly cream for decoration

In addition, you will need about 500g of fresh strawberries of excellent quality, possibly large sized.

**Ingredients for the Savoyard biscuit**

* Flour (possibly weak W170): 150 g
* Egg whites: 180 g
* Egg yolks: 120 g
* Caster sugar: 150 g
* Icing sugar: 40 g

**Ingredients for the Syrup**

* Sugar: 70 g
* Water: 12 cl
* Kirsch: 2 cl

**Ingredients for the Mousseline cream with vanilla**

* Milk: 600 g
* Vanilla bean: 1
* Egg yolks: 120 g
* Caster sugar: 180 g
* Cornstarch: 60 g
* Butter (at 18° C): 300 g

**Ingredients for Chantilly Cream**

* Heavy cream: 200 g
* Icing sugar: 25 g
* Preparation

Preheat the oven to 180 °C and prepare the Savoyard biscuit. Whip the egg whites until stiff. When the egg whites are well whipped, gradually add the granulated sugar until the mixture is very firm. At this point gently add the egg yolks and whip again for 5 seconds. Sift the flour and add it by hand to the mixture (with a spatula), trying to mix the ingredients as best as you can.

While the two layers of biscuit are cooling down, prepare the Mousseline cream and the syrup. For the syrup, mix the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring periodically. Cook for 3 minutes, continuing to stir. For the Mousseline cream, divide both the butter and the sugar into two equal doses. Extract the seeds from the vanilla pod and heat the milk by inserting one of the two parts of sugar together with the seeds and the vanilla bean. You have to bring it to a boil and let it simmer for 5 minutes, so as to infuse the taste of vanilla into the milk. Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the starch and the remaining sugar. After a while, to facilitate whisking, add a little hot milk. Remove the vanilla pod from the boiling milk and add the egg mixture, stirring vigorously with the wooden spoon. Cook over very low heat until the cream has thickened well, in any case for at least 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and add one of the doses of butter, continuing to stir until it has completely dissolved. At this point, the cream must be allowed to cool until it reaches room temperature. When the cream is cooled, put it in the mixer and start whipping it at high speed. Cut the remaining amount of butter into small squares and gradually add it to the cream, continuing to whip. When the mixture is completely homogeneous and uniform, the mousseline cream is ready.

Wash the strawberries and cut them in half vertically, trying to make pieces all the same height. Before you start cutting them, select the most beautiful strawberry, which you will leave aside so that you can use it for the final decoration. Take the ring and use it to cut two perfect circles of Savoyard.

Start assembling the cake by inserting the acetate strip into the ring and inserting the various layers one after the other. Start with a layer of biscuit, which you will wet with a generous dose of syrup. Then, with the help of the sac-a-poche, make a first fairly thin layer of mousseline cream. Make a ledge of strawberries along the edge of the ring, placing the cut part of each strawberry in direct contact with the acetate. Cut the leftover strawberries into big pieces and fill the centre. Still using the pastry bag, fill each empty space with the Mousseline, starting from the edges of the cake, and make a final layer of cream over the strawberries. Place the second Savoyard biscuit on the cream, and wet this too with the syrup. Put the cake to cool in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes and in the meantime prepare the Chantilly cream.

Whip the cream in the mixer starting with a medium speed and gradually increasing until you reach the maximum speed. When the cream begins to grow in volume, gradually add the sugar. Continue whipping until smooth and satiny.

Take the cake from the refrigerator, remove both the acetate and the ring. With the help of the spatulas make an even layer of cream on top of the cake.

### INGREDIENTS 

* 4 Tbsp butter
* 4 leeks, trimmed and chopped to 1/8""
* 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 2-1/2 c chicken stock
* 2-1/2 c water
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 Tbsp chopped flat-leaf Italian parsley (plus more for garnish)
* 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves
* 1 lb Yukon potatoes, thinly sliced
* 1/4 c heavy cream
* Salt and pepper to taste

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* In a large pan, heat 4 Tbsp butter until it bubbles. 
* Then add the chopped leeks. Season with 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. Stir occasionally for about 10 minutes until the leeks get really soft and the edges begin to brown. 
* Add garlic and stir for another couple of minutes. Taste before the next step. 
* Add 5 c liquid (I use 50% chicken stock and 50% water) and the herbs. Taste and see if you like the balance so far. Some stocks are saltier than others. 
* Crank up the heat to bring it to a quick boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
* Add 1 lb of thinly sliced Yukon gold potatoes and let it simmer with the lid on for about 40 minutes. Stir occasionally.
* The soup is done when the potatoes are very tender and starting to fall apart. We might still have to add some more salt and pepper. Potatoes soak up some salt. Taste again. Season with salt until you achieve the desired yumminess. If you like, add a pinch of cayenne pepper, which really makes it pop. 
* Serve in a bowl, add a splash of heavy cream (if desired), and top with some fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley.
* If you prefer a creamy consistency, use an immersion blender and blend everything together before serving. ",1851

**To make the tadka**

**Ghee**

2 tbsp (heaped)

**Cumin Seeds**

1 tsp

**Ginger**

1 tbsp, grated

**Tomato Puree**

1 tsp, double concentrate

**STEPS**

**Step 1**

Wash lentils 3-4 times until the water runs clear.

**Step 2**

Drain well and transfer into a pressure cooker.  Add water along with salt and turmeric and then mix.

**Step 3**

Carefully secure the lid on the cooker and place on a high heat (if your pressure cooker has different valve settings, place on the highest one). 

When the pressure cooker first releases steam, reduce the temperature to medium and cook for 3 minutes. Then turn off the heat and remove from the hob.

**Step 4**

Allow the pressure cooker to rest for 2 minutes. Allow the steam to escape from your pressure cooker by either releasing the valve or, alternatively, place your cooker under a running cold tap until all of the steam has released.

Carefully remove the lid and check the lentils. The lentils should be soft and tender. Transfer to a serving bowl.

**Step 5**

To make the tadka, heat ghee in a small saucepan (you will need to work quickly and continuously mix everything while making the tadka). When the ghee is hot, add cumin seeds and ginger.

**Step 6**

Add tomato puree, asafoetida, green chilli, dried red chillies &amp; chilli powder. Mix continuously and bring the pan back on the hob. When you see a paste has formed, turn off the heat and drizzle on half of the tadka on the cooked dal. Mix well.

2021-02-18,7,"3-Ingredient Matcha Ice Cream (No Churn)","elle-cookerru","Sharing my Matcha ice cream recipe that requires only 3 ingredients, without an ice cream maker!

All you need for this recipe is matcha powder, whipping cream, and condensed milk, and you can make a homemade batch of matcha ice cream that's super creamy and full of matcha flavor, all without the trip to Japan.

You can use either a hand blender or a stand mixer for this recipe. Feel free to mix with your hands as well if you don't mind a serious arm workout :3. Enjoy everyone! x

**\[RECIPE (ONE LARGE PINT - 16 SERVINGS)\]**

**Ingredients:**

* 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
* 2 tbsp matcha powder, add more if desired
* 2 cups heavy whipping cream, cold

**Directions:**

1. Add sweetened condensed milk into a bowl. Sift in the matcha powder and mix until well combined. Set aside.
2. Add heavy cream to a mixing bowl, or into a bowl of a stand mixer. Start whipping on low speed, gradually increase the speed, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form. Fold in the matcha paste, and whip again on medium speed until well combined.
3. Transfer to an airtight container (or a loaf pan sealed tightly with plastic wrap) and freeze for at least 6 hours before serving. Enjoy with your favorite toppings!

**Notes:**

Chopped pistachios pair wonderfully with matcha ice cream. Other great toppings include white chocolate, fruits, or other chopped nuts.

Stored in an airtight container, matcha ice cream will last up to 6 weeks in the freezer. Thaw for about 10 minutes prior to serving for easy scooping!

2021-02-17,13,"Gnocchi with creamy sauce","tomdevincenzi","Here in Argentina we love pasta. I must have made gnocchi at least 20 times the past year (and i have a dough ready right now). My recipe is a little different but to each their own. Here's some tips I've learned:

\- cook potatoes in the oven, dont boil them. If you do they'll absorb too much water and the dough will be impossible to handle.

\- try replacing them with sweet potatoes, beets or pumpkin. One of my fav. is sweet potato gnocchi with a pinch of turmeric to enhance the color and a barely-cooked cherry tomatoes-garlic-olive oil sauce.

\- use a little more flour so they cook more ""al dente"" and not too soft. you should be able to feel the gnocchi with each bite. at least i prefer them that way. i hate it when they're too soft and sticky

\- leave the dough half an hour in the fridge so the moisture spreads evenly and the cold makes it harder. that way it'll be easier to manipulate

\- here, at least, everyone (and i mean everyone) knows this rule for gnocchi, ravioli and other similar pasta: throw the pasta in. once it boils, it'll be around a minute until they surface. once they do, they are ready. to my taste, if i waited another minute or two after they did, they'd be overcooked..... however, this probably has something to do with the fact that we make them a lot smaller than you did.

\- giving them the proper shape is important because it makes them hold the sauce. they should be like... folded on top of themselves with fork markings on the outside. its really easy to do. if you have a wooden mold (we usually do) its even easier and they'll look better.

2021-02-17,43,"Old Fashioned Pancake Recipe","PheonixOnTheRise","The simplest recipes are some of the hardest to perfect! A few tips based on your comment:
- Use fresh ingredients. If your baking powder and flour are old and expired youll have subpar results. 
- Let the batter rest a bit, not too long. 15-30 minutes at most. 
- Pans make a big difference. I like cast iron for heat retention. I would not use a Dutch oven or anything with tall sides for a pancake. With cast iron, never raise the heat over low-med for most cooking. With pancakes, closer to low. The pan retains heat really well and you want the pancake to have time to fully cook while getting a light golden brown versus dark and burnt. Slower is better. 
- Use a proper size laddle. One scoop into the pan. With this recipe it will be pretty bubbly so laddle one scoop into the pan and spread it a bit if you need to. Let it sit. Watch the steam rise off of it and the bubbles emerge from the batter as it cooks. Those butter chards are melting and leaving cavities as well. Once the bubbles have emerged across the pancake and the steam is slowing down its time to flip. If the pan temp is right it should be a golden brown. About a third of the time on flip side and its done. 
- if you want pancakes like the ones in the picture, dont be afraid to throw more oil in the pan. A tablespoon or two each time you laddle in new pancakes. 

Good luck!",1358

Oh ya, also I served it with some very basic white rice 

## INGREDIENTS

* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts (2 large breasts)
* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs (4 large thighs)
* 6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil divided
* 2 tsp cumin
* 2 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp allspice
* 3/4 tsp turmeric
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1 pinch cayenne
* Salt and black pepper
* Nonstick cooking oil spray

## Prepare Marinade

1. Slice the chicken breasts into 5-6 pieces each and the thighs into 3-4 pieces each. Place them in a marinating dish or large plastic zipper bag.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup olive oil, the spices, 3/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper (if you are salt sensitive, use 1/2 tsp of salt). Pour the spice marinade over the chicken pieces. Stir with a spoon till all the chicken pieces are evenly coated in the marinade.
3. Cover the marinating dish with plastic wrap, or close the zipper bag. Place chicken in the refrigerator and let it marinate at least 1 hour, up to overnight.

## Oven Cooking Method

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray the baking sheet with nonstick cooking oil. Place the chicken pieces on the sheet, evenly spaced.
2. Place the chicken in the oven. Let it roast for about 15 minutes until cooked through, turning the chicken pieces once with tongs halfway through cooking.
3. Take chicken out of the oven and let it cool slightly. Use a sharp knife to slice the meat into small, thin shawarma-like pieces.
4. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a skillet on the stovetop over medium. Pour half of the chicken into the skillet and saute for 3-4 minutes till the smallest pieces of chicken turn brown and crisp. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste, if desired.
5. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet. Heat another 1 tbsp of oil and saute the remaining chicken in the same way. Serve warm.

This is such an easy recipe and I can't believe I waited this long to roast whole ducks! This is now my second time roasting a whole duck and I love it.

# Ingredients:

* 5-6 pound whole pekin duck; giblets and neck removed (As you can see, I didn't detach my neck and just left it in the cavity...but if you have kitchen shears, feel free to remove the neck and use it in stock/gravy)
* Salt, pepper
* 8 clementines, divided
* 3-4 shallots
* 4 star anise pods
* 1/2 cup maple syrup
* 1 teaspoon dijon mustard

&amp;#x200B;

# Method:

* Preheat oven to 350ºF.
* Pat the duck dry and prick all over with a fork, or use a knife to create angled slits along the breast. Cut into the fatty parts around the drumsticks. You just want to make enough slits around the fatty part of the duck skin so that the fat renders out.
* Peel the shallots and quarter. Quarter 4 of the clementines. Stuff the duck with the clementines and shallots and tie the legs together. Season the duck liberally with salt and pepper.
* Line a baking sheet with foil and place a raised rack on the foil. Place the duck on top and transfer to the oven, breast-side up,  for 1 hour.
* Flip the duck and cook, breast-side down, for 1 more hour.
* Remove the duck from the oven. At this point, you can drain off the duck fat and reserve it for another use.
* Roast the duck, breast-side up for 40 minutes more.
* In a saucepan, combine the juice of remaining 4 clementines, maple syrup, 4 star anise pods, and 1 teaspoon dijon mustard. Bring to a boil and whisk until smooth. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat.
* Remove the duck from the oven and brush half the glaze over the duck. Return to the oven for 20 more minutes.
* Brush the duck with the remaining glaze and bake for 10 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil for 4-5 minutes until the skin darkens on top, being careful not to burn the sugars in the glaze.
* Remove from oven and serve! (If you're animals like us, you'll just sit and pick it clean instead of even carving it, lol)",2171

* 1-1/2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/2 lb cod (or any firm white fish), cut into 1"" pieces
* 1/3 lb medium shrimp (about 12), peeled and cleaned
* 1/4 lb sea scallops (about 4), quartered
* 1/3 tsp kosher salt
* 1/3 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 1 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 2 Tbsp butter
* 2 Tbsp minced shallots
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* Pinch of nutmeg (optional)
* 2 Tbsp flour
* 1 c milk

* Bunch of flat-leaf Italian parsley
* Your favorite side dish

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Put all the seafood in a bowl and season with 1/3 tsp kosher salt and 1/3 tsp freshly cracked pepper. 
* Heat 1-1/2 Tbsp olive oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat. 
* Add shrimp, fish, and scallops, and cook for about 6 minutes total, stirring occasionally. Make sure the pan is large enough that the seafood isnt crowded. If they touch each other, theyll steam. Cook in batches if necessary. 
* When done cooking, remove from heat, put in a bowl, and squeeze some fresh lemon juice over it (about 1 Tbsp).
* In the same pan, heat 2 Tbsp butter until the butter bubbles but doesnt smoke. 
* Add 2 Tbsp minced shallots, 1 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg (optional). 
* Stir a couple of times while cooking for about about 2 minutes (until shallots turn translucent). 
* Add 2 Tbsp flour and quickly whisk everything together (this step takes maybe 10 seconds).
* Add 1 c milk and 1/2 c half &amp; half and whisk until it reaches desired consistency. Itll take about 2 minutes for the flour and liquids to fully interact. Therefore, give it a little time before adjusting the desired thickness (by adding more milk or flour).
* Taste. Add kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper. Taste. Add 2 Tbsp dry sherry and whisk everything for 30 seconds or so. Taste again. 
* Get your (ideally pre-warmed) plates ready.

2021-02-12,9,"Chargrilled Oysters","thecaglediaries"," RECIPE

### Ingredients

* 2 Dozen Oysters, on the half shell
* 1/2 Cup Butter, salted
* 2 Tbsp. Garlic, minced
* 1 Tsp. Black Pepper
* 1/2 Tsp. Creole Seasoning
* 2 Tsp. Chopped Parsley
* 1 Cup Parmesan Cheese, freshly grated
* Chopped chives for garnish (optional)
* Lemon Wedges for garnish (optional)

### Instructions

1. Light your grill. If using a gas grill allow the temperature to settle at med-high. If using charcoal you'll want to add the oysters to cook once the coals have turned white and stopped smoking.
2. After opening the oyster shells lay the oysters out on a tray (try to preserve some of the juice inside if they have any)
3. In a bowl melt the butter, add the garlic, black pepper, creole seasoning and chopped parsley and stir until combined.
4. Spoon evenly onto each oyster.
5. Place the oysters on the grill once ready and cook for 5 minutes. You'll notice the outer edges start to bubble.
6. At this point add a pinch of parmesan cheese to each oyster and cook for a further 2-3 minutes.
7. Remove from the grill and serve immediately with lemon wedges and hot sauce.

### Notes

When opening your oysters, if they are fresh enough and you don't mind doing so try one of them (or try the juice inside) to check for saltiness. If they're not salty add more seasoning to the butter mixture.

* 2 1/2 pounds pork, assorted

* 1 pound of tomatillos, husked and halved

* 2 poblano peppers, veins and seeds removed

* 2 jalapeno or serrano peppers, veins and seeds
 removed
* 1/2 cup cilantro, loosely chopped

* 2 teaspoons of dried oregano

* 6 cloves of garlic

* 2 onions, one cut into chunks, one diced

* 6 cups of chicken stock or broth

* 2 tablespoons of oil

* 45-50 ounces of hominy, drained


__Garnish__

* tostadas

* sliced radish

* diced onion

* shredded cabbage

* lime

* avocado slices



__Preparation__

In a blender combine the garlic, cilantro, one chunked onion, jalapenos, poblanos, and tomatillos with 1 cup of the chicken stock or broth. It will need to be fully processed, so its best to do it a little at a time.
Warm 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the blended green sauce to the skillet and then bring it to a boil.

Reduce the sauce to a simmer and stir occasionally until the sauce thickens, which takes up to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and salt/pepper to taste.
Alongside cooking the green sauce, heat the other tablespoon of oil in a dutch oven or large soup pot to brown the meat.

Brown the pork a little at a time, take it out and set it aside.

Add the diced onions and cook until desired crispiness. Pour the other 5 cups of chicken stock or broth remaining into the dutch oven or large soup pot and scrape up the burnt pieces along the bottom for added flavor.

Add the browned pork. Add the 45-50 ounces of hominy (size depending on retail). Add the 2 tablespoons of oregano and mix it together. Bring to a boil.

Reduce to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Stir the green sauce and continue cooking, stirring occasionally. This process takes 1-2 hours on a low simmer or until the pork is very tender and falling off the bone.

Add salt/pepper to taste. Garnishes can be oregano, sliced radishes, diced onion, shredded cabbage, sliced lime, sliced avocado, and tostadas.

  **Ingredients:**  

* Day 1: -  50 g of wheat flour

\-5 raisins or 1 date or  1  teaspoon of honey 

*  Day 2: -50 g of flour

* Day 4: -100 g of flour or wheat flour or whole wheat flour 

\-100 ml of water at room  temperature 

*  Day 5: -100 g of wheat flour or whole wheat flour   

\-100 ml of water at room temperature 

**Instructions**

  Day 1 

*  Mix 50 g of wheat flour and 50 ml of water in a glass jar (5 raisins or 1 date or 1 teaspoon of honey) to speed up the fermentation process.  
* \-Put the lid of the jar without adjusting and let it rest at room temperature for a minimum of 24 hours or until you see some bubbles in the dough  

   Day 2 

* Add 50 g of flour and 50 ml of water at room temperature and mix well with the ingredients in the jar. Let rest 24 hours again  

\-Day 3  

* Throw half of the mixture and add 100 g of wheat flour or wholemeal flour and 100 ml of water at room temperature. Mix well and let stand 24 hours at room temperature 

Day 4

*  10-Discard all the dough except 100 g and add 100 of flour or wholemeal flour and 100 ml of water at room temperature. Let rest 24 hours again  
*  From this moment the dough should be fermenting and making bubbles   

 \-Day 5  

* \- You have to repeat the same process on day 4 Discard all the dough except 100 g, add 100 g of flour or wholemeal flour and 100 ml of water at room temperature. Let it rest for 24 hours again. The sourdough is active.

 Tips -

* Each time we see that it has fermented, we must refresh or feed the dough by pulling it and adding the corresponding amounts. In this way the sourdough will remain in perfect condition. 
*  We should always keep it at room temperature.  
* If we are not going to use it for a while, it can be kept in the fridge. In this way, feeding it once a week is enough, we will remove it from the refrigerator, feed it, let it ferment and then we will store it cold again.  
* We can also freeze the sourdough. - We can add some acid to avoid bacteria that spoil the dough, such as vinegar or lemon.",2286

Roll out the dough and make a 4mm thick circle, with which you will line a buttered mould. Cut the excess dough with a rolling pin, prick the bottom with a fork and spread a light layer of jam on the bottom and sides.

Pour a first thin layer of cream on the bottom and add on top of it the cherries. Place them with the help of kitchen nipper, one at a time, and try to create a regular pattern in which the space between the cherries is as regular as possible.

Pour the second layer of cream, being careful to cover completely the black cherries. It is essential that the level of the cream is lower than the edge of the pastry, I suggest to keep a margin of at least 1 cm. This type of cream increases in volume during cooking and we must prevent it from overflowing. Finally, gently pour the sliced almonds over the cream.

The tart is baked in the static oven for approximately 35 minutes at 185 °C. During cooking, the surface of the cream will take on a dark brown colour. It is absolutely normal. Once the tart is out of the oven, wait for it to reach room temperature and then take it out of the mould and cover it with a light dusting of icing sugar.

The fluffy, chocolaty bun definitely worked really well with the sweet strawberry preserve filling. It's a pretty easy recipe to execute, just a bit time consuming. Either way the end result is definitely worth it!

# Ingredients

Serving Size: \~12 buns

1 tsp yeast

* 1/4 tsp sugar
* 1/4 cup water, warmed up to 110-115oF
* 1 &amp; 1/2 cups all purpose flour
* 1 &amp; 1/2 tbsp of granulated sugar
* 3 tbsp of cocoa powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 6 tbsp of whole milk
* 2/3 cups of strawberry preserves/jam

# Recipe

* In a small bowl, combine 1/4 tsp of sugar and 1/4 cup of water warmed up to 110-115°F and give it a little mix. Then sprinkle 1 tsp of yeast on top and let it sit for about 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, you should start seeing bubbles appearing on top of the mixture. Once thats done, set it aside.
* Then, in a standing mixer, combine 1 &amp; 1/2 cups of all purpose flour, 1 &amp; ½ tbsp of granulated sugar, 3 tbsp of cocoa powder, ¼ tsp of salt, and the yeast mixture. Attach the dough hook, and start mixing on low. Slowly add 6 tbsp of whole milk, 1 tbsp at a time. Once everything is mixed, turn the speed up to medium and let it knead for at least 5-10 minutes. After 5-10 minutes, you should have a very smooth dough. Remove the dough hook, cover the mixing bowl with a piece of plastic wrap, and set it aside in a warm place for the dough to proof for at least 2-3 hours.
* After 2-3 hours, the proofed dough should have doubled in size. Take it out of the oven and put it back in the mixer and let it go for another 2-3 minutes.
* Then, transfer the dough to a clean and lightly floured surface. Roll the dough into a log and equally divide it into 12 pieces. Then cover them with a plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out while you assemble the buns. Take one dough ball and start rolling it out into a slightly thin disc. Then, roll out the outer part of the disc into a thinner layer. We want to have a disc-shaped dough with a thicker center and thinner outer layer. Then, using a small ice cream scooper, place 1 small scoop of strawberry preserves onto the center of the dough. Then, use your thumb and index finger to start folding a pleat all around the thin outer layer of the dough. When you get to the end, use your thumb and index finger to pinch the top of the dough and twist to completely close the bun. Then place it on a piece of parchment paper or cupcake wrapper, and repeat with the rest of the dough.
* Once youve rolled out all your dough, then its time to steam them! Working in batches, place a few doughs into your steamer basket. Then place the steamer on a pan or wok filled with around 2 inches of water. Turn the heat on medium and let it steam for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, turn off the heat and let it sit for another 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, take it out and let it cool for at least 30 minutes.
* Once the waiting is over, take it out, remove the parchment paper from the bottom, and there you have it!",3281

Ingredients:

 250g AP flour

 1tsp salt

 110g water

 4 large shrimp

 500g basa fillet

 4 green onions

 2tbsp oil

 2tbsp cornstarch

 1tsp white pepper

 1tsp soy sauce

 1tsp salt

 1/2tbsp cooking wine

 1 egg

&amp;#x200B;

Directions:

1. First make the dough for the dumpling skin.  Start by mixing the flour, salt and water together in a large bowl.

2. Once the mixture clumps together in pieces, bring it together into with your hands into a rough dough and begin kneading.  The dough will feel rough and dry at first but will become softer as you knead.  Continue for around 10 - 15 minutes until you get a smooth ball.  Cover and set aside to rest.

3. Meanwhile make the filling.  Finely mince the green onion and ginger together.

4. Add 2 tbsp oil to a pan over medium heat.  Once the oil is warm, add the green onion and ginger and stir for around 2 minutes until it forms a paste.  Toasting the onion and ginger this way helps to bring out the flavour more compared to simply adding it into the filling mixture raw.  Set aside to cool.

5. Chop up both the shrimp and fish into small pieces.  Mince the two together until you get a fine paste - it will take around 10 minutes.

6. Add the green onion and ginger paste, cornstarch, white pepper, soy sauce, salt, cooking wine and egg to the fish and shrimp paste.  Mix everything together in one direction only, until the paste becomes very thick and forms strands.

7. To make the dumpling skins, take the dough and poke a hole through the centre so that it forms a doughnut shape.  Gently squeeze the dough as you move it through your hands to make the ring thinner.

8. Cut the ring of dough into evenly sized pieces, about 1.5cm long.  Toss the pieces together in some flour to prevent them from sticking together.

9. Flatten each piece with the heel of your palm.  Using one hand, roll the edges of the skin with a rolling pin while the other hand rotates the skin.  Make sure to rotate the skin evenly and roll only the edges so that the centre is slightly thicker.

10. To assemble, place a small amount of filling in the centre of the wrapper.  Bring the top and bottom edges together and pinch shut at the centre.  Then fold in from each end towards the centre to create pleats.

11. To cook the dumplings, add a small amount of oil to a flat bottom, nonstick pan over medium heat.  Place the dumplings, pleated side up, in a circle around the pan.

12. Once the dumpling start to sizzle, add some hot water to the pan and cover with a lid.  Turn the heat down to low and let fry for about 10 - 12 minutes.  You may need to add more water as it cooks if you see the pan starting to dry up.

13. When dumplings are cooked, place a plate over the pan and flip it over.

14. Enjoy the dumplings on its own or with some dipping sauce.",2882

Once cooked through, drain from the liquid, discard spices, allow to cool then chop it with a knife. (Sauerkraut will be nice and soft)

**2.** While waiting for sauerkraut, get a medium-sized frying pan and heat **2tbsp of oil**. Sweat the **onions** in **medium heat** for around **5 minutes**. Next, add **mushrooms** and **turn up the heat**. Pan fry until mushrooms are cooked through and start to brown, then stir in **1tsp of butter** and season with **salt and black pepper**.

Then make **five 3cm cuts on the left and right side of the square**. Place **80g of the filling** in the middle and braid the dough by pulling each cut to the opposite side starting from the left to right.

Brown and drain ground bison, put in the bottom of foil pan.
Drain the canned tomatoes and chilies and add to the top of the meat.
Dice poblano pepper and add to the mixture.
Cut cheese in to blocks and add to the top of the foil pan.
Run the smoker at 250°F, we used Texas Smokehouse Post Oak.

This cake requires two main preparations:

* a sablé dough with almonds (to be prepared one day in advance)
* a dose of vanilla custard

You will also need approximately 600 g of fresh berries (in my case I used blackberries, raspberries and currants), a dose of gelatine for cakes, and a small dose of apricot jam.

* Whole Eggs: 40 g
* Egg Yolks: 40 g
* Vanilla Extract: 2 g
* Grated Lemon Peel: 2g
* Salt: 2 g

Mix the ingredients by placing them in this order: butter and flour, vanilla, salt, lemon, eggs and almonds (alternating) and finally the sugar. The sablé shall be prepared at least one day in advance and put to rest one night in the fridge (+4°C).

Basically, it is a variant of the standard pastry cream, with the difference that we leave the seeds and the vanilla bean in the milk at a high temperature (the berry will then be removed before adding the other ingredients).

* Milk: 500 g
* Caster sugar: 80 g
* Egg yolks: 100 g (approximately 5 large eggs)
* Flour: 18 g
* Cornstarch: 18 g
* Vanilla beam: 1

Put to boil the milk together with the seeds and the empty beam of vanilla. Leave it in infusion for at least five minutes with the flame of the stove to a minimum and, after that, the remove the empty beam.

This tart is made with the technique of the blind-baking, i.e. the shell of dough is baked empty, and then filled with pastry cream and fruit. This is because both the custard and the berries do not require a passage in the oven, so the base will be prepared and cooked on its own.

Roll out the cold dough to a thickness of 4mm and line the greased mould. Pay close attention to making the pastry adhere well to the lower corners of the mould. With the help of a fork make many small holes in the bottom of the dough, then cover with baking paper and fill the mould with ceramic balls, or rice or alternatively beans. These weights, together with the holes you just made in the pastry, prevent the bottom of the dough from lifting during cooking, and also that the sides of the dough collapse downwards.

The shell is cooked in two steps: for the first 15 minutes with the weights, for the remaining 10 minutes without the weights. The oven temperature must be 170 ° C. Static oven with closed valve.

Once cooked, remove the shell from the oven and let it cool before separating it from the mould. Before filling the tart, spread the bottom of the cooked shortcrust with a light layer of apricot jam. This will help the base of the cake stay dry when we add the cream.

At this point, all that remains is to gently pour the custard into the shell, level with a spatula, and add, one at a time, all the berries on the surface. Design a regular pattern, for example alternating the different fruits, and proceed by making concentric circles, starting from the edges towards the centre of the cake. Use one of the prettiest fruits for the exact centre of the cake. Finally, prepare the tart jelly following the manufacturers instructions and brush a light layer of gel over the fruit, without overdoing it.

Leave the cake in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. The tart can be stored for a few days at a temperature of 4 ° C.

### Ingredients

* FOR THE OYSTERS
* 1 Pint Oysters, shucked (about 4 dozen)
* 3 Large Eggs
* 2 Tbsp. Cream
* 1 Tsp. Garlic Powder
* 1 Tsp. Onion Powder
* 1 Tsp. Black Pepper
* 1 Tsp. Creole Seasoning (low salt)
* 2 Cups Cornmeal Mix
* Peanut Oil, enough for frying
* FOR THE REMOULADE SAUCE
* 1/2 Cup Mayonnaise
* 1/4 Cup Sour Cream
* 2 Tsp. Dijon Mustard
* 2 Tsp. Stone Ground Mustard
* 1 Tbsp. Ketchup
* 1/2 Tsp. White Vinegar
* 1 Tsp. Hot Sauce
* 1 Green Onion, sliced
* Salt and Pepper to taste
* FOR THE PO'BOYS
* Po'Boy Bread, or hoagie rolls will work
* Shredded Lettuce
* Tomatoes, sliced
* Pickles, sliced

### Instructions

1. Shuck oysters (if they are not already done so.)
2. Take eggs, cream, garlic powder and onion powder and beat until combined.
3. Add cornmeal mix, creole seasoning and black pepper and stir well to combine.
4. Take the oysters and drop into the egg mixture, then coat in the cornmeal mixture.
5. Fry in peanut oil that is 350°F for about 2 minutes only.
6. Remove immediately and allow to drain on paper towel.
7. For the Remoulade Sauce take all the ingredients and mix well to combine.
8. On a Po'Boy bun put a layer of shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes and sliced pickles.
9. Add fried oysters and drizzle with Remoulade Sauce.

### Notes

As long as the oysters are fresh, and you are comfortable doing so, taste the raw oyster before you add the seasoning. If your oysters are nice and salty (which is what you want) don't add salt to your frying ingredients. If they are not salty go ahead and add some. This was why I said to use a low salt creole seasoning, you don't want to over season your oysters.

Do not fry too many oysters at the same time as this may cause them to stick together or some be more cooked than others. Cook in batches.

If you don't have a thermometer for your grease you can check with the handle of a wooden spoon, bubbles will fizz around the wood once it is up to temperature.

2021-02-05,5,"Heart Shaped Strawberry Milk Custard Steamed Buns for Valentine's Day","angusbeefcake555","I've been watching a lot of Korean cafe vlogs lately, and it's strawberry season over there so strawberry milk and lattes are very popular right now. I started thinking of a dessert I could make with strawberry milk and came up with these heart shaped buns just in time for Valentine's day. I tried more than 15 times to use fresh strawberry milk, but the pectin in the strawberries ruined the texture of the custard and the color would turn an ugly greyish pink after cooking. I ended up using strawberry milk made from Hershey's strawberry syrup, but Nesquik would probably work too. I'm not sure if store bought strawberry milk would work. Maybe with the right preservatives, but unfortunately you definitely shouldn't use fresh strawberries. I didn't use any additional food coloring and ended up with a pale pink bun with a coral colored custard. You can add food dye to the milk if you want a pinker color, or add extra strawberry syrup/Nesquik.

# Recipe

Makes 4

**Ingredients:**

Custard

* 180ml strawberry milk
* 2 large egg yolks
* 1tb sugar
* 2tb cornstarch
* 1tb cold butter, cubed

Dough

* 60ml warm strawberry milk
* 1/2tsp yeast
* 1tb sugar
* 1tsp vegetable oil
* 100g all-purpose flour

**Instructions:**

1. Start by making the strawberry milk custard. Beat two large egg yolks in a bowl, then whisk in 1tb of sugar and 2tb of cornstarch.
2. Heat 180ml of strawberry milk in a saucepan on medium heat until wisps of steam just start to appear. Gradually whisk in the hot milk to the egg yolks. Start with a small amount, a couple tablespoons worth, and then slowly pour in the rest of the milk while whisking. Take it slowly so as to not scramble the yolks. You can use more milk to make the custard runnier, but a looser custard will be hard to work with.
3. Pour the custard mixture back into the saucepan on medium heat. Keep whisking the custard until it thickens completely. Nothing will happen at first, and then things will suddenly start to thicken. Lift the saucepan off the heat to stay in control if needed.
4. Move the custard into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and let cool. When the custard is cool enough to handle, divide into four and roll each portion in a flat ball. Cover again and let rest in the fridge until the dough is ready.
5. Make the dough. Add 60ml of warm strawberry milk to a bowl, then add 1/2tsp of yeast, 1tb of sugar, 1tsp of vegetable oil, and 90g of all-purpose flour. Mix until a dough forms, and then knead the dough for about 10min or until smooth. Add the remaining 10g of all-purpose flour if needed. Form into a ball, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for about 2 hours or until doubled in size.
6. While the dough and custard rest, prepare sheets of parchment paper and molds to shape the buns into heart shapes. Heart shaped cookie cutters work, but I made my molds from aluminum foil. Take a 6"" piece of aluminum foil and fold into sixths so you have a 1"" high piece. Start folding the foil in half width wise, then shift one end so you have an extra 2"" of foil on one side. Fold down the 2"" of extra foil.. Open up the shorter end of the foil, and tuck in the 2"" overhang. Use this overlapping portion of foil as the pointy bottom of the heart. Invert the other end of the foil and adjust the shape of the foil to form a heart. Lightly oil the interior of each heart mold to prevent the buns from sticking.
7. When the dough has doubled in size, divide into four pieces. Roll each piece out into a circle about 1/4"" thick. Then roll out the edges of the dough to be about 1/8"" thick, leaving about a 2"" diameter circle of thicker dough in the center.
8. Place a ball of custard in the center of the dough, and fold the edges of the dough in towards the center. If your dough feels dry, then use your finger to wet the outer edge before folding. If you think there isn't enough dough or there is too much custard, then you can cut some of the custard out. Make sure your folds overlap in the center so the custard is completely covered.
9. Shape the bun into a heart shape by pinching one side of the bun to form the point of the heart. Use a knife to press into the opposite side to form the heart.
10. Place each bun onto parchment paper and place the aluminum mold around the bun. Adjust the shape of the molds and buns to fit each other better. Place the buns in a steamer basket.
11. Bring a pot of water to a simmer and turn off the heat. Place the steamer baskets on top. Proof the buns over the hot water for about 10minutes until puffy. You can gently adjust the shapes of the buns after proofing.
12. Bring the pot of water to a boil and steam the buns for 10minutes. Then let the buns rest undisturbed in the baskets for 5 minutes. Enjoy the buns while they are still hot and fresh!",4790

* 100g (½ cup) light brown sugar
* 1 large egg
* 225ml (1 cup) strong-brewed coffee

2021-02-04,41,"Korean Shrimp Burger","elle-cookerru","On my visits back home to South Korea, one of the food items I enjoy the most is the Shrimp Burger (È°p) sold in their local fast-food restaurants.

Before the travel restrictions took place, experiencing localized fast food in each area truly made up my travels, as each region has its own specialized dishes that cater to the demographic.

One of the most popular fast food items in Korea is the shrimp burger, also known as Ebi Katsu burger in Japan. Outside of Asia however, this kind of burger is extremely rare to find, which made it the perfect case for me to recreate the recipe at home!

This Korean Shrimp Burger brings together panko-breaded shrimp patties, lettuce, tomato, mozzarella cheese, and homemade sauce all wrapped in buttery brioche buns. Make this shrimp burger from scratch at home in just 20 minutes, without the trip to Asia. Enjoy everyone! x

**\[RECIPE (2 SERVINGS)\]**

**Ingredients:**

**Shrimp Patty**

* 16 (180g) large shrimp, half finely minced, and half diced
* 2 tbsp onion, chopped
* 3 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 1 tbsp water, add more if needed
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, to coat the patty
* 1 large egg, beaten
* 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
* light pinch of salt and pepper

**Burger sauce**

* 4 tbsp mayonnaise, preferably kewpie
* 1 tsp ketchup
* 1/2 tsp yellow mustard, or wasabi if preferred

**Directions:**

**Shrimp Patty**

1. Prepare three separate trays with flour, egg, and panko bread crumbs.
2. In a small mixing bowl, add shrimp (half minced and half diced), onion, a small pinch of salt and pepper, and mix together. Add 3 tbsp flour and a tbsp of water and combine well. Lightly wet your hands with water, and shape into patties.
3. Carefully coat each patty with flour, egg, and bread crumbs in order, making sure each side is evenly coated, shaking off any excess. Set aside for 10 minutes before frying.
4. Prepare at least 2 inches of oil in a large skillet (or a deep fryer) on medium heat. Once the oil reaches 350°F, cook 3 or 4 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Remove from oil, and place the mozzarella cheese slice on top to melt in the heat.

**Burger sauce**

1. In a small bowl, add mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, onion, and a light pinch of pepper. mix well to combine.

**Assembly**

1. Lightly toast the brioche buns with butter. Spread each burger slice with a generous amount of burger sauce. Top with lettuce, shrimp patty with cheese on top, tomato, lettuce. Serve immediately.

**Notes:**

These shrimp burger patties can be frozen for later use, although serving it fresh does yield the best results. Simply add a few more minutes to the frying time upon cooking, and assemble with fresh toppings.

2021-02-03,4,"Savory Winter Pie","saucesandwich_","I  was really craving some comfort food to get me through this blizzard  and this savory venison pie was just the trick. This would be equally as  good with beef or even lamb, but I was excited to use some of my  venison from this year's harvest. Recipe as follows and you can [see a short video of the entire process here](https://youtu.be/05-C7CwTXF4).

**The Filling (Stew)**

**Ingredients:**

3 pounds of venison (or other meat of choice), cubed into stew sized pieces

2 Leeks (finely chopped)

5 - 7 medium sized carrots (half finely diced and the other half chopped into larger pieces that youll add later)

2 -  3 ribs of celery (finely chopped)

4 cloves of garlic (minced)

1 cup of frozen peas

1 cup of white wine

5 leaves of fresh sage (finely minced)

Few sprigs of thyme

Flour

1-2 tbsp butter

4-6 cups of beef/chicken broth (homemade is best)

**Directions:**

1. Bring a large dutch oven to medium heat on the stove top. Add some olive oil to cover the bottom.
2. Brown your meat in batches and set aside in a pan.
3. Add  butter to the pot. Once it melts sprinkle in a few tbsp of flour. Stir  constantly and scrape up any bits of meat stuck to the bottom of the  pan. The roux will start to darken over the next few minutes.
4. Add the chopped celery, finely diced carrots, garlic, leeks, thyme, and sage. Saute for a few minutes until softened.
5. Add the white wine and cook down for a few more minutes.
6. Return the meat back to the pot and set to a low simmer.
7. Add  in the warmed broth, cup by cup, until it comes up to almost the top of  the meat. You do not want to fully submerge the meat. Simmer on low,  uncovered, stirring frequently for the next 3-4 hours until the meat is  tender. As the liquid cooks down, you should add more broth periodically  to maintain a consistent level in the pot. As the stew cooks, you can  prepare the pie dough.
8. After about 3 hours, add the larger pieces of carrots and allow to cook for at least another 10-15 minutes.
9. Add in the frozen peas. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for at least 30 minutes.

**The Pie Crust**

Im using a Smitten Kitchen recipe for my pie dough which uses the following ingredients.

**Ingredients:**

8 tbsp butter

1 cup of all purpose flour

1/3 tsp sea salt

1/4 cup cold water

1/2 tbsp granulated sugar

I followed her recipe and was very satisfied with the results.

**The Final Pie**

**Ingredients:**

1 marrow bone

Egg wash

**Directions:**

1. Set your oven to 375F.
2. Place the marrow bone in the center of your pie dish.
3. Fill the remaining area of the dish with the stew all the way up to the top of the dish.
4. Roll out your pie dough so it is a few inches larger than the pie dish youll be baking in.
5. Using a knife make an X in the middle of the dough slightly larger than the diameter of the marrow bone.
6. Carefully  slip on the dough so that the marrow bone slides through the X and use  your hands to shape the dough over the surface of the edges of the dish.  Pinch the rim all the way around and let the excess dough hang over the  edges like a skirt.
7. Use a fork to press around the entire circumference of the dish.
8. Using a sharp knife make a few Xs in the surface of the dough to allow for additional steaming.
9. Brush on the egg wash all over the dough. Make sure to get the sides as well.
10. Bake for about 40 minutes until the crust is golden brown and flaky.
11. Allow to cool for about ten minutes before serving.",3472

**Ingredients for the Risotto**

* Two shallots
* 400 grams risotto rice
* 200 ml white wine
* 1.2 l mushroom/vegetable broth
* salt/pepper to taste
* 200-400 grams mushrooms (have some fun and the quantity is to your liking)

**Directions for the Risotto**

There's not much to the mushroom risotto; I started by frying some shallots in a couple of tablespoons olive oil. After a minute or two I'll add 400 grams of risotto rice, and after another minute I'll cook the alcohol off from 200 ml of white wine. You follow it up by letting the risotto rice soak through 1.2 L of mushroom broth.

In a separate pan, you cook down the mushrooms, reducing the moisture. Because I was also using some dried mushrooms, I added those into the risotto, last second, and cooked them for 3 minutes. When you're happy with your mushrooms, season to taste, you add them back to the risotto, and you're ready to serve. At this step, you can also add some parmesan, but my version was vegan.

**Ingredients (makes 3 servings)**

*Dragon Sauce*

* 1/4 cup chili garlic sauce (I'd use less if your spice tolerance isn't high)
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup brown sugar

*Pork and Noodles*
    
* 1/2 lb. ground pork* 
* 6 oz. ramen noodles 
* 3 green onions, sliced 
* 1/4 cup unsalted peanuts, chopped
* *Extra* - I added thin half slices of a zucchini for more veggies

**Instructions:**

1. Combine the chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a bowl.
2. Add the ground pork to a skillet and cook over medium heat until it is fully browned (add the zucchini a few minutes after you start cooking the pork). Once browned, add the prepared dragon sauce and chopped peanuts. Allow the pork, zucchini and peanuts to simmer in the sauce for another 5 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced by half.
3. While the pork is browning, begin boiling water for your noodles. Once boiling, add your noodles and cook according to the package directions. Drain the noodles in a colander.
4. Once the sauce has reduced and the noodles have drained, add the noodles to the skillet and toss until everything is combined and coated in sauce. Top with sliced green onions and serve!

**Note:** Instead of ramen noodles, I used frozen Udon noodles from the local Asian store. Also, the pork usually has enough fat where you don't need to use any extra oil in your skillet when cooking. If there is an excess amount of fat after browning, I suggest draining the meat and leaving 1 Tbsp fat in the skillet to combine with the dragon sauce.",1610

* 228g grams all-purpose flour
* 1.5 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1 Tbs Kosher salt and 1.5 tsp  black pepper
* 130 grams unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
* 4 oz grated Gruyère 						
* ice water 					

**Ingredients - Filling:**

* Olive oil
* butter
* 1 large or two small onions
* 4 fresh thyme sprigs
* Salt and pepper
* Sliced crimini mushrooms, 2-3 cups (or any combination of mushrooms you like)
* 1/4 cup dry sherry (vermouth or dry white wine in a pinch)
* 1 cup beef broth
* Broccolini

**NOTES:** A good home-made beef stock makes a giant difference here; store-bought beef stock is barely-OK stuff; if you're stuck with it, reduce 2-3 cups of boxed stock down to 1 cup. We make this for meatless dinners, but you could think of it as ""modern meatloaf"" - what's in the fridge that you want to use? This takes some time, but it's a nice Sunday afternoon project.

**Directions:**

Prepare the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, salt and  black pepper. Add chopped butter and grated Gruyère to the flour mixture and toss to coat. Pinch the butter and cheese into the flour to make pebble-size pieces and smeared-flat butter blobs. Drizzle in ice water a little at a time, and stir to make a shaggy dough. Gently knead the dough on a floured surface 3-4 times, form into a fat disc, and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for an hour or more. 

Preheat oven to 375°

Put the wrapped dough ball on the counter to begin warming a bit.

Slice the onions into 1/4"" thin slices. Heat a skillet to medium with a tbs or so olive oil; when the oil is warm, add 1 tbs butter. Add the onions and thyme sprigs, toss to coat, and cover the pan for 5 minutes until the onions soften. remove the lid and cook the onions until edges are golden brown and onions are very soft, 15-20 minutes, tossing occasionally. Don't burn 'em. 

While the onions are cooking, cut the broccolini. You want 1-2 cups. Slice the bottoms of the stems so the remaining spears are 4-5"" long, and slice each spear from top to bottom - you want the stems to be 1/8"" - 1/4"" thick. Slice the florets into somewhat flat pieces, and slice the stems into 1"" long segments. 

Remove the onions to a mixing bowl. Add another Tbs of olive oil and heat the skillet to medium high. When the oil is hot, add 2 tbs butter; when the butter melts, quickly add the mushrooms, some salt and pepper to taste, and cover the pan (this releases liquid from the mushrooms without drying them out instantly). After 2-3 minutes, remove the lid and toss the mushrooms, and cover for another minute or so. Remove the lid and continue cooking the mushrooms until well browned.

Return the onions to the pan and add the sherry; deglaze the pan with a spatula and add the stock. Turn up the heat and reduce until the liquid thickens; reduce the heat to medium-low and continue stirring until the liquid thickens a bit more, to a sauce, Add the broccoli and toss until coated. Discard the thyme sprigs.

Transfer the onion mixture to a bowl and put it in the fridge or freezer - you want to cool it until it's just barely warm.

Lay out a sheet of parchment paper, about 18"" long. Lightly flour the paper, unwrap the dough, and place it dead-center on the paper. With your fingers, gently work the dough into a disc, about 8"" wide. Sprinkle flour on the top, and use a rolling pin to make a 15-16"" circle. Parchment paper is 15"" wide, so just go past the 15"" edges. The edges don't need to be perfectly round.

Spoon the cooled onion mixture on the center of the dough, and spread it so it covers about 10-11"" of the center; you want about 4 to 5 inches of dough left all around. Fold the dough up over the filling so about 6"" of filling is exposed. Gently tap the high folded spots down a bit. Lift the parchment paper to place the gallette on a large baking sheet and into the oven.

This needs to bake about 40-50 minutes; but check it after 15 minutes - if butter is pooling around the sides, mop it up with a paper towel and tongs so keep butter from running down into the oven and burning. At 25 minutes, rotate the baking sheet 180° and mop up any more butter.

When the crust is golden brown, sprinkle 1 oz of grated Gruyere across the top and return to the oven for 5 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Using the parchment paper, move the gallette from the sheet to a cutting board and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing like a pizza. You can garnish with fresh thyme leaves if you like.",4508

This is my take on the Italian recipe ""Gnocchi alla Sorrentina"", with a Spanish twist using Romesco sauce, a traditional tomato-based sauce from Catalonia. 

The end result is a fantastic bubbly sauce with hints of garlic, smoked paprika and almonds.

**Ingredients**

* 500 gr of Gnocchi
* Parmesan cheese

*For the Romesco sauce*:

* 5-6 ripe tomatoes
* 3-4 cloves of garlic
* 50 gr almonds
* 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 small cayenne pepper
* squeeze of lemon juice
* extra virgin olive oil
* salt and pepper

**Romesco Sauce recipe**

**\[1\]** Preheat the oven to 200C. Place the tomatoes on a roasting tray, alongside the garlic cloves (no need to peel them). Make a cross cut on the tomatoes so that they are easy to peel later on. Roast them for 20-25 min.

**\[2\]** In the meantime, infuse the olive oil in a warm pan with a small cayenne pepper. Toast the almonds on a dry pan over medium-high heat until nice and brown.

**\[3\]** Take the tomatoes and garlic out of the oven. Once they've cooled down, peel them. In a blender, mix the tomatoes, garlic, cayenne oil and almonds, along the spices (smoked paprika + cumin + black pepper), and a squeeze of lemon. 

**\[4\]** Blend everything into a thick sauce, season to taste. Feel free to adjust the quantities of spices according to your taste.

**Cooking the Gnocchi**

5. Add the flour and continue to cook a further 3 minutes.

2021-01-31,2,"Lasagne with Adzuki Beans &amp; Brown Lentils","mienczaczek"," Lasagne is one of my favourite Italian dishes, it always brings a smile to my face. This vegetarian version can easily compete with meat equivalent thanks to a combination of flavours and textures. To make the filling I picked Adzuki beans as their size blends perfectly with lentils and other diced vegetables like onions, peppers and aubergine.

Another amazing thing when it comes to this dish that it is a lot lighter too, making you feel less guilty after eating it :)

**What are Adzuki beans?**

 Adzuki beans are mainly cultivated in East Asia especially in Japan and China, they are small, slightly bigger than a green pea and come in a variety of different colours. Commonly used in a variety of dishes ranging from sweet to savoury. For this recipe, I use a purple variety. You should find them in your local supermarket. If using fresh remember that they need soaking before boiling.

=÷=÷

This recipe makes 6 portions of Lasagne

**Ingredients** **(makes 1 serving)**

* 2 baby bok choy
* 1 green onion
* 2 shiitake mushrooms
* 1 Chinese sausage
* 2 pieces grilled eel
* 1/2 cup white rice (short grain or jasmine are ok)
* 1 cup water
* 1 salted duck egg yolk

**Directions**

1. Prepare all the toppings first. Cut the bok choy into halves. Dice the green onion, slice the shiitake mushrooms and chinese sausage into thin pieces, and cut the eel into whatever formfactor you desire. *As mentioned earlier, you can put anything you like for toppings, but there is a caveat: if you use toppings that shed water as they cook, such as raw meat, you need to reduce the amount of water used to cook the rice. Otherwise, itll end up too soggy. How much to compensate? Thats really hard to tell because different meats shed differing amounts of water. Even the same meat from different sources shed different amounts of water. So, if you use spare ribs for example, youll need to experiment with how much water to remove from the rice.*
2. Wash the rice under cold water twice and drain all excess water.
3. Put the clay pot over a stove and turn on to medium heat. Despite what you may have heard, its possible to make this dish successfully on a gas or electric stove. Ive succeeded many times on both. If you only have an induction stove though, youre out of luck&
4. When the inside of the clay pot gets hot, add \~1tsp oil and swirl it around to coat the bottom.
5. Add the rice into the hot clay pot, and then add in 1 cup of cold water. Cover and continue cooking on medium high heat.
6. As soon as the water boils, open the lid and place in all the toppings EXCEPT the bok choy or any other leafy vegetables you choose. Cover and turn the heat to low and let cook for 12-14 minutes. Now comes the secret to the crispy rice at the bottom. If you want a thinner layer, bias the heat a bit lower and if you want a thicker layer, bias the heat higher. My low heat is not going to be the same as your low heat, so youll likely have to experiment a bit. For a typical electric stove that has dial indicators from 1 to 8, Id use a 2. When in doubt, always bias a little lower so that you dont end up with a burnt mess.
7. While the rice is cooking, in a separate pot, boil some water, add in \~1 tsp oil, and parboil the bok choy for about 1 minute. Then, drain the hot water and shock the bok choy in cold water until its cool to touch. Drain the cold water. The process is the same if you choose to use other leafy greens.
8. Once the 12-14 minutes is up for the rice, remove the lid and check that the rice looks soft but not soggy.
9. Place in the bok choy and put the lid back on. Turn off the flame and let rest for 10 minutes.
10. At the end of the 10 minutes, optionally garnish with green onion. Add in a bit of soy sauce, mix the contents, and enjoy a piping hot clay pot rice.",2917

Pan-seared honey glazed salmon on a bed of collard greens is quick, healthy, garlicky, and lemony. 

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/pan-seared-honey-glazed-salmon/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/pan-seared-honey-glazed-salmon/)

### INGREDIENTS 

#### Collard Greens

* 10-oz bunch of collard greens, central ribs removed and sliced into bite-sized strips
* 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 2 cloves garlic, minced (2 Tbsp)
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1 tsp freshly squeezed lemon juice

#### Salmon

* Two 6-oz salmon steaks (or a 12-oz steak, cut into two after cooking)
* 1 Tbsp honey
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Collard Greens

* Using a non-stick pan, heat extra-virgin olive oil over medium to medium-high heat. 
* Add the chopped collard greens. You want to hear a crackle when they touch the oil. Let it crackle for about 30 seconds, add salt, and stir. 
* Reduce the heat to medium and keep stirring for about 4 minutes. 
* Add red pepper flakes and garlic and stir for another minute or so. Just make sure the garlic doesnt turn brown.
* Remove the collard greens from the pan, squeeze some fresh lemon juice over it, and set aside.

#### Salmon

* Place the salmon steak skin side down on your cutting board and use a paper towel to dry off any excess moisture. 
* Pour honey on top (use your hands or a brush and evenly coat the fishs surface). Add salt and pepper.
* Use a paper towel to wipe clean the pan you used for the collard greens and heat the extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high heat. 
* Add the salmon with the skin side up. Yes, skin side up. That will achieve an incredible sear on the skinless side. Just make sure when you put the fish in the hot pan, do not move it for about 4 minutes.
* Reduce heat and cook for another 4 minutes skin side down, to get the inside just slightly cooked (opaque), with still a little translucency in the center. 
* Place on a bed of collard greens and serve immediately.
* Enjoy!",2157
2021-01-29,15,"10-Minute Garlic Chili Oil Noodles","elle-cookerru","Sharing my favorite quick &amp; easy meal! Thick noodles tossed in an incredibly flavorful sauce, ready in just 10 minutes! Topped with cilantro and green onions, these spicy and garlicky chili oil noodles are so simple to make but packed with so much flavor.

This recipe was inspired by a Chinese dish called You Po Mian (¹üb) which is made by pouring hot oil over aromatics. 

Traditionally, this dish is made with handmade noodles, but I like to use Chinese wide noodles for a simplified version. The ones that Im using for this recipe are Shanxi knife-cut noodles found at a local Asian grocery store (I've shared a photo reference in the link below), which are thick wheat noodles that can be prepared in just 3-4 minutes. 

I personally find that wide knife-cut noodles I find are the best at soaking up all the flavor, making each noodle burst with flavor on each bite. If you dont have this type of noodles on hand though, please feel free to make the noodles from scratch (Biang Biang noodles are an incredible choice) or substitute it with your preferred type of noodles. Enjoy everyone! x

**\[RECIPE (1 SERVING)\]**

**Ingredients:**

* 4 oz thick wheat noodles
* 1 tbsp green onion, chopped, more for garnish
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1-2 tbsp Sichuan chili flakes, adjusted to desired spicy level
* 1 tsp chicken stock powder, or salt
* 2 tsp light soy sauce
* 1 tsp dark soy sauce
* 1/2 tsp chinese black vinegar
* 4 tbsp vegetable oil
* cilantro, green onion, and sesame seeds for garnish

**Directions:**

1. Cook noodles according to package instructions. Drain and place in a bowl. To serve the noodles cold, rinse under cold water for about 1-2 minutes then drain.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a small pot until smoking hot. Add garlic, Sichuan chili flakes, green onion, chicken stock powder, light and dark soy sauce, and Chinese black vinegar on top of the noodles.
3. Pour hot oil immediately over the noodles, aiming towards the chili flakes and garlic. Mix well to combine, adding more soy sauce to taste if needed. Top with chopped cilantro, green onion, and sesame seeds. Enjoy!

**Notes:**

These noodles can be served hot or cold depending on preference. Both ways taste incredible, and the choice is all yours. For cold noodles, you would just need to use a colander to rinse the noodles in cold water for about a minute or two, then drain them of any excess water.

You can also make this vegan by replacing the chicken stock with some salt.

### Instructions

1. Add Oil to pan and turn on medium heat.
2. Add flour and continue to stir, watching close, until the mixture (Roux) has turned a dark chocolate color.F
3. Add Onions, Bell Pepper and Celery and stir until translucent.
4. Add Sausage, mix together for 3 minutes.
5. Add Spices and stir together.
6. Slowly add stock, stirring all the time. Add Bayleaves and fresh Garlic.
7. Turn the heat down to a low roll and cover.
8. Allow to simmer like this for 90 Minutes.
9. While simmering organize rice and any other side dishes.
10. Add Crab, Shrimp, Crab Meat, Green Onion and Parsley and bring back to a boil. Cook on a slow roll for 15 minutes. Turn off heat.

### Notes

If you like a spicier Gumbo replace smoked sausage with andouille sausage, making it 4 Links of Andouille and add another TBSP of Creole Seasoning.

I like to peel about 70% of the shrimp before I put in, this way most won't need peeling while you're eating but you still get the flavor from the shrimp shell from the remaining 30%.

The stock is flexible, you can use all Seafood, or all Chicken - I just like the blend of both.

* While the potatoes are roasting, prepare the chicken. Heat the neutral oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the chicken in an even layercooking in batches if neededskin-side down. Cook without moving for 5 minutes until the skin is very crispy and well-browned. Transfer to a plate and brown the remaining chicken.
* Nestle all the chicken thighs, skin-side up, in the skillet. It's okay if the skillet is a bit crowded since you've already browned the skin. Transfer to the oven with the potatoes and roast for 15 minutes until completely an instant-read thermometer reaches 165ºF.
* You may broil the tops with the potatoes, as well, if you'd like to further crisp up the skin. Remove the chicken from the oven and transfer it to the stove top. Turn off the heat.

## To Serve:

* Right before serving, stir the tomatoes into the avocado salad. Season once more with salt to taste. Slice up the chicken thighs. Divide the cooked rice between shallow bowls and pile the chicken on top. Spoon the avocado salad on the other side of the bowl and arrange one or two butter-roasted potatoes on each plate. Garnish with more minced cilantro, if you like and a spoonful of aji verde.

2021-01-27,70,"Chicken Gyros Kebab with crunchy gherkin salad &amp; oregano garlic sauce","mienczaczek","A long time ago in Krakow, there used to be that place where you could buy Gyros Kebab served in the puffed pitta bread. It is one of those that you start shovelling with your fork and halfway through you grab it with your hands.

Delicious grilled chicken in the very characteristic Greek spice blend, crunchy salad with gherkins, loads of garlic sauce. I tried to recreate that dish and without a shadow of a doubt, I succeeded.

The spice blend you can prepare in advance and store it in the jar. These ingredients should give you enough to make this recipe twice.

**Ingredients for Gyros spice blend:**

* 1tsp mild chilli powder
* 1tsp ground coriander
* 1/2tsp turmeric
* 3tsp oregano
* 1tsp marjoram
* 3tsp paprika
* 1tsp garlic powder
* 1tsp onion powder
* 0,5tsp ground fenugreek
* 1tsp ground mustard seeds
* 1tsp sugar
* 2tsp salt

This recipe makes 4 big portions

**Ingredients for the chicken:**

* 3 big chicken breasts sliced
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* half of the gyros spice blend
* 2 skewers

**Ingredients for the salad and sauce:**

* 1 medium onion sliced
* 2 medium tomatoes diced (sweeter than better)
* half of the small Chinese leaf thinly sliced
* 200g (7oz) of sweet gherkins diced
* 150g (5.3oz) sweetcorn
* 150g (5.3oz) thick yoghurt
* 2tsp mayo
* 1/2tsp oregano
* 1/2tsp black pepper
* 3 garlic cloves minced

**Ingredients for Pitta bread:**

* 350g (12.3oz) strong flour (contains more gluten, this helps to hold shape upon inflation)
* 1tsp baking powder
* 1tsp sugar
* 1tsp salt
* 100ml (0.1quart) milk (you can use water instead)
* 130g (4.6oz) yoghurt
* 50g (1.9oz) melted butter

**Instructions for chicken and salad:**

**1.** Mix the **chicken** with the **olive oil** and **spice blend**, skewer and leave it for minimum **30 minutes** or marinate **overnight**.

**2.** For the sauce mix **yoghurt** with minced **garlic**, **mayonnaise**, **oregano** and **black pepper**.

**3.** Grill the chicken skewers in the oven  250C (482F) for around **10 minutes** then turn upside down and grill for another **10 minutes** (place skewers in a baking dish). When ready take of the skewer and cover with tin foil to keep warm (thighs may need a little longer).

**4.** To serve **cut pitta in half** and stuff with **salad**, **chicken** and **sauce** (pour some of the chicken juice inside for extra flavour).

**Instructions for pitta:**

**1.** For the pitta bread mix all the **dry ingredients** together then **add all the wet**. Mix then knead for around **5 minutes**, until a smooth dough ball is formed. Rest for **30 minutes** covered with bowl or clingfilm.

**2.** Heat the oven to **250C (482F)** for at least **15 minutes** (for the pitta bread you will need to heat bakers stone, cast iron pan or a tray).

**3.** Divide the pitta dough into **four** and roll each one to a **20cm circle** about **2mm thick** (8-inch circle, about 0.08inch thick).

**4.** Place the dough on to the heated baking stone or cast iron pan. Applying heat from the bottom and the top will create puffed pitta, watch it closely not to burn it, this takes around **3,5 minutes**. (Do one at the time, and you may need to heat up your baking surface again before doing another one).

=÷=÷

**Insight:**

* I also like gyros chicken just with gherkin salad.
* If your pitta is not puffed, increase temperature or try to heat the oven for a longer time or roll pittas slightly thicker. You may also need to reheat the stone/cast iron between each pitta.

While you may not see scallops in curry sauce all that often, believe me, these spicy coconut curry scallops are delicious!

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 25 minutes

Total Time: 35 minutes

Servings: 4 as an appetizer

## Equipment

* Wide pot

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 4 Roma tomatoes quartered
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon coconut curry paste (your favorite brand, Thai or Indian style... I used a Thiyal tamarind-coconut curry paste!)
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper optional
* 1 teaspoon chili powder optional
* 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* 1 cup coconut milk
* 1 pound scallops side muscle removed
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Cilantro or parsley leaves optional, for garnish
* Red pepper flakes optional, for garnish

## Instructions

## Char the Tomatoes:

* Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high. Once very hot and shimmering, add the tomatoes, cut-side down, and cook without moving for 3-5 minutes. Once charred, flip and cook an additional 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

## Brown the Curry Paste:

* Melt the butter into the pot and add the coconut paste. Lightly mash it with the back of your spoon and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the crushed red pepper and chili powder, if using, and lightly sauté until fragrant, about 45 seconds.

## Simmer the Sauce:

* Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Taste and season to your preferences. Reduce heat to medium and add the coconut milk. Allow to bubble on medium heat for 10 minutes. Do not allow the sauce to reduce too much or to boil too hard.

## Cook the Scallops:

* While the sauce simmers, pat the scallops dry and remove the side muscle. Season liberally with salt and pepper.
* Gently place the scallops in the broth in an even layer and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 4-5 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the scallops to rest for 1 minute. Remove the lid. If the scallops are opaque, serve immediately. If they need to cook a little longer, cover again and allow the residual heat from the broth to cook them. Do not overcook them!

## To Serve:

* Ladle the coconut curry broth and charred tomatoes into a shallow bowl and arrange the scallops in the broth. Garnish with fresh cracked pepper, red pepper flakes, and herbs like cilantro or parsley leaves, if desired. Serve with cooked basmati rice or naan bread, if desired. Enjoy!

Just as a note - if youre on an electric stove, bring your heat down a few minutes before you add the scallops!!",2635

### INGREDIENTS 

#### Basic No-Knead Bread Ingredients

* 3 c all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp kosher salt
* 3/4 tsp RapidRise instant yeast
* 1-1/2 c warm water

#### Extra Ingredients for Garlic and Herb Bread

* 1 head of garlic
* 1 tsp fresh oregano leaves, finely chopped
* 2 tsp fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped
* 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 tsp Maldon salt (or a flaky sea salt)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Basic No-Knead Bread

* Mix flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. 
* Make a well in the flour mixture and add lukewarm water.
* Mix with a wooden spoon for up to a minute, until the dough becomes too sticky to be pancake batter but too runny to be playdough. 
* Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and set it in a nice warm place in your house. After about 6  8 hours, the dough should have doubled in size. 
* Either lightly flour a piece of parchment paper or use a silicone mat and slide the dough onto it. 
* Punch down the dough and gently fold it a couple times.
* Form it into a ball (sprinkle some flour on your hands if its too sticky) and cover with a towel. Let rise for another 1-1/2 hours. 
* Start preheating the oven about 30 minutes before the dough is ready. Line the Dutch oven with parchment paper and place it (with the lid on) in the oven (on the middle rack) while preheating. 
* When the oven lets you know it has reached 425	, take the really, really hot Dutch oven out. 
* Place the dough into the Dutch oven, put the lid back on, and then put it back in the oven.
* Thirty minutes later, remove the lid and let it bake for another 20 minutes or until its nicely browned. 
* Let cool completely on a rack and enjoy!

#### Extra Steps for Garlic and Herb Bread

* First, follow steps 1 through 4 as above in the Basic No-Knead Bread Instructions.
* Toward the end of the first dough rise, grab a whole head of garlic and rub in your hands to remove the excess papery skins.
* Chop off the top to expose the cloves and tightly wrap in aluminum foil. 
* Roast in the oven at 400ºF for about 30 minutes. 
* After the garlic has cooled off, remove the tender garlic cloves from the bulb and roughly chop them.
* After the first dough rise, either lightly flour a piece of parchment paper or use a silicone mat and slide the dough onto it. 
* Punch down the dough, add the garlic, oregano, and rosemary on top, and gently fold it into the dough a couple of times. 
* Follow steps 7, 8, and 9 as above in the Basic No-Knead Bread Instructions.
* Thirty minutes later, remove the lid, drizzle the loaf with the olive oil and sprinkle with the Maldon salt.
* Bake for another 20 minutes or until its nicely browned. 
* Let cool completely on a rack and enjoy!",3006

* Garlic Powder, 1 tbsp
* Cajun Seasoning, 1 tbsp (Tony Cachere's)

### Instructions

1. Soak live crawfish in water for about 1/2 hour, removing dead crawfish. Drain and soak again for a further 1/2 hour.
2. Bring large pot of water to boil.
3. While crawfish are soaking prepare vegetables - chop carrots into long pieces. Cut onions in half. Chop sausage into long pieces.
4. Add 2 cups of crab boil to water.
5. Put potatoes, garlic, onions, carrots and sausage into basket and drop into the water. Boil for 10 minutes. Add corn and mushrooms and cook for another 10 minutes.
6. Take vegetables out and put into ice chest to keep warm.
7. Add another 8 cups of crab boil to the water, to boil the crawfish in.
8. Dump crawfish into basket (that the veggies were in) and when the water is back boiling drop the crawfish.
9. Cook crawfish for 4 minutes (timed once the water gets to boiling point again).
10. Turn off heat and allow crawfish to soak in the pot for a further 10 minutes.

2021-01-26,3,"Polish Tea Cookies (Thumbprint Cookies), Gluten and Diary Free","junkei","**RECIPE**

Because of gastrointestinal issues Im unable to consume dairy/gluten, so I altered a pretty standard version of the recipe many of my relatives (American Polish) use. 

Theyre pretty simple and easy, but great as a snack with tea!

You can use oils other than canola, I just prefer it for baking as I feel it works best to complement gluten free recipes. 

I use Earth Balance vegan butter and Bobs Red Mill 1-to-1 Baking Flour. Im sure there are better options, these are just the best/cheapest I have available.

**Ingredients**

-	1/2 cup vegan butter
-	1-2 tbsp canola oil
-	1/2 cup sugar
-	1 egg 
-	1 cup gluten free flour
-	1/2 tsp salt 
-	1 tsp vanilla
-	1 jar of jam/preserves of your choice (usually raspberry)
-	1/4 cup of icing sugar 
-	Optional: chopped nuts of your choice ~1/4 cup

**Directions**

-	Combine the flour and the salt and set it aside
-	Slightly melt the butter. Add in the sugar and cream it with a mixer (or just a whisk and some hard work if you dont have one).
-	Separate the yolk of the egg, slightly beat it and then add it to the mixer. Beat the egg white until foamy, but set it aside.
-	Add the vanilla and mix well. 
-	And the flour and salt mixture, as well as 1tbsp of canola oil and mix all of the ingredients well. The canola oil helps mitigate the dryness of gluten free flour and vegan butter, so if the dough is still too dry add a little more oil. 
-	Optional: if you would like to add nuts, fold them in here. Personally, I used about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans. 
-	Preheat the oven to 350°F
-	Roll the dough into small balls (14-18)
-	Dip each ball into the beaten egg whites 
-	Place balls onto a greased cookie sheet (or parchment paper)
-	Gently press down the center of each with your thumb. 
-	Bake at 350 for 5 minutes
-	Remove from the oven and carefully (they will be hot) repress the centers again
-	Put your jam/preserves inside the thumb print before placing back in the oven. Use just enough to fill the thumbprint. Personally, I used boysenberry preserves (preserves add a little more texture than jam)
-	Bake an additional 10 - 15 mins. When done, they will be golden on bottom and lightly around the top. 
-	Sprinkle (ideally with a sieve) icing sugar overtop and let rest until cool (this is very important as the cookie will fall apart if you attempt to move/eat them before they fully cool and set)",2379

1 28-oz. Can San Marzano Tomatoes

1 Tbsp. Tomato Paste

2 Tbsp. Salted Butter

Oregano, Dried Oregano, Red Pepper Flakes, Salt &amp; Pepper, to taste

Parmesan Cheese &amp; Black Pepper for topping

Steps

Sauce:

1. In a large pan with high sides, (or a dutch oven), melt butter over medium-high heat.

2. Once butter is melted, add diced onion and stir to coat with butter. Add a pinch of salt, cook onion until soft and translucent, stirring semi-frequently, about 5-10 minutes.

3. Once the onion is cooked, add garlic to an open space in the pot and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly browned and fragrant. Once lightly browned, stir together with the onion.

4. Push onion and garlic mixture to the edge of the pan and add the ground beef or lamb. Break up the meat with a wooden spoon, season with more salt, and cook until no pink remains.

5. Once the meat is cooked, reduce the heat to medium then add tomato paste, grated carrot, and canned tomatoes. Stir to fully combine.

6. Add herbs and spices to your liking, (about a teaspoon of each to start), and stir to combine.

7. Allow sauce to simmer, and once the sauce has been reduced slightly, (less watery liquid), turn the heat to low and keep covered while you prepare the pasta. (I recommend lifting the lid occasionally to give a quick stir. Also, taste a small amount of the sauce and adjust the seasoning to your liking, such as adding more salt, pepper, basil, etc.)

Pasta &amp; Assembly:

1. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat.

2. Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add a generous amount of salt and stir to combine.

3. Add pasta and cook al dente according to box directions, stirring occasionally.

4. With about half a minute left in the pastas cook time, reserve a small amount, (roughly half a cup), of the pasta water and set it aside.

5. Drain pasta then immediately add to the pan with sauce. Toss to combine. (When combining the pasta and the sauce, slowly drizzle in some of the pasta water to help the sauce bind to the pasta. You dont need to use all of what youve set aside, but its better to have too much reserved than too little.)

6. Remove the pan from the heat and serve. Either transfer to a large serving dish or serve into bowls straight from the pan.

7. Top with grated parmesan and a few grinds of black pepper.

8. Enjoy! :)",2664

3. Place a parchment paper round atop the liquid in the pot, or partially cover the pot with a lid, and let cook until the beans are fully tender, to 2 hours. (At this point you can cool and store the beans and their liquid until ready to assemble the dish.)

4. In a large pot or high-sided skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. 

5. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until some of the fat has been rendered and the meat is browned. 

6. Add the chorizo and cook, stirring often and breaking up the meat as you cook, until the meat is heated through, about 5 minutes,

7. Quickly whisk the eggs in a medium bowl, then pour them into the chorizo mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggs are just set and no longer runny. 

8. Stir in the beans and their liquid, making sure there is enough liquid to cover all of the ingredients (if not, add a little more water). Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmers let cook for 5 minutes for the flavors to blend.

2021-01-24,4,"Strawberry Milk Cake","spamantha","#**Strawberry milk cream cheese filling:**

* 2 blocks (16oz) of cream cheese, room temp
* 2 sticks of butter (temp doesn't matter at first, you'll see why)
* 0.75 cups Nesquick strawberry milk powder
* 60g water
* 600g powdered sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla extract (or paste)
* 1/4 tsp table salt
* pink food coloring, if you want

***Directions:***

1. Okay so first we need to make the strawberry milk butter. Put your sticks of butter, your water, and your Nesquick powder in a saucepan over like medium heat. Sugar won't dissolve in fat, so you need the water to dissolve the Nesquick powder. But we don't want the water in there, so once the Nesquick powder is dissolved and no longer granular, we need to boil the water back out of it. This seems complicated, it's really not, but I'm not sure how else to explain it. Get it back to...melted butter consistency. Pour into a heatproof bowl, put it on the counter, get it to room temp. Now you have softened, room-temp strawberry milk butter. Onto the real recipe.
1. In your stand mixer bowl with a paddle or whisk, add the cream cheese and the strawberry milk butter you made. Beat it on high until it's smooth and creamy.
1. Slowly add in the powdered sugar, don't plume it into your kitchen, just be gentle and go slow.
1. When that's all mixed, add in the salt and the vanilla, then beat it on high for about 2 minutes. Adjust the powdered sugar (by adding more) if your frosting doesn't look thick enough.
1. Dye it to whatever color you want, go nuts.

*(note: you can make this ahead of time, just keep it in a container in the fridge and re-whip it before you go to use it)*

#**Strawberry milk Swiss meringue buttercream:**

* 0.75 cups Nesquick strawberry milk powder
* granulated sugar (amount will make sense in the directions, you need a scale)
* 115g egg whites (from a carton is fine, as long as it can hold stiff peaks when you beat it alone)
* 0.5 tsp table salt
* 0.5 tsp vanilla extract (or paste)
* 3 sticks + 3 tbsp unsalted butter, room temp but ideally like 65F
* pink food coloring, if you want

***Directions:***

I'm gonna be real with you, you need a scale for this part specifically here:

1. Put your metal stand mixer bowl on a scale, zero it out. Add 0.75 cups of Nesquick strawberry milk powder, and then add regular granulated sugar to it until it reaches 210 grams. You could go to 250 if you wanted it sweeter, but keep in mind the cream cheese frosting and cake are also super sweet.
1. Add the egg whites, salt, and vanilla to the same bowl.
1. Get a small pot, some size that your stand mixer bowl doesn't touch the bottom of the pot, and fill it with an inch or two of water. Put it on medium/medium-high, place your metal stand mixer bowl on top of it.
1. Go put the whisk attachment on your stand mixer and get it ready to put the bowl on to mix.
1. Stir the mixture over the double boiler for about 12-15 minutes, until it holds steady at 185F when a probe thermometer is inserted in it.
1. Put your mixing bowl immediately on your stand mixer, increase the speed until you hit medium-high/high, and walk away for like 10/15 minutes (or more). In the meantime, cut your butter into 1 tbsp chunks.
1. You're ready for the next step when your stand mixer bowl feels not warm to the touch anymore, or if an infrared or probe thermometer shows the mixture is around 90F. If for some reason after like 25 minutes and your mixer is hot and angry (like mine), your mixture doesn't come down that low, Swiss meringue buttercream is incredibly forgiving and can be fixed with temperature adjustments later. You can give your mixer a break and pop it in the fridge, or just leave it out. Stella Parks' [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/05/swiss-meringue-buttercream-frosting-recipe.html) on Serious Eats for her Swiss Meringue Buttercream is the basis for this recipe and has a great writeup on troubleshooting your buttercream after you add your butter.
1. Add the butter with the mixer still on medium-high/high, one tablespoon at a time, making sure you don't see any butter in the mixture before adding another tablespoon. Repeat until all the butter is gone, it should be big and lofty and fluffy.
1. It'll be super pale pink, you can add more with food coloring if you want to make it whatever color you want.

*(note: you can also make this ahead of time, just keep it in a container in the fridge and re-whip it before use)*

#**Strawberry milk meringues**

If you want to make the Strawberry milk meringues you see on top, there's a thread on /r/AskBaking in my comment history where I post the recipe for it. You can dip them in tempered white chocolate/candy melts so they don't melt from the moisture on the cake.

---

Now you're finally ready to assemble your cake once you have all the components done! This took me 5 days total to put together and make all the components because I don't like marathon baking and it stresses me out. You do you though.

#**Assembly:**

* Cake layers, cut in half horizontally
* Strawberry milk cream cheese frosting
* Bakers Choice white chocolate balls (optional, but adds texture)
* A small glass of strawberry milk, made according to package directions on the Nesquick box
* Piping bag with a 1A tip or equivalent, filled with the cream cheese frosting
* Offset spatula
* Cake turntable (had never made a cake with one before, wow, a game-changer, worth the $15, but optional)
* Strawberry swiss meringue buttercream
* Approximately 17 mini strawberry Japanese Kit Kats, found on Amazon or your local Asian mart if you're lucky
* Approximately 102 strawberry Pocky, 3 75g boxes with some extra
* 10-inch cake board, optional but super handy for transfer

***Directions:***

1. Put your cake board on the turntable, add your first half layer, cut side up. You can add some frosting to secure it to the cake board, but I found it was unnecessary for this cake.
1. Dab with a brush your strawberry milk over the entire layer.
1. Pipe cream cheese frosting around the outside edge of the layer, spiral it around the inside to cover, and then smooth it with your offset spatula.
1. Sprinkle with your white chocolate balls, more than you'd think if you want it to be a true textural contrast, I didn't put enough on I don't think.
1. Put your next layer on top, cut side up, making sure it's in the center.
1. Repeat steps 2-5 two more times.
1. Put the final layer on, cut side down. Spread the rest of the cream cheese frosting in a very thin layer over the whole cake to crumb coat it, and put it in your fridge for about 45 minutes to set.
1. Take your cake out of the fridge, and starting with the sides, add your swiss meringue buttercream. Add more than you think, it's much easier to take it away than to add more to a section. Don't worry about smoothing it too much until you're at the end of covering the cake. Smooth it out.
1. Making sure the Kit Kats are right side up, put a line of them all the way around the outside of the cake at the bottom.
1. Add the Pocky. I did 6 Pocky per Kit Kat, and because I'm anal, I made sure they were all facing the same way.
1. Decorate the top as you'd like!

2021-01-24,12,"Beef Bourguignon, lets get winter cozy!","mienczaczek","A few years ago, me and my family had a pleasure to visit France for a holiday. During our stay in the small village of Saint-Martin-de-Bavel, we visited the local restaurant for the dinner and one of the dishes that I tried was Beef Bourguignon over boiled potatoes. I loved the simplicity of the dish and the complexity of the flavour that comes with it. I asked about a few tips of cooking this dish and their secret was to marinate the beef overnight. Back home I tried to recreate this dish and this is the recipe I want to share with you.

This recipe makes 4 portions

Marinating time: 1 day

Cooking time 3,5 hours

**Ingredients for marinade:**

* 500g Diced Beef chuck or other stewing cut
* half bottle of Burgundy red wine (if not available you can use other red wine too)
* 1 banana shallot finely diced
* bunch of fresh thyme, chopped
* 2 bay leaves
* 1/2tsp of black pepper

**Ingredients for stew:**

* 100g of lardons
* 200g button mushrooms cut in half
* 15 pearl onions
* 2 medium carrots cut to half rings
* half a stick of celery, finely diced
* 4 garlic cloves
* 25g of butter
* 300ml of beef stock
* extra hot water to be added during cooking (to compensate liquid evaporation)
* 1tbsp of cornflour dissolved in 2tbsp of water
* 1tbsp oil
* Parsley to garnish
* Boiled potatoes or pasta to serve

=÷=÷

**Instructions:**

1. Begin by marinating diced beef. Mix it in a bowl with finely diced shallot, a small bunch of fresh chopped thyme, 2 bay leaves, 1/2tsp of black pepper and half a bottle of Burgundy red wine. Leave it covered in the fridge overnight.
2. On the next day, remove the beef pieces from the marinade and pat them dry ready to be seared **(keep the marinade).**
3. To sear the beef mix it with 1tbsp of oil and pan-fry over high heat to colour the meat on each side (do it in two batches if your pan is small or you preparing a bigger amount).
4. Add in the marinade liquid with all the bits plus 300ml of beef stock, bring it to the temperature and **simmer for 2,5 hours** (during that time the liquid will evaporate so keep adding more water to keep the meat almost covered).
5. In the meantime prepare bacon and vegetables. In a separate pan, fry bacon lardons until the fat have rendered out, then add the mushrooms and fry until they start to brown. Next, add pearl onions with 25g of butter. Once melted add carrots and celery. Once browned transfer everything onto a plate ready for later.
6. **After 2,5 hours** beef will start to tenderise, at this point add bacon with vegetables and simmer for **1 more hour** (**during that time the liquid should reduce by half**).
7. Once Beef Bourguignon is ready you can thicken the sauce if needed with 1tbsp of cornflour dissolved in 2tbsp of water. Don't forget to check and adjust the seasoning.
8. Serve over buttery boiled potatoes or pasta.

* Drain and press firm tofu. In a large mixing bowl, mix black pepper, cornstarch, oil, and soy sauce. Toss in tofu and generously coat with mixture. Bake in oven for 30 minutes or until crispy (if your tofu is too wet, it wont crisp up!)
* Mix the gochujang, water, soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil, grated ginger, and minced garlic in a shallow saucepan and simmer. Create a cornstarch slurry with 1 tablespoon cornstarch and 2 tablespoon water. Pour into gochujang mixture and stir until the sauce thickens. Keep your eye on the sauce as you dont want it to stick to the pan.
* Throw the baked tofu in the sauce and coat generously. Toss lightly so its all covered.
* Serve with white rice and top with some chopped scallions and white sesame seeds.

## Notes

Remember, the key to crispy and flavorful tofu is to drain and press your tofu. You want to squeeze as much liquid out as possible.

2021-01-23,3,"Fish Sauce Caramel Flan","grubbingwithguber","I'm very excited to share with y'all my favorite creation!

Growing up as a Vietnamese, I use fish sauce liberally in most of my food. Interestingly, a lot of chefs also use fish sauce in non-Asian food as well to enhance the umami flavor. If used right, fish sauce helps elevate a lot of different flavors in a dish without bringing out the ""fishy"" smell/taste.

This creation is inspired by a very popular Vietnamese dish called ""Xoài ch¥m m¯m °Ýng"" (Unripened Mango with Sweetened Fish Sauce). The fish sauce in this dish brings out a unique taste to both the mango and sugar. Similarly, the addition of fish sauce to the traditional ""Caramel Flan"" helps enhance the subtle egg flavor of flan while the lime slightly dampens the funk yet elevates the whole dish to a whole new level.

People said ""don't judge a book by it's cover"", and I can guarantee you that this dish is a prime example of that. It was a big struggle for me to stop myself from eating all of these at once, but no regrets!

# Ingredients

Serving Size: 6 flans

Fish Sauce Caramel Sauce

* 1 cup of palm sugar or granulated sugar
* 1/8 tsp of cream of tartar
* 3 tbsp of water
* 4 tbsp of unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup of room temperature heavy cream
* 1 &amp; 1/2 tbsp of high quality fish sauce
* 1 lime

Flan

* 1/3 cup of granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup of heavy cream
* 1 cup of half and half
* 1 &amp; 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract

# Recipe

* In a heavy saucepan, combine 1 cup of palm sugar, 3 tbsp of water, and 1/8 tsp of cream of tartar. Heat on medium, stir until everything is well combined. Once the mixture comes to a rapid boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking, swirling the pan occasionally. Brush down the side of the heavy saucepan with a wet pastry brush to prevent crystallization.
* After about 7-10 minutes, the syrup will start to darken into an amber color. Continue to cook until it turns into a dark amber color, then add 4 tbsp of butter, around 1 tbsp at a time, swirling constantly. Be careful, the mixture will start to sputter as soon as you add the butter. After the butter is mixed, continue to stir constantly, and gradually add 1/2 cup of room temperature heavy cream into the mixture. After everything is well mixed, take the caramel off the heat. Add 1 &amp; 1/2 tbsp of your favorite fish sauce, zest of 1 lime, and juice from a wedge of lime. Give it a little stir and set it aside.
* In a medium bowl, combine 1/3 of cup of granulated sugar and 2 large eggs. Gently whisk until everything is well combined, making sure to not create so much air. Then add 1 cup of heavy cream, 1 cup of half and half, and 1 &amp; 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. Then continue to gently whisk the mixture to combine everything together. Then let it sit for around 5 minutes for the sugar to dissolve and for the air to pop.
* Preheat the oven to 325oF.
* Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to completely eliminate all the air pockets. Once thats done, set it aside.
* Place around 6 ramekins in a roasting pan. Fill the bottom of the ramekins with the delicious fish sauce caramel, around 1 &amp; 1/2 tsp per ramekin. Then carefully fill the ramekins with the custard mixture. Then fill the pan with hot water, up to around 1 inch. Then cover the pan with aluminum foil, making sure to seal the edges. Once everything is done, carefully place it in the oven for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, rotate the pan, and continue cooking for another 20 minutes. Once 45 minutes has passed, take the pan out, remove the aluminum foil, and let them sit in the pan for an extra 30 minutes.
* After 30 minutes, remove the ramekins from the pan and cool it completely in the fridge, preferably overnight.
* Take out a ramekin, place a small knife along the inside edge of the ramekin and rotate to loosen up the flan. Place a plate over the ramekin, turn it upside down, give the bottom and sides a little pat, and there you have it!",3994

You can find more photos and step by step instructions [here](https://nerdswithknives.com/gingery-chicken-rice-noodle-soup-garlic/). 

Serves 4

Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons neutral oil, divided
* 5 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced 
* 3 large shallots, peeled and thinly sliced
* 3-inch piece ginger, peeled and thinly sliced into planks
* 1/4 cup hoisin sauce
* 2 quarts low sodium chicken stock or water
* 2 pounds chicken thighs or breasts (boneless or bone-in, skin removed, if desired)
* 4 scallions, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated
* 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
* 8 ounces rice noodles (recommended: vermicelli)
* Kosher salt and soy sauce, to taste

Optional garnishes

* 1 lightly packed cup fresh cilantro, torn
* 1 lime, quartered, for squeezing
* Chili-garlic paste or chili crisp

Directions

1. Cook your rice noodles according to the package directions. Rinse them with warm water and set them aside.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil and the garlic to a large pot and turn the heat on medium-low. Keep moving the garlic around as it starts to sizzle, turning it often until it turns light golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes once the oil is hot. Remove it to a plate with a slotted spoon and set it aside.
3. Turn the heat to medium, add the last tablespoon of oil to the pot and add the shallots and ginger. Cook, stirring often, until the shallots are soft and lightly browned in spots, about 5 minutes. Add the hoisin and cook it for about 1 minute. Add the stock or water and bring it to a boil, then turn the heat down to a simmer, add the chicken pieces and scallion whites and cook until chicken is cooked through and tender. The thickest part of the chicken should register about 160°F on an instant read thermometer. Boneless breasts may take about 10 to 15 minutes, large bone-in thighs may need 25 to 30 minutes. Turn the heat off, remove the chicken to a plate and use two forks to shred the meat, discarding the skin and bones if needed. If there is a layer of fat on top of the broth, you can remove it with a spoon, if desired. Remove and discard the ginger, return the shredded chicken to the pot and stir in the sesame oil and scallion greens.

This is a traditional must-have dish for Lunar New Year, tied to many auspicious sayings and superstitions.","madewithlau","I'm very excited to share a traditional dish that always adorns our dinner table during Lunar New Year!

We'll be covering:

* How to poach a perfect, juicy **White Cut Chicken**
* How to make my dads addictive **Ginger Scallion sauce**
* The traditional Chinese way to **carve and plate a chicken** from head to toe
* The various Chinese idioms / meanings tied to whole chicken

Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/PIX8it0BIao) if you want to follow a visual :)

# Superstition: Chicken

In Chinese tradition, chicken is intertwined with many sayings and superstitions of good fortune, wealth, and resilience.

Even though my parents didn't have much meat growing up in China, this is one of the dishes my parents always ate on Lunar New Year's eve and other festivities.

Especially with auspicious foods, Chinese superstition involves a lot of creative word-play. The word for chicken, gi in Cantonese and j+ in Mandarin, sounds like several words of good fortune.

Just to name a few phrases that my parents shared with us:

* hóu sai gaai }L - A Cantonese phrase that roughly translates to good world, good life.
* dàjídàlì '	') - A Mandarin phrase that roughly translates to great luck, great profit.
* yáuh tàuh yáuh méih 	4	> - A Cantonese phrase that literally translates to: ""has a head, has a tail."" It means ""good beginning, good ending."" This is one of the reasons why it's important to make a whole chicken for Lunar New Year.
* jáau pàh jáau wàh Rõ - A Toisanese phrase, related to eating the chicken legs, that roughly means ""face all challenges with persistence.""

So, basically, eat a whole chicken if you want to live. (jk)

## The Recipe

Main Ingredients

* 4 lb **whole chicken** (traditionally for Lunar New Year, the chicken has its head &amp; feet intact)
* 2 oz **green onion**
* 1.5 oz **ginger**
* 5 tbsp **corn oil**

Additional Flavor &amp; Seasoning

* 1 tsp **salt** (for boiling water)
* 2 tsp **salt** (for ginger scallion sauce)
* 1 tbsp **sesame oil**

# Step 1 - Boil water, add salt

Set the stove to high heat and start boiling a generous amount of water in the pot you'll be using.

We'll want to be able to fully submerge our chicken in the water to make sure it cooks evenly.

We'll also be adding **1 teaspoon of salt**. My dad says not to add too much here.

# Step 2 - Prepare &amp; cook chicken

* Wait for the water to come to a boil.

We'll be doing a couple of things in this step, mostly to ensure that the entire chicken is cooked evenly for maximum tenderness.

* **Pierce a hole in the skin in the neck -** This helps the water flow through the chicken cavity to help it cook more evenly.
* **Stretch the legs away from the body several times -** This helps to avoid having a big clump of chicken meat that's undercooked.
* **Slowly dip the chicken 3 times in the boiling water -** This helps even out the temperatures on the inside of the cavity and on the exterior of the chicken. Make sure the water is already boiling before you do this.
* **Add the chicken and make sure it's completely submerged -** If you have to add more boiling water, do it.

From here, we'll cover the pot.

Here's a rough heat / timing overview:

* Once the pot's been covered, leave it on high heat for 5 minutes as the water comes to a boil again.
* Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for another 35-40 minutes. The larger the chicken, the longer you cook it. The sweet spot is 4 pounds.
* Check if it's done. If so, transfer it to an ice bath. (More on both of these later.)

# Step 3 - Mince scallions and ginger

While we wait for the chicken to cook, we'll start on our sauce by mincing our **green onions** (2 oz) and **ginger** (1.5 oz).

My dad said the exact ratio and amounts don't matter too much. Most recipes I've seen use more scallions than ginger.

Having a surplus of sauce is a great problem to have, since you can use it on pretty much everything. (I LOVE dousing my rice and vegetables in this addictive sauce)

For the green onions, we'll be using the white stems (about 4 stems at the default serving size). Cut each stem in half, length-wise, and then into strips. Then, mince the strips into fine pieces.

For the ginger, we'll be cutting them into thin slices, strips, and then fine pieces.

My dad is using separate plates to hold the green onions and ginger. The ginger will be cooked first in the next step, so this makes it easier to separate.

Also, feel free to use a food processor here instead of mincing.

# Step 4 - Heat oil, cook ginger scallions

We'll heat up our wok on high heat and add **corn oil** (5 tbsp).

The oil should be around 350-400F before we add the ginger.

A good visual cue is to wait until the oil starts ""shimmering"", or forming ripples across the surface due to the heat.

Why do we do this? By cooking everything in oil, we unlock the aromatics of the ginger and green onion.

Once the oil is hot enough, add the ginger and cook for about 15 seconds before adding the green onions. Cook everything for another 20-30 seconds before transferring the sauce to a bowl.

# Step 5 - Flavor the sauce

We'll add **salt** (2 tsp) and **sesame oil** (1 tbsp) to the bowl, and mix for 30-60 seconds.

Do a taste test and adjust if necessary. My dad emphasized multiple times how important it is to add sesame oil here, so make sure you don't skip it.

# Step 6 - Prepare an ice bath

Grab a big bowl and dump a few handfuls of ice into it. Fill it roughly halfway with cold water.

The ice bath is very important - once the chicken is done cooking, we need to immediately cool it down.

Why is this so important?

* **It helps the meat contract and locks the juices inside - I**f we skip this step, juices will flood out as we chop the chicken into pieces.
* **It helps the skin stay attached -** Without this step, we'll have a bunch of loose pieces of skin everywhere.
* **It gives the skin a bit more of a chewy texture**

# Step 7 - Determine if the chicken is done

Once the time draws near, we can uncover the pot. Poke the thickest part of the chicken (around the thigh) deeply with a chopstick.

If blood or red fluid leaks out, we need to cook it for a few more minutes.

If the fluid is clear, it's ready for the ice bath.

Feel free to use your newfound chicken broth however you'd like. In the video, my dad created two additional dishes (a soup and a veggie) out of it by boiling bok choy with some ginger.

# Step 8 - Lift and transfer to ice bath

Carefully take two chopsticks under the chicken wings, and lift it over the pot.

Suspend it over the pot for 30-45 seconds to let some of the residual water drip out.

Then, carefully transfer it into the ice bath. Prepare for a splash!

Let the chicken sit in the bath for 5 minutes, occasionally pouring water over the surface of the chicken and rotating the chicken in the container.

# Step 9 - Carve the chicken

* This could honestly be its own post, but for now it will live in a very detailed step in this recipe.

This is a lot easier to follow in our YouTube video, where we dedicate about 6 minutes of time to this segment.

There are a few things to keep in mind before you start.

* My dads done this hundreds of times, and it took him about 10 minutes from start to finish. Itll probably take a lot longer if youre a beginner like me, but the main thing is just to make sure your cleaver is sharp and that youre moving carefully and deliberately. 
* If you dont already have a cleaver, its still technically possible, but I highly recommend getting one if you plan on making this dish. Here are some options:
   * Dexter Russell Heavy Duty Cleaver 
   * Saamhangnga Cleaver 
* For easier, safer cutting, you should use a larger, thicker cutting board thats preferably made of wood, and you should place a moist towel underneath it to increase its stability.

How to plate, according to Chinese tradition:

* Basically everything is plated - even parts that aren't readily edible like the head.
* Each piece of chicken is laid out on a large plate according to where it was on its body, head to toe, right to left.
* You'll often see this served on a large oval-shaped plate.

Order of operations:

* Cut off the neck and feet, cut into small pieces
* Cut and place the head and butt at opposite ends of the middle axis of the plate
* Remove the wings and thighs
* Cut and split the torso into two halves (front and back)
* Split the back in half, and cut it into pieces
* Cut and pry away the breast bone, and cut it into pieces
* Cut the thighs and wings into small pieces

Cutting techniques:

* A technique my dad uses a lot involves making a shallow slice to wedge the cleaver, and then hitting down on the blade with our palm to drive the blade through the bone. 
* In our recent knife skills interview, my dad talked about the 3 different parts of the blade - the root, the belly, and the tip. When chopping through bone, he always makes contact with the root, or the part of the blade closest to the handle. 

When I first started this project, documenting how my dad carves a chicken was high on the list of traditions I wanted to learn and share. It always feels like Im watching an artist at work when I see my dad gracefully chop and plate everything. 

Every cut has an intention, and every piece has a place. Almost everything goes on the plate, and nothing is wasted. Especially for Lunar New Year and other celebrations, bak chit gai is meant to be one of the main decorative centerpieces on the dinner table, and carving it up into beautiful bite-sized pieces is an honor that I hope to take on one day for my own family.

2021-01-19,50,"French Vanilla marshmallows made from egg yolks","Fluffy_Munchkin","Ok! I have two current recipe variations, I'll tell you the differences between the two. Note that you can easily cut the recipe in half if you're just looking to try them out first, and are concerned about making more than you need.

**Pate a Bombe Marshyellows:**

14g gelatin +70g cold water

180g sugar

100g corn syrup

80g water

100g egg yolk

4g salt

1tbsp vanilla extract (or seeds of 1 vanilla bean)

Bloom the gelatin in the cold water for 5-10 minutes. Add sugar, corn syrup, and the other water quantity to a saucepan and heat on medium. Meanwhile, beat egg yolks and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer on low speed with a whisk attachment.

Heat sugar syrup to 242F/116.5C, turn mixer speed to high, and drizzle syrup into the side of the mixer bowl. Beat on high for several minutes, until mixture is cooled significantly and has increased in volume and is pale in color. In the same saucepan, gently melt bloomed gelatin, and add to the mixture, in addition to the vanilla. Beat for five minutes, then spread mixture into a greased loaf pan. Allow to dry for 8 hours minimum (preferably...16, I think). 

Dust a cutting board with an equal mixture of corn starch and powdered sugar (25g each should be sufficient). Unmold marshmallow slab, dust the top, and cut into cubes. Toss cubes in remaining sugar/cornstarch mix.

**Option 2:**

These marshyellows should have a better texture than the original, but they're still on the softer side. Here's the other option:

100g egg yolk

14g gelatin

4g salt

20g cold water

180g sugar

100g corn syrup

80g water

1tbsp vanilla (or seeds of one bean)

The procedure is identical as the Pate a Bombe method, with the following important distinction: 

Combine yolks, cold water, salt, and gelatin in the bowl of the stand mixer, and let sit for 5-10 minutes to bloom. Once the sugar syrup is added, beat for five minutes, then pour into a greased pan.

NOTE: This recipe doesn't use the pate a bombe method, and instead relies on the yolks' water content to help bloom the gelatin. This allowed me to decrease the marshyellow's overall hydration, and the texture should be much different: firmer, with more chew and structure. 

**HOWEVER!** This method gives you little bits of solidified yolk (basically candied yolk, same flavor as the rest of the mallow) interspersed throughout the marshmallow. I think it has to do with the gelatin emulsifying parts of the yolk, causing bits to denature when heated, and not dissolve in the mixture. I still need to develop this further and see if I can prevent this from happening, because I do prefer the texture of this method to the original.",2647

2 cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

½ teaspoon kosher salt

¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature

¾ cup sugar

3 tablespoons honey

¾ cup tahini

¼ cup toasted sesame seeds

Step 1

Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 350°. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter, sugar, and honey in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in tahini, then add dry ingredients in 2 batches, beating after each addition until fully combined. Dough will be slightly sticky.

Step 2

Place sesame seeds in a small bowl. Scoop out heaping tablespoons of dough (about 1 oz.) and roll into balls. Dip tops of balls in sesame seeds, pressing to adhere, and place, sesame side up, on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing about 2"" apart. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until golden brown, 1315 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets (cookies will firm as they cool).",1282

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask or refer to [this video](https://youtu.be/42OkzLY1q4A).

&amp;nbsp;

**INGREDIENTS**

**Chashu:**

* 2-2½ lb pork belly block (roughly 8"" x 9"", 20 cm x 23 cm)
* 2-3 green onions
* 1 knob ginger
* 1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc.)
* 1 cup sake
* 1 cup soy sauce
* 2 cups water
* T cup sugar

**Ramen Eggs:**
* 4 or more eggs
* Leftover chashu braising liquid

**Pizza Dough:**
* 2 - 2 1/3 cups (250 - 295g) bread flour or all-purpose flour, divided
* 1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) instant yeast
* 1 1/2 tsp sugar
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1/8 - 1/4 tsp garlic powder and/or dried basil (optional)
* 2 Tbsp olive oil (+ extra for greasing)
* 3/4 cup (175ml) warm water
* Cornmeal

**Miso Ramen Broth:**
* 2 cloves (~1 ½ tsp) garlic
* 1 knob (~½ tsp) ginger
* 1 shallot
* 1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds
* 1 Tbsp roasted sesame oil 
* ¼ lb ground pork, plus more if you want your broth to be meatier/chunkier 
* 1 tsp doubanjiang (spicy or non-spicy broad bean paste)
* 3 Tbsp miso
* 1 Tbsp sugar
* 1 Tbsp sake
* 4 cups chicken stock/broth
* 1 tsp kosher/sea salt
* ¼ tsp white pepper powder

**Ramen Pizza:**
* 1 12"" pizza dough
* 1/4 cup miso ramen broth
* 1/4 cup pizza sauce
* 1/2 lb full-fat, low-moisture mozzarella, shredded
* Chashu, cut into bite-size pieces
* Ramen eggs, sliced in half
* Ramen noodles (dry or fresh)

&amp;nbsp;

**METHOD**

**Chashu:**

1. Roll up the pork belly, making sure one or both ends should have the bacon like appearance, showing the varying layers of meat and fat. If your slab comes with the skin (rind), it should be facing out.
2. Use some butcher's twine to wrap up the pork belly. Each wrap should be a S inch (1 cm) in between.
3. Cut off the green part of long green onion and slice the ginger.
4. Heat the neutral-flavored oil in a pot or Dutch oven over high heat. Add the rolled pork belly in the pot.
5. Sear the pork belly one side at a time, rotating to make sure all sides are nicely seared. This will take around 10-15 minutes.
6. Optionally remove the pork while you deglaze the pot/Dutch oven.
7. Put the green onion, ginger, sake, soy sauce, water, and sugar in the pot/Dutch oven. Deglaze the pot.
8. If you removed the pork belly, add it back into the pot. 
9. Bring the liquid to a boil. Once boiling, skim off the foam and scum. Then turn the heat to low/simmer.
10. Put an Otoshibuta (drop lid) on top to press the ingredients down. If you dont have an Otoshibuta, you can make one by poking some holes in a circular piece of aluminum foil. 
11. Simmer on low heat, and covered with Otoshibuta at all times for the next 2 hours, rotating chashu every 30 minutes.
12. After 2 hours, turn off the heat to let cool until it can be placed in a plastic bag without melting it.
13. Once the meat is slightly cooled, transfer to a container or Ziploc bag (or vacuum sealable bag if you're fancy). Strain the leftover cooking liquid over a fine-mesh strainer. 
14. Add ½ cup of the cooking liquid into the bag. Seal the bag or container. Reserve the rest of the braising liquid for ramen eggs (see below).
15. Rest the chashu in the refrigerator overnight.
16. The next day, open the bag and remove the chashu. Cut the twine with kitchen shears and remove them completely.
17. Slice the chashu into ¼ inch slices (if using for ramen) or chop into bite-size pieces (if using for pizza).

**Ramen Eggs:**

1. Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. There should be enough water to cover the eggs (should be 1 inch above eggs).
2. When boiling, take out the eggs from the refrigerator and carefully and slowly submerge the eggs into the boiling water with a mesh strainer/skimmer or ladle to prevent the eggs from cracking.
3. Immediately reduce heat to maintain a simmer (gentle boil) and cook the eggs for exactly 7 minutes (See Notes). Make sure the water is simmering, but not so hot that the eggs bounce around. If you want your egg yolk to be in the center, gently rotate the eggs with chopsticks once in a while for the first 3 minutes so the egg yolk will be in the center.
4. After 7 minutes, immediately take out the eggs and soak in the ice bath to stop them from cooking further. Let them cool for 3 minutes.
5. The soft boiled eggs are not completely hardened so gently peel the eggs.
6. Place the eggs in a Ziploc bag and pour in the leftover chashu braising liquid (see above). The eggs should be submerged in the marinade. Let them marinate overnight to up to 3-4 days in the refrigerator.
7. Take out the eggs and cut in halves to serve. Enjoy the eggs by themselves or use them as a ramen topping. 

**Pizza Dough:**

1. Combine 1 cup of flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. If desired, add garlic powder and dried basil at this point as well.
2. Add olive oil and warm water and use a wooden spoon to stir well very well.
3. Gradually add another 1 cup of flour. Add any additional flour as needed, stirring until the dough is forming into a cohesive, elastic ball and is beginning to pull away from the sides of the bowl. The dough will still be slightly sticky but still should be manageable with your hands.
4. Drizzle a separate, large, clean bowl generously with olive oil and use a pastry brush to brush up the sides of the bowl.
5. Lightly dust your hands with flour and form your pizza dough into a round ball and transfer to your olive oil-brushed bowl. Use your hands to roll the pizza dough along the inside of the bowl until it is coated in olive oil, then cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and place it in a warm place.
6. Allow dough to rise for 30 minutes or until doubled in size. 
7. Once the dough has risen, use your hands to gently deflate it and transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead briefly until smooth (about 3-5 times). 
8. Use either your hands or a rolling pin to work the dough into 12"" circle.
9. Transfer dough to a pizza pan dusted with cornmeal and either pinch the edges or fold them over to form a crust.
10. Drizzle additional olive oil (about a tablespoon) over the top of the pizza and use a pastry brush to brush the entire surface of the pizza (including the crust) with olive oil. 
11. Use a fork to poke holes all over the center of the pizza to keep the dough from bubbling up in the oven.

**Miso Ramen Broth:**

1. Mince the garlic, ginger, and shallot. 
2. Grind sesame seeds, leaving some seeds unground for texture.
3. In a medium pot, heat the sesame oil over medium low heat and add the minced garlic, ginger, and shallot.
4. With a wooden spatula, stir fry until fragrant.
5. Add the meat and increase heat to medium. Cook the meat until no longer pink.
6. Add spicy/non-spicy bean paste and miso. Quickly blend well with the meat before they get burnt.
7. And add the ground sesame seeds and sugar and mix well.
8. Add sake and chicken stock, and bring it to a simmer.
9. Taste your soup and add salt (if necessary) and white pepper. Each chicken stock varies in saltiness, so you have to taste your own soup to decide how much salt is necessary.
10. Cover with the lid and keep the ramen soup simmered while you cook noodles.

**Pizza:**

1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (215°C).
2. Cook your ramen according to the package directions, removing from the boiling water 30 seconds earlier than suggested.
3. Combine your miso ramen broth and your pizza sauce. 
4. Onto your pizza dough, spread your sauce mixture. Add your shredded mozzarella, then add as much ramen and chashu as you want.
5. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven. Add your sliced ramen eggs. 
7. Bake in the oven for 3 - 5 minutes, until your crust has browned. 
8. Slice and serve.

2021-01-17,6,"My 90yo Grandma's Braised Chicken with Mushrooms!","WokandKin","This is Grandma's Braised Chicken Wings and Mushrooms in Oyster Sauce recipe!

Here are the instructions with [visuals](https://www.wokandkin.com/braised-chicken-wings-and-mushrooms-in-oyster-sauce/).

**My Favorite Cantonese Side Dish**

Ive never known a dish Ive loved more than Grandmas Braised Chicken Wings and Mushrooms in Oyster Sauce. The magic of this recipe doesnt just start when you taste it on steaming hot rice.

It starts when you lift the lid off the wok as the wings are gently braising in mushroom juices and you get that first waft&its earthy aromas are just out of this world. And thats just the beginning!

The chicken is so silky it slides right off the bone then slowly melts in your mouth. The whole dish is cooked with oyster sauce, which gets infused in the mushrooms and transforms them into something spectacular. Think of a delicious thick, savoury glaze except its inside the mushroom!

One bite and youll fall in love.

Seriously, just look at how the golden wings and mushrooms *glow*.

**Which Chicken Cut Do I Use?**

The best part about this recipe is that you can use any cut of chicken youd like with oyster sauce and mushroom  breast, thigh, you name it.

The reason why we choose wings above all the other cuts is because it has everything a tasty piece of chicken offers: a great meat to fat ratio and a way to cook straight from the bone.

We all know that anything cooked with the bone in tact tastes \*so\* much better.

Now, if you prefer other chicken parts, this recipe will taste amazing with any of them!

**How Can I Subsitute Oyster Sauce?**

Ill be completely honest&you cant replicate the exquisite savouriness in a good oyster sauce. Luckily, theyre fairly easy to come by in Asian supermarkets.

But if you dont have oyster sauce handy in your pantry, dont panic! There are a few ways to get a flavour that resembles oyster sauce:

* **Vegetarian oyster sauce.** Made exclusively from mushrooms, vegetarian flavoured mushroom sauce is a great alternative especially for vegetarians or anyone allergic to shellfish.
* **Soy sauce.** While theyre not exactly the same, youll get the saltiness oyster sauce offers. Just use less than what youd normally add for oyster sauce and use some sugar to balance out the salt.
* **Hoisin sauce.** The consistency of hoisin sauce is as thick as oyster sauce but has a sharp sweetness that can be adjusted with a little salt.

**The Recipe**

* Prep Time: 25 minutes
* Cook Time: 30 minutes
* Total Time: 55 minutes
* Servings: 6

**Ingredients**

* 100 g / 0.22 lb dehydrated shiitake mushrooms (or any mushrooms you have available)
* 3 US cups water (saved from soaking mushrooms)
* 1.5 kg / 3.3 lb chicken wings
* 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 3 tbsp cooking oil
* 3/4 tsp salt, or to taste
* 1 tbsp sugar, or to taste
* 3/4 tbsp chicken bouillon powder
* 4 tbsp oyster sauce (3 tbsp for the marinade, 1 tbsp for braising)
* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce

**Instructions**

1. Soak the shiitake mushrooms in water for at least 20 minutes then drain. Keep the water aside for later.
2. Marinate the chicken wings in oyster sauce, salt, sugar and chicken bouillon powder for a minimum of 20 minutes.
3. Pour the oil into a wok and brown the garlic on a medium heat.
4. Turn the heat up to high and toss in the chicken wings to sear for 2 minutes.
5. When seared, add the mushrooms in and stir for 2 minutes.
6. Add the saved mushroom liquid into the wok along with the oyster sauce and dark soy sauce.
7. Bring the liquid to a boil then turn down the heat to medium/low to braise the wings and mushroom on a simmer for 20 minutes.
8. Serve over rice!",3655

**Pear Almond Cake Ingredients:**
  
* 1 cup (227 grams) unsalted butter, softened. 
* 1½ cups (300 grams) granulated sugar
* `3 large eggs
* `2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour
* `¼ teaspoon kosher salt
* S cup whole milk
* 1 teaspoon almond extract
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 large (or two small) pears cored and cut into ½ inch slices
* Sliced Almonds and Powdered Sugar (for garnish)
  
**Instructions:**
[Video Tutorial ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKFX-h4AQrr/?igshid=p12z2t85n5b6)
  
* Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 9-inch cast-iron skillet
* In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy (about 3 to 4 minutes).  
* Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla and almond extracts.
* In a small bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Alternate adding in the flour mixture and milk until everything is combined. Be careful not to overmix.
* Spoon batter into prepared pan and lightly press the pear slices in a pinwheel fashion over batter.
* Bake until lightly browned, about 45-55 minutes. Let cool in pan for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with almonds and dust with powdered sugar. 
  
Bon Appetit!  
  
**Pro Tips:**
  
1. If you own a cast iron skillet, use it for this recipe! I've made in a cake pan and it works perfectly fine, but if you want a nice crisp crust on the outside then cast iron is definitely the way to go! If you still plan to use a cake pan, just keep in mind that it might take slightly longer to cook since it will not get as hot as the cast iron.  
2. If the cake still looks slightly under cooked in the very center when the timer goes off, it might actually be done. This threw me off the first time I made the cake, because the moisture in the pears makes it look raw. Just take a toothpick and poke it slightly off of the center to check. Also keep in mind that the cake will continue to bake slightly when it comes out the oven. You definitely don't want a dry overcooked cake!
3. The pears you use definitely dont have to be ripe, actually it's better if they are still a little firm. They will soften in the oven and hold their shape better.",2619

### INGREDIENTS 

* 4-5 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 50 little neck clams (2 lbs)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced (1-2 Tbsp)
* 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1 c dry white wine (eg Sauvignon Blanc)
* 8 oz linguine
* 1/2 c reserved pasta water
* 1/4 c fresh Italian flat leaf parsley, finely chopped
* Kosher salt to taste

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Start bringing the pasta water to a boil. When you add salt, use a little less than usual. 
* While following the steps below, cook 8 oz pasta slightly less than al dente, as it will finish cooking in the sauce.
* In a saucepan large enough to fit the clams in no more than about two layers, heat 1 Tbsp of olive oil, add the clams, and cover with a lid. Shake and stir occasionally. It will take about 8-10 minutes (depending on the heat) until the clams open up.
* When the clams have all opened up, put a strainer in a bowl to catch all the cooking liquids when draining the clams. 
* Remove the meat from most of the cooked clams, but also leave some in the shell. The clams left in the shell make an excellent presentation when serving, and the clams removed from the shell will get the full pan sauce treatment on all sides.
* Using the same saucepan you just cooked the clams in, heat 4 Tbsp of extra-virgin olive oil, and add 1 Tbsp (or 2) minced garlic and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. Let the garlic (and pepper flakes) soften for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
* Put the clams (including the ones you left in the shell) back into the pan and give it a good stir. 
* Crank up the heat and add 1 c of dry white wine (Sauvignon Blanc works great) and let the wine reduce (steam) for about 5 minutes. Reduce heat.  
* Add 1/2 c pasta water and the cooked and drained pasta, and give it another good stir. Taste and add salt as needed.
* Drizzle with another 2 Tbsp of extra-virgin olive oil and 1/4 c finely chopped Italian parsley. Use tongs to serve. Enjoy!",2126

Ingredients:

7 lb Beef Chuck Short Rib (Dino Ribs)
ChupacabraRub Season-All and Brisket Magic

Spritz: water and apple cider vinegar 1:1 ratio

1 chimney of oak lump charcoal
5 post oak smoking logs

Preparation:

Trim the excess fat from the top of the Dino ribs.
Let come to room temperature and season the top and sides of the ribs. (We used ChupacabraRub, but you can substitute with your favorite bbq rubs or just salt and pepper 1:1 ratio)
Bring the smoker to a constant temperature of 275°F.

Place the ribs in the middle of the smoker.
After 1 hour spritz the ribs every 30 minutes.

The next part comes to personal preference:
1) wrap the ribs in butcher paper at an internal temperature of around 145-150°F for more juicier ribs
2) wrap the ribs in butcher paper at an internal temperature of around 160-165°F for that nice dark bark

We went with option #1 and wrapped at around 150°F.

Pull from the smoker when the ribs have reached an internal temperature of 205°F.
The total cook time will vary depending on size of the smoker and weather conditions.
For two racks of Dino ribs weighing in at 7 pounds total took 6 1/2 hours at a smoking temperature of 275°F.
Once pulled from the smoker let rest for at least 30 minutes.

2021-01-15,4,"Easy Ramen Eggs!","v1nchent","Not all that difficult to be honest. Ramen is a style of food, the actual ingredients don't really matter. 'authentic' is not that difficult

You need 5 things:

1. An UNSEASONED soup base: preferably clear but even that is not necessary. eg: chicken broth, pork broth, vegetable stock, beef broth. 

2. A tare: This is basically the seasoning of your soup. It's something that should taste overseasoned because you use only a tablespoon or 2 for each bowl. You can make a bunch and keep it in the fridge/freezer for storage and put a tablespoon or 2 in your bowl when you need it. You can get as creative as you want here, I suggest googling a few recipes and just do what you want here. Just make sure there is a form of salt here or your soup base will taste like hot water. You need some form of salt to 'unlock' the flavour of the soup.

3. Noodles: as long as you don't use the deep fried kind (the ones you find in instant ramen) you're good. You can use rice noodles, dough noodles or even vermicelli. Originally you want alkaline noodles, but those are just different in texture, the flavour is not that different. You can make these yourself but storebought is more than adequate.

4. Oil: this is where the smell comes from. Oil doesn't mix with water and rests on top of the ramen the whole meal so you can smell it during the whole meal. 
Smell is a really important part of any meal as it is a big part of what 'taste' is. You can go with a ton of different options here: spicy, oniony, gingery, blueberry if you want (don't suggest the latter).
The trick is to start with a neutral tasting oil that you can get in the grocery store and then infusing is with what you want to accentuate the dish with. This is not the focus of the dish but will be a part of it.

5. Toppings: go wild. You could make some really complex toppings or just add some soft boiled egg, some scallions and a piece of raw steak cut thinly. You don't have to find rare ingredients to make toppings. You could obviously go as wild as you want here, so go wild :)




I hope this helped on your journey to make ramen. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.",2148

Anyhoo, yours looks amazing and now I'm debating whether or not it's worth it to cook it at 1am in the morning (it is).

**Ingredients**

*For the Pavlova meringue*

* 4 egg whites
* 200 g caster sugar (you might not need it all)
* 2 tsp corn flour
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 tsps lemon juice

*For the toppings*

* A very ripe sweet mango
* Raspberries
* \[Optional\] icing sugar

**Steps**

*Making the Pavlova*

\[1\] In a stand mixer whisk the egg whites until they form ""soft peaks"". At this point start adding the sugar while mixing until it forms ""stiff peaks"" and it's glossy. **Note**: some people don't like their meringue too sweet so taste as you go and only add as much sugar as you like

\[2\] Once the egg white + sugar mix has formed stiff peaks, add the vanilla extract, lemon juice, and corn flour and mix until combined. 

\[3\] Preheat the oven to 150C. Cover a baking tray with parchment paper. Scoop the meringue out of the mixing bowl and onto the tray. It's time to get creative!! Form a dome of meringue and use a thin spatula of a flat knife to decorate the cake with some ridges. 

\[4\] Bake at 150C for only 10 minutes. Then, turn the temperature down to 100C and keep cooking for around 1h 15 to 1h 30. Once that time is passed, switch off the oven and let the Pavlova slowly cool inside the oven, otherwise it will crack :(

*Decorating the cake*

Prep Time: 1hr 30 minutes

Cook Time: 15 minutes

Total Time: 1 hr 45 minutes

Servings: 4

#### EQUIPMENT

- Mortar &amp; Pestle (preferred) OR Food Processor  

#### INGREDIENTS

- 1.5 cups coconut cream cc  

- 3 tbs green curry paste, see my previous reels for recipe cc  

- 2 tbs fish sauce cc  

- 2 chicken drums and 2 thighs  

- 2 cups chicken stock cc  

- 3 kaffir lime leaves torn cc  

- 1 long red chillies chopped cc  

- 3 apple eggplants quarteredcc
- A few Thai sweet basil leaves for garnish 
- A few slices of chopped long red chilli for garnish

_Curry Paste_

- 3 tbs chopped green birds eye chillies c  

- 2 tbs chopped lemongrass c  

- 1 tbs chopped galangal c  

- 1 tbs grated or chopped lime zestc  

- 1 tbs chopped coriander root OR 2 tbs chopped stem c  

- 3 tbs chopped red shallot (or any other shallot)c  

- 2 tbs chopped garlic c  

- 10 white peppercorns c  

- 0.5 tsp coriander seeds, roasted then ground c  

- 0.25 cumin seeds, roasted then ground  

- 1 tsp shrimp paste

#### INSTRUCTIONS

#### MAKE THE CURRY PASTE

- For the dried spices, dry them in a pan before adding them to a spice grinder to a powder (video at bottom of page). If you don't have a spice grinder do it in the mortar and pestle then set them aside in a seperate bowl. If you neither spice grinder or mortar and pestle, use preground spices
- If using a mortar and pestle pound each ingredient into a fine paste before moving onto the next one. Do it in the order I have listed above (i.e. chillies first, lemongrass second etc). The shrimp paste can be just folded in with a spoon. Last thing to go in is the spice mix.

#### MAKING THE GREEN CURRY

- Boil coconut cream in a saucepan until it splits into oil and curds. This might take 10 minutes. Also, try to buy coconut cream that has no emulsifiers in it (so just coconut + water in the ingredients list) as emuslifiers make it harder to split.
- Fry paste for 5 minutes in the split coconut cream, stirring frequently to avoid burning.
- Season with fish sauce
- Add chicken and chicken stock
- Simmer for 20 mins or until chicken is cooked through.
- Add remaining ingredients and simmer for a minute or two before serving
- Garnish with Thai basil and chopped red chilli

#### TO SERVE

- Serve with jasmine rice  

- Asian style pickles are also a good accompaniment

Dough:

\- 250g all-purpose flour

\- 3g salt

\- 150ml warm water (120-140°F)

&amp;#x200B;

Filling:

\- 6 green onions

\- 1 tbsp all-purpose flour

\- 1g salt

\- 15g sesame seeds

\- 3 tbsps hot oil

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/swp6FTg1s8M)

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Mix the flour, salt and water together. Knead the dough for 2 min. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30-40 min.
2. Scallion filling: Chop six green onions, and grind sesame seeds using a marble mortar and pestle. In a bowl, add all the green onions, sesame seeds, 1 tbsp of flour, and a pinch of salt. Mix everything together. Heat up 3 tbsps of oil until it smokes, pour it into the bowl. Mix well.
3. Divide the dough into 5 pieces. Take one piece, roll out the dough into a big thin square. Spread the filling evenly onto the dough. Roll it up from one side and seal the seam. Roll it one more time and tuck the end at the bottom.
4. Using a rolling pin, start from the center, roll out the scallion pancake dough as thin as possible so that the pancake will be very crispy.
5. Pan frying: Put a pan over medium heat and wait for it to become hot. Add a generous amount of oil, then place the pancake in. After about 1-2 min, flip it to fry the other side. After about 1-2 min, flip it again. Crack one egg on top of the pancake, try to break it so that it covers most of the pancake. Flip the pancake after 1-2 min. Make sure the pancake doesn't get burned. The pancake is done when it is golden brown. Brush on your favorite sauces. Roll up the pancake and keep the egg inside.

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. Grinding the sesame seeds helps to maximize the fragrance. The hot oil will cook the green onions and sesame seeds. This helps to release fragrance and form a paste with the added flour. With this filling, the pancakes will always come out extra flaky and crispy.
2. The thinner the dough is, the crispier the pancake will be.
3. Transfer the pancakes onto some paper towels to soak up the excess oil.
4. How to store them properly: Place the dough on parchment paper, and stack it on top of each other, make sure they don't stick, and put them into a Ziploc bag. Freeze them, there is no need to defrost before each use.",2299

Method to the Madness

1. Grate the dry coconut. I like to NOT buy grated coconut as in my experience it never yields the same flavour.

2. Chop the dry fruits - raisins will be chopped into 2 or 3 pieces, almonds into 4,cashews into 4 and pistachios depending on size 2 or 4.

3. Dry roast your ginger powder for 30 seconds and set aside.

4. On a non stick pan (I make it in a Kadai) put in 2tbsp of ghee and roast the grated coconut on low heat. Within 2-3 mins of gentle stirring, you will notice it has slightly browned. Take it off the pan and set aside. 

5. Again in the same pan put in 2 tbsp of ghee and this time roast the dry fruits along with the white sesame seeds for 2-3 mins on low heat. Take them off the pan. 

6. On in the pan add 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water (ratio is 1:1) and let it cook for 5-7 mins, after which added the roasted coconut, the dry fruits, the ginger and cardamom powders. Stir and mix for 3-4 mins. The aim is to mix everything really well and also dry the water out but again on medium to low flame. After this add 1 tbsp of ghee and stir in in and take the pan off the heat.

---&gt; We need to cool it down to hand roll the mixture into Laddoos. 

7. PLEASE ensure your hands are washed and you have taken all finger rings or any other jewelry off. Grease you palm with ghee. 

8. Once the mix is Luke warm to touch take 2 spoons worth of it in your greased cupped palm and press it from the top with 2 fingers (index and middle) also slight cupped. You are making a compact round snow ball but of a small size. We want it to hold it shape but plus don't press too hard also. My cousin just uses an ice-cream scooper so whatever works for you =

***If youd like to learn a little more about the tradition and a little french in process check out my fiancé and I in this:***

**Ingredients:**  
* 6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature   
* ½ cup (60 grams) powdered sugar  
* ¾ cup (85 grams) almond flour  
* ¼ teaspoon salt  
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature  
* Zest of 1 meyer lemon  
* 1 tsp pure almond extract  
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract  
* 1 tablespoon rum (optional)  
* 2 frozen puff pastry sheets (14- to 17-ounce package; 396-482 grams), cut into two 9 in circles, cold 
* 1 feve (if you dont have a small charm, you can use a whole almond or dried bean instead)  
  
    
**Directions:**  
To make the filling
  
Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the almond flour and the salt. Mix in 1 whole egg, then the white from the second egg (reserve the yolk). Mix in the rum, if using, and the vanilla and almond extracts. Spoon into a piping bag or just cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. 
Mix the yolk with 1 teaspoon cold water; cover, and refrigerate until needed.   
  
   
**To assemble:**
  
Place one circle of dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Pipe or spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border bare. Press the charm into the filling. Moisten the border with cold water, position the second circle of dough over the filling and press around the border with your fingertips or the rim of a bowl to seal well. Using the back of a table knife, scallop the edges by pushing into the dough (about 1/4- to 1/2-inch deep) every 1/2 inch or so. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.  

Heat the oven to 425 F. Brush a thin layer of the reserved yolk glaze over the top of the galette, avoiding the border. With the point of a knife, etch a design into the top of the galette, taking care not to pierce the dough. Cut 6 small slits in the top as steam vents.  
  
Turn the heat down to 400 F, and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the galette is puffed and deeply golden. Check after 20 minutes, and tent loosely with foil if its browning too much or too fast. Transfer to a rack, and cool for at least 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.",2478

**Ingredients:**

***Servings: 5 (at 2 tacos/serving)***

*Teriyaki Sauce:*

""	1/3 cup mirin

""	1 cup soy sauce

""	Chili flakes to taste (I used Korean red chili, its spicy but it also has a nice sweetness to it)

""	7 cloves of garlic (minced)

""	3-4 tbsp minced ginger

""	1 tbsp sesame oil

""	½ cup rice vinegar

""	½ cup granulated sugar (I substituted with Lakanto Monk Fruit Sweetener, feel free to use any other high temperature stable sugar substitutes if you would like)

""	2 tsp black pepper (or to taste)

&amp;#x200B;

*Pico de Gallo:*

""	4 cups diced ripe Roma tomatoes

""	½ large or 1 small red onion diced or minced

""	7 cloves of garlic (minced)

""	½ cup chopped cilantro

""	½ fresh lime (juiced)

""	Salt and black pepper to taste

""	Diced jalapeno or serrano peppers (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

*Sriracha Mayo:*

""	½ cup mayo (I like to use Japanese mayo, Kewpie)

""	1 tbsp sriracha (or to taste)

&amp;#x200B;

*Tacos:*

""	1 lb flap meat (or you choice of protein)

""	¾ cup teriyaki sauce

""	½ head of cabbage, finely shredded

""	10 6 in tortillas

""	2 cups Pico de Gallo

""	1 cup spicy mayo

""	Fresh limes for juicing

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

*Teriyaki Sauce:*

1. Heat the mirin in a saucepan on high heat until it boils, then reduce heat to simmer for 10 mins.
2. Add the rest of the ingredients (soy sauce, chili flakes, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, rice vinegar, sugar, black pepper) to saucepan and simmer for 20 mins
3. Now is the time to taste the sauce and adjust it to your liking. Feel free to add more chili flakes, rice vinegar, sugar, and/or black pepper little by little until it best suits your taste buds. Chili flakes and black pepper for spice. Rice vinegar for sourness. Sugar for sweetness. Remember, youre the boss of your sauce  Chef John.

&amp;#x200B;

*Pico de Gallo:*

1. You can play around with the size you cut your tomatoes into depending on what you like. I like to cut them into squares no bigger than ¼.
2. You can also do the same with your onions. I would advise not to cut them into squares any larger than ¼ and keep them smaller than the tomato pieces.
3. You want to aim for a bite or scoop (if youre eating this with chips) that is balanced and has all the ingredients, so you dont want to have chunks that are too big.
4. Add your tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, peppers, and lime juice to a bowl and mix thoroughly.
5. Add salt and black pepper to taste. If youre going to be eating the Pico de Gallo with chips, make sure to taste test with the chips because the chips are salted as well.
6. Feel free to play around with this recipe and add other vegetables if you would like. Sometimes I like to add finely, diced cucumbers for some added freshness. Sometimes I like to add roasted corn for some more sweetness and crunch.

&amp;#x200B;

*Sriracha Mayo:*

1. Add the mayo and sriracha to a bowl and mix thoroughly.
2. Taste and adjust sauce to your liking. Add more mayo if you want to tone down the spice and make the sauce richer. Or add more sriracha if you want more spice.
3. (Optional) Add sauce to a squeeze bottle for ease of use.

&amp;#x200B;

*Tacos:*

1. Feel free to adjust the taco portion of this recipe for the amount of servings you want. You can always save leftover sauce in your fridge for other recipes. You can also eat any leftover Pico de Gallo with chips, quesadillas, etc. the possibilities are endless. This stuff is pretty much good on anything!
2. Marinate your meat in the teriyaki sauce for at least an hour, ideally overnight.
3. Grill or pan sear your meat on a medium-high heat to the doneness that you like (if youre cooking beef). If youre using chicken or pork, make sure to cook it all the way. Be sure to flip your meat and baste with the sauce frequently. Use a meat thermometer to check the doneness of your meat.

Note: I like to use a grill because I find that the sauce burns easily in a pan.

4.	Allow your meat to rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.

5.	Cut your meat in thin strips, against the grain. If youre using flap meat or skirt steak, cut your meat into more manageable chunks (about 3-4 ins wide) with the grain before cutting into thin strips.

6.	Warm up or toast your tortillas in a pan or on a grill.

7.	Assemble your tacos. I like to assemble my tacos in the following order (from bottom-to-top): tortilla, shredded cabbage, sliced meat, Pico de Gallo, sriracha mayo, and lime juice. I like to assemble my tacos in the following manner:

a.	Place your tortilla down on a plate.

b.	Place a little less than ¼ cup of shredded cabbage on the tortilla.

c.	Place 3-4 strips of your meat on the cabbage.

d.	Add 1.5 tbsp Pico de Gallo on the meat.

e.	Drizzle sriracha mayo on top (to taste).

f.	Squeeze lime on top (to taste).

There are no rules to this. This is what I like, but you can assemble your tacos and adjust the ratios however you like. Remember, youre the El Chapo of your taco  Chef John (I think).",5035
2021-01-12,1,"Eggplant &amp; Red Onion Tart, with Vegan Cheese","AndrewClemmens"," INGREDIENTS 

* 325 g ready-rolled puff pastry\*
* 1 medium aubergine (eggplant)
* 1 red onion
* 4 tbsp sun-dried tomato paste
* 50 g or a sprinkling of grated Cheddar Cheese, I used Daiya Chedder shreds because I prefer vegan cheese

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Start by preheating your oven to 400 degrees and take your puff pastry out from the freezer. It will need to rest for at least 20 minutes to unthaw and soften enough so that you can unfold it without breaking it.
* Then prepare a dish or shallow bowl  you will add half the olive oil and use your hands or a pastry brush to coat your eggplants on each side. Then set it off to the side. Ideally, Chetna recommends only 2 tablespoons of olive oil for this but I ended up using much more than this as the eggplants continued to soak up the oil quickly.
* Heres where I recommend deviating from the instructions. Chetna recommends using high heat to cook them 4-5 minutes on each side but perhaps her grill is less hot than mine. Putting this on high heat made my eggplants turn completely black. Instead, I grilled them for 2 minutes on each side on medium-high heat. The eggplants will still taste good charred and blackened, but you dont want them to shrivel too much. Set them aside to cool.
* Then, lower your heat to medium. Add the rest of your olive oil (or an additional two tablespoons) and add in the red onions. Cover the griddle pan with a lid and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring from time to time so they dont stick. Let them cool.
* Now, unfold your puff pastry onto a sheet of parchment paper in a pan. If you dont want to use parchment paper, just flour your baking tray as the puff pastry will stick. Score a line half an inch from the edge for a guide.
* Spread the tomato paste inside the rectangle. Add your cooked onions and spread them as evenly as you can, then sprinkle 1/2 a teaspoon of salt over it.
* Now, take your eggplant slices and sprinkle with the rest of the salt. Now, add on your cheese! I used Daiya cheddar cheese the first time, and then a combination of cheddar &amp; mozzarella shreds which I loved.
* Bake for 25-30 minutes, and let cool.

&amp;#x200B;

**INGREDIENTS:**

 

For the dacquoise:

* 250 gr hazelnuts
* 1 tablespoon baking soda
* 70 gr powdered sugar
* 150 gr egg whites
* 130 gr granulated sugar
* 20 gr corn flour
* pinch of salt

For the chocolate cream:

* 500 ml full fat milk
* 10 gr cocoa powder
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 6 egg yolks
* 85 gr granulated sugar
* 30 gr corn starch
* 150 gr dark chocolate
* 60 gr butter, room temp

For the garnish:

* 50 gr hazelnuts, toasted, skinned
* 50 gr powdered sugar

&amp;#x200B;

**METHOD:**

 

**For the dacquoise:**

1)To start off, blanch the hazelnuts in a pot of boiling water with a tablespoon of baking soda. Keep the hazelnut submereged for 3 minutes, then immediately transfer to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process. Easily peel off the skin by hand.

2)Now to toast your skinned hazelnuts, either place them in a pan over medium heat and toss constantly for 10 minutes or transfer to a baking tray and bake in the center of your oven for 10 minutes on 180\*C.

3)Once toasted, let the hazelnuts cool down, then blend semi-fine in a food processor. (you dont want to go all the way to flour fine, some little bits and chunks are appreciated.)

4)Now in your mixing bowl, add the ground hazelnuts, powdered sugar and corn flour, mix to incorporate.

5)In a second bowl, beat the egg whites and salt with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks start to appear. Once you reach the desired texture, turn the speed to high and start adding granulated sugar gradually and keep beating until stiff and glossy sharp peaks have formed.

6)Now place your dry ingredients over your french meringue and start gently folding with a rubber spatula, going from the bottom and working up to the top incorporating more air.

7)Once all the ingredients are just incorporated beautifully, transfer your mixture to a piping bag fitted with a wide nozzle.

8)Place a piece of parchment paper on your baking tray and draw out a 20cm diameter circle. Starting from the center, gently pipe out the dacquoise circularly, making sure not to overlap the drawn edges. Repeat this step 3 times for 3 seperate dacquoise layers. (I smeared some of the batter under the parchment paper to help it stick, it looks awful, but does the trick.)  


9)Bake the dacquoise in a preheated oven to 150\*C for 1 hour. If using an oven with Fan feature, place all of the dacquoise layers in the oven simultaneously and switch their positions every 15 minutes just to make double sure theyre baked evenly.

10)Remove the dacquoise from the parchment paper within first few minutes of baking, as they will stick completely once cooled.

**For the chocolate cream:**

1)Add the milk and the vanilla to a heavy bottom pot and bring to a boil on medium-low heat.

2)While the milk is heating, in a mixing bowl, beat together yolks, sugar, cocoa powder and cornstarch until light and creamy. (approx. 2 minutes with an electric mixer.)

3)When the milk reaches a boil, take it off the heat and temper in your egg mixture. That means you need to pour some (about a third) hot milk very gently into the yolks mixture while constantly whisking to raise their temperature steadily. If you were to add your yolks into the hot milk you would get a scrambled egg. (the tempering photo is from a different recipe.)

4)Now transfer your tempered mixture into the pot with the remaining milk and place over medium-low heat whisking constantly until it starts thickening to a pudding like consistency. Your cream must be taken off the heat once the air bubbles start to rapidly pop up on the surface, or reaching 80\*C if using a food thermometer.

5)Now toss in your chopped chocolate and whisk untill all of the chocolate has blended in to the cream.

6)Once blended, add in your room temp butter and mix with a rubber spatula, rather than a whisk so as not to break the milk solids apart until blended. (I switched to a spatula after having taken the photo.)

7)Place the chocolate cream in a bowl, and cover the surface with cling film, then refrigirate until completely cooled.

**For the garnish**:

1)Place your toasted and skinned hazelnuts into a nonstick pan along with powdered sugar.

2)Keeping the pan constantly on medium heat, stir the hazelnuts and sugar with a spatula until caramelized. this will take 5-10 minutes. Be careful to take the pan off the heat once reaching an amber color, going any further will make the hazelnuts bitter.

3)Transfer to a piece of parchment paper and chop once cooled.

**To assemble your dacquoise cake:**

1)To assemble your dacquoise, place a tablespoon of your cream onto your serving plate and set one dacquoise layer over to make it stick. Pipe out your chocolate cream over the dacquoise layer. Place another dacquoise layer over the cream and repeat. Top with the last layer and garnish with powdered sugar and chopped caramelized hazelnuts.

2)If you prefer a more rustic look, keep the sides uncovered, I had excess chocolate cream and used it to spread out over the sides and garnished with extra chopped hazelnuts.",5253

For the full recipe with step by step pictures: [http://meza-blog.com/recipe/beetroot-risotto/](http://meza-blog.com/recipe/beetroot-risotto/)

**INGREDIENTS**

**Risotto:**

 

* 2 medium beetroots
* 170 gr rice, arborio or carnarroli
* 140 ml water
* 1 onion
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 dl white wine
* 0.5 liter vegetable stock, (more if needed)
* 1 tablespoon butter, preferably room temp
* 20 gr grated parmesan cheese

**garnish:**

* 50 gr fresh goat cheese
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* pinch of salt
* 1/2 teaspoon orange zest

**METHOD:**

 

1)Start by making the puree for your risotto. Simply place your beetroots in a baking tray, cover with aluminum foil and place inside a pre heated oven on 180\*C.

2)Bake the beetroots until fork tender (piercing a fork inside without applying any pressure). Time may vary from 45 minutes to 2 hours.

3)Once fork tender, peel the skin off, dice the beets roughly and blend with a stix mixer.  
your beatiful beetroot puree is now ready to use!

For the garnish:

1)Place your cheese, olive oil and salt into a shallow mixing bowl and blend well with a stix mixer.

2)Pass the creamy mixture through a fine sieve to assure a more stable texture.

3)Mix well with the orange zest and set aside for further use.

For the risotto:

1)Start by preparing the rice. Take a skillet or shallow pot and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your rice.

2)Stir constantly for about 2-3 minutes until the edges of the grain start becoming translucent.

3)Now that we build a protective layer around the grain, pour in your water and stir frequently until all the water has evaporated.

4)Transfer the rice onto a tin, and let cool.

5)Once cool, your rice is ready to use. This is a neat little step worth making when cooking risotto as it helps release more of that starchy goodness later on when cooking the risotto. Par-cooked rice like this can last up to a week in a food container in your fridge and will greatly shorten your time preparing risotto.

6)Now take your skillet and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle over a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your diced onions.

7)Saute the onions until soft and translucent. It will probably take in between 7-10 minutes.

8)Once your onions are beautifully tender, add in your finely minced garlic and stir for another minute.

9)Now add in your rice and season with salt and pepper. (This is the perfect time to add salt as it will drain any extra juices which will be absorbed by the rice.)

10)Stir constantly for another minute or two and proceed to pour in your wine.

11)Keep stirring (from this moment on, youll have to be stirring most of the time as more motion the rice makes, the more starch it releases, creating a creamy texture.) until all the wine has evaporated.

12)Now that your wine has evaporated, add 3 tablespoons of your beetroot pure and stir until incorporated.  


13)Now start adding your vegetable stock (hot! so it doesnt prevent the rice from continuing to cook.) a little at a time as the rice absorbs the liquid. The reason you dont pour it all at the same time is because you dont know how much liquid the rice will absorb.  


14)When the rice is cooked al-dente  it should still have a slightly runny to watery texture, we dont want it thick.

15)Now turn off the heat and add the butter, preferably room temperature so it blends more quickly

16)Once you add the butter, now is the time to really work your hand, and give the rice a good beating, stirring it vigorously until all the butter has blended with the dish.  


17)After the butter has blended add the parmesan cheese and beat again, this time not as vigorously until the cheese has melted.",3762

Too raw is a no-no. Too cooked through, it is dry. 

At the time I only eat it when I am in Japan, as Yakitori. Without Covid, I used to go once or twice a year (business + family), but now ...

I could do it myself, but here in Germany the quality is mediocre, or you have to go to a good specialized butcher. The next one is 30 minutes with the car, and I am just too lazy. A lot easier 12 hours with the plane :)",479

2021-01-10,5,"15 Minute Pizza Dough + Prosciutto Cheesy Goodness. Also a very extra pizza for someone who couldnt get enough toppings.","waveportico","(15 minute) Pizza Dough &amp; Toppings 

ONE full (12 inch) pizza dough (15 minutes)

-1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
 
-1 teaspoon white sugar
 
-1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
 
-2	½ cups bread flour
 
-2 tablespoons olive oil
 
1 teaspoon salt

Step 1
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
 In a medium bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water.
 Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.


Step 2
Stir in flour, salt and oil. Beat until smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes.

 Step 3
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a round. 
Transfer crust to a lightly greased pizza pan or baker's peel dusted with cornmeal. (I used flour instead of cornmeal)*
Spread with desired toppings (2 toppings recipes below) and bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving.**

*instead of using the pizza pan I prefer to use a cast iron skillet or a pizza stone. Leave the cast iron/pizza stone in the oven while its heating up, still cover it with flower. 

**if worried about moisture content of ingredients affecting the crust you can also bake crust for 5-10 minutes and then put toppings on and bake for another 10-15 minutes. 




Topping Option 1 - Prosciutto Goodness 

-1 tbsp olive oil 

-1tsp minced garlic 

Spread across pizza after you have laid dough in pan 

-1 cup mozzarella cheese mix (6 cheese with Asiago works), use up to a cup and a half, to taste

-1tsp diced pimentos

-¼ cup diced orange bell pepper

-¼ cup mushrooms 

-6 strips of prosciutto divided evenly across pizza 

-¼ cup pepperoni or ham circles 

-¼-½ cup Parmesan cheese to top 


Topping Option 2 - Petty Pizza 


Well, I guess Ill give a small amount of background for this pizza. Someone didnt think the prosciutto and cheese etc. Would be enough and asked me to go to the store at 7pm on the weekend to get more meat and toppings. Okay.. you want more toppings? Not a problem.


-1 Tbsp olive Oil 

-1 tsp garlic 

Same beginning for this one 

-1 cup Mozzarella cheese mix (+ half cup of another cheese mix if you have it, for spite.)

-S cup chopped cherry tomatoes 

-S cup diced orange bell pepper 

-S cup mushrooms 

-¼ cup diced red onions 

-¼ cup black olives

-(optional) sprinkle some jarred jalapeños 


-3 grilled sausages, cut into quarter inch think circles 

-½ cup of already cooked Italian ground sausage 

-¼ cup pepperoni circle cuts

-¼ cup ham circle cuts

-¼ cup extra cheese mix + ¼ cup parmesan cheese mix 

-¼ cup fresh bacon bits 

Yeah.. definitely over the top. 

Also delicious. 

Hope you enjoy =

Oxtails are stick-to-your-stomach rich and indulgent, and to me, there's no better way to eat them than in a luxurious, melt-in-your-mouth stew! I grew up eating my grandma's Chinese version, and it's truly one of the easiest yet richest meals you could enjoy: it's fragrant from spices like star anise, cloves, and ginger, and has meat that's fall-off-the-bone tender, and what may be the best thing about this version is that it's quick and easy to make in an Instant Pot! While this stew could take 3-5 hours with constant nursing on the stove, the Instant Pot allows you to pressure cook this comforting Chinese stew in just 45 min!

**Chinese Oxtail Stew recipe**  
*Ingredients:* 

* 1 Tbsp neutral oil 
* 3.5-4 lb oxtails, trimmed and de-fatted
* 6 whole cloves 
* 4 whole star anise
* 3 bay leaves
* 1 inch piece ginger, sliced and smashed 
* 7-8 garlic cloves, smashed 
* 2 tsp sugar (or rock sugar) 
* 2 Tbsp dark soy sauce 
* 3 Tbsp light soy sauce 
* 1/2 C shaoxing wine (or dry sherry) 
* 1.5 C water 

*Directions:* 

1. Turn Instant Pot on ""saute"" mode and add 1 Tbsp oil to the pot. Allow to heat up. Then, add oxtails in groups so that you brown \*all\* sides of the oxtails. More browning = more flavor! 
2. Once all oxtails are browned on all sides, turn ""saute"" mode off and pour out any excess oil from the pot. Turn ""saute"" mode on again, and add the cloves, star anise, bay leaves, ginger, and garlic cloves. Saute until the spices are fragrant and the garlic/ginger have browned a bit. 
3. Add in remaining ingredients (sugar, soy sauces, wine, and water) to the pot. Stir to combine. Then, add in all the browned oxtails. Turn saute mode off. 
4. Put lid on Instant Pot, switch to High Pressure mode,  and set timer for 45 min to pressure cook. Make sure the knob is set to ""sealing."" 
5. Once 45 min is up, allow pot to naturally release, then open the pot. Switch the mode to ""saute"" and allow the oxtail sauce to reduce until it can coat the back of a spoon. 
6. Season to taste with salt/pepper. Garnish with chopped scallions and cilantro, serve with steaming hot rice, and enjoy.",2290

* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* ½ tbsp shaoxing wine

* ½ tsp white pepper
* 3 cloves garlic minced
* 3 stalks scallions finely chopped
* ½ inch ginger minced
* 1 pack dumpling wrappers

### Instructions

#### Filling

* 10 minutes before making your pork mixture, wash and chop your napa cabbage into fine pieces. Squeeze out all the water and add salt to draw out extra liquids.

#### Pan-Fry

* Heat 2 tbsp of vegetable oil in a skillet. Place dumplings in bottom down and let it cook for 2 minutes until bottoms are slightly browned.

* **Servings:** 8 buns
* **Time:** 1½ hours active, 12 hours total

*Ingredients*

Brioche dough:

* 160g (1S cup) all-purpose flour
* 170g (1S cup + 1 tablespoon) bread flour
* 1½ teaspoon active dry yeast
* 25g (2 tablespoons) granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon sea salt
* 60ml (¼ cup) cold water
* 2 eggs
* 1 egg yolk
* 155g (1S stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature, cubed

Sauce:

* 85g (¾ stick) unsalted butter
* 160g (¾ cups) light brown sugar
* 55g (2½ tablespoons) honey
* 40g (2¾ tablespoons) heavy cream
* 40g (2¾ tablespoons) water
* ¼ teaspoon sea salt
* 75g (½ cup + 1 tablespoon) pecans, toasted and chopped

Filling:

* 50g (¼ cup) light brown sugar
* 50g (¼ cup) granulated sugar
* 1½ teaspoon cinnamon

*Directions*

Brioche dough:

1. In a large bowl, combine all-purpose flour, bread flour, yeast, sugar, salt, water, eggs and egg yolk. Mix with a spatula until all of the ingredients come together. Knead by hand for 5 minutes  the dough will be stiff and quite dry.
2. Add one piece of softened butter at a time, kneading until it disappears into the dough. It will be squelchy once the butter is added, but keep kneading and it will come together.
3. Once all the butter has been incorporated, knead for another 20 minutes until the dough is smooth and silky. If the dough is too loose and is more like a batter than dough, add 2  3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour. It is ready when you can gather all the dough and pick it up in one piece.
4. Place the dough in a large bowl and cover with cling film, pressing the wrap directly onto the surface of the dough. Let the dough proof in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or up to overnight. At this point, you can freeze the dough in an airtight container for up to 1 week. (Note: dough wont puff up too much in the fridge since its cold.)

Sauce:

1. In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in brown sugar until the sugar dissolves and forms a smooth sauce.
2. Remove from heat and whisk in honey, cream, water and salt. Let cool for about 30 minutes, or until cooled to room temperature.

Assembly:

1. On a floured work surface, roll out refrigerated dough into a rectangle 15-inch (38cm) wide by 12-inch (30cm) long and about ¼ inch (0.6cm) thick. Position the rectangle so the short side is facing you.
2. In a small bowl, stir the brown sugar, granulated sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkled this evenly over the surface of the dough. Starting from the short side farthest from you and working your way down, roll the rectangle up like a jelly roll, trying to roll tightly. Trim off about ¼ inch from the ends to ensure even rolls.
3. Cut the roll into 8 equal pieces with a bench scraper or knife.
4. Pour the sauce into a 9-by-13 inch (23cm x 33cm) baking dish, covering the bottom evenly. Sprinkle toasted pecans evenly over the sauce. Place the buns cut side down and evenly spaced in the baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot to proof for about 2 hours or until the dough is puffy, pillowy and soft.
5. Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool in the pan for 20 minutes (careful  the sauce is really hot at this point). One at time, invert the buns onto a serving platter and spoon any extra sauce from the bottom of the dish over the top.

### INGREDIENTS 

#### Risotto

* 1 c Arborio rice
* 2 Tbsp butter, divided
* 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/2 c dry white wine
* 4 c beef stock, warmed up (I use Knorr bouillon cubes)
* 1/2 c freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano
* 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* Kosher salt, as needed

#### Mushrooms

* 8 oz baby portobello (aka baby bellas, cremini, etc), thinly sliced to 1/4""
* 1 Tbsp butter
* 1 to 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/4 c shallots or yellow onion, chopped
* 1 Tbsp minced garlic
* 1 Tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp thyme and/or sage
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 1/2 c roughly chopped flat leaf Italian parsley

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Basic Risotto

* Heat 1 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil in a saucepan until you hear a light sizzle and the butter begins to bubble.
* Add 1 c of Arborio rice and stir evenly and thoroughly.
* After a minute or so  when the rice gets glossy (not brown), add 1/2 c of dry white wine and keep stirring. 
* Once the wine starts to bubble, it will be absorbed quickly (within about 2 minutes), so make sure you have 4 c of beef stock warmed and ready. Add one ladle of stock at a time and stir. Adjust the heat so its barely boiling. Just a couple bubbles here and there.
* Once the liquid is absorbed, add another ladle of stock, stir, and repeat. Watch, smell, and taste. From adding the first ladle to the last, it takes about 25 minutes from start to finish. Taste, but be careful with adding salt too soon. The stock will add additional salt, and so will the salty Parmigiano Reggiano. 
* When the rice is done, add (at least) 1 Tbsp butter and (at least) 1/2 c of Parmigiano Reggiano (the good stuff). Stir for about 2 minutes and add a couple cranks of black pepper (1/4 tsp).

#### Mushroom Risotto

Lots of key dough kneading techniques and other tips inside :D

Recipe:

* Cake flour or low-gluten flour (1000 grams)
* All-purpose flour (as needed)
* Water (500 grams)
* Sesame Paste (1/3 cup)
* Five Spice (1/3 tsp)
* Salt (1.5 tsp)
* Sugar (1/2 tsp)
* Baking Soda (1/2 tsp)
* Oil (3/4 cup +)
* Sesame Seeds (as needed)
* Soy sauce(as needed)
* You Tiao or Fried Dough Stick as an optional filling.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Prepare sesame filling by sifting 200 grams of cake flour into a bowl and mixing in sesame paste, five spice and 1/2 tsp of salt. Mix the ingredients together until well combined. Heat up 3/4 cup of oil until lightly smoking and pour into the sesame mixture. Be sure to pour in increments and stir. Mix until it becomes a smooth paste and set aside to let cool.
2. Sift 800 grams of cake flour into another bowl and mix with pinches of salt, sugar, baking soda. Add in 500 grams of hot water in increments while mixing. Once you get one solid piece of dough, drizzle on some oil and begin kneading the dough for 5 minutes. Cover and rest for 20 min.
3. Knead the dough once more for another 3-5 minutes, this dough should feel quite moist, sticky but not actually sticking to your fingers. Cover and rest for another 20 minutes.
4. Dust your workspace with some all-purpose flour and put the dough on top. Roll dough into a large flat rectangle sheet (about 1/2 cm or less). Spread a layer of the sesame paste on top of the sheet making sure that you mix it again prior to this. Then spread a layer of all-purpose flour on top of it.
5. Tightly roll the sheet from top to boom into a spiral, ensuring everything is tucked and secure. Tear or cut off large pieces of dough. Prepare a bowl of sesame seeds and soy sauce+water. Roll and fold the pieces into layers. (see video for demonstration) Dip in soy sauce then sesame seeds
6. Rest the folded pieces for 15 minutes then roll each one out into a rectangle shape. Bake on a hot tray (let tray heat up in oven then carefully take it out) for 10 minutes on 475° and then flip over to bake for anther 4-6 minutes. Done!

2021-01-06,98,"Homemade gnocchi for less than $.50 per person","BigSur33","I developed a recipe after reading *a lot* about making them. First bit of it is below:

1. Overall thing to keep in mind is that you want to work the dough as little as possible and 
use as little flour as possible. This will keep the gnocchi tender and light rather than 
gummy. In order to keep the flour to a minimum, you want to get rid of as much moisture 
as you can during the preparation of the potatoes. Note, this will generally not apply after 
youve formed the dough as the flour you use at that point to prevent sticking will mostly 
not be incorporated into the dough.

2. Let potatoes sit on counter for several days to dry out. Its ok if they start to sprout.

3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 

4. Pierce the potatoes all over with a fork. 

5. Place potatoes on bed of salt or rack set in a metal baking sheet (alternatively, bake 
potatoes directly on oven rack). 

6. Bake for about 1 hour, until tender.

7. Pull the potatoes out of the oven with tongs and halve the potatoes lengthwise as soon as 
they come out of the oven. You want the steam to escape from the potatoes. 

8. Do not let the potatoes cool too long. As soon as they are cool enough to handle, scoop 
all the flesh into a potato ricer (do not use a potato masher, you do not want to overwork 
the potatoes). You can also use a fine mesh strainer, the goal is to have them finely cut
with no chunks without overworking them.",1430

Dough:

- ¾ cup warm oat milk 

- 2 ¼ teaspoons active yeast 

- ¼ cup granulated sugar

- 2 large eggs 

- ¼ cup unsalted margarine 

- 3 cups all-purpose flour 

- ¼ teaspoon salt


Filling:

- 2/3 cup dark brown sugar 

- 1 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon

- ¼ cup unsalted margarine


Frosting:

- 4 oz lactose free cream cheese

- 3 tablespoons unsalted margarine 

- ¾ cup powdered sugar

- 2 tablespoons oatmilk 

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract




**Directions**


1. Warm milk until it it's warmer than your hand but not hot to touch as it will kill the yeast. For this recipe, I heat it over stove top on simmer for a couple minutes. You can also microwave it in a bowl at 20-30 second intervals.

2. Transfer warm milk to the a large bowl and sprinkle yeast on top. Wait until you can see it start to bubble and foam up. That's how you know the yeast is alive. Wait 10 minutes. While you wait, melt the margarine in a microwave so that it's room temperature for mixing later. 

3. Add in sugar, egg and melted margarine to the milk and yeast mixture. Mix until well combined. Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form.

4. Knead the dough in the bowl for about 5 minutes then transfer to a well-floured surface and knead for another 5 - 10 minutes. The dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. 

5.Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise until it is doubled in size. Mine takes 1-1.5 hours depending on how warm the kitchen is. I usually put the bowl in the microwave since it's still warm from melting the margarine. 

6. After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 14x9 inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over dough.

7. In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter.

8. Tightly roll the dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place it seam side down making sure to seal the edges of the dough.

9. Cut into 12 even sections with a aerated bread knife or floss. 

10. Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Cover with plastic wrap let rise again for 30-45 minutes.

11. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes while making the frosting. 

12. In a large bowl, soften the cream cheese and margarine then add the powdered sugar, oatmilk and vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth. Spread over cinnamon rolls and serve warm!",2785
2021-01-05,6,"Crispy Roasted Pork Belly","SomethingsBrewin","**Ingredients**

"" 1 - 1.5kg Pork Belly (preferably a even slab to allow for even cooking)

"" 1 cup of fine table salt and a pinch for marinade

"" 1 tbsp Sesame Oil

"" 1 tbsp brown sugar

"" 1 tbsp five spice powder

"" Vinegar





**Steps**
1. Cut off excess bits of pork not covered by skin
2. Blanche the pork in simmering water for 10minutes. Transfer to an ice-bath.
3. Prepare the seasoning mixture by mixing everything together. Spread it on the bottom, non-skin side of the pork belly and the sides, leaving the skin dry and untouched.
4. Apply some vinegar on the skin. (I wiped about 1-2 tbsp of vinegar on the skin). Leave overnight in the fridge to dry.
5. Next day, wrap the pork in aluminium foil up the sides, only keeping the skin uncovered. 
6. Cover the pork skin in a thick layer of salt.
7. Roast at 160C for 45minutes to 1 hour. 
8. Remove salt crust and roast again for about 20-30minutes or until appropriate at 240C, or use the broiler until appropriate. The skin should be golden and crispy. A little bit of charring is okay.
9. Remove from oven and rest for 10minutes.
10. Enjoy the goodness and all that effort.",1137

2021-01-05,82,"Instant Pot Chicken Ramen","BourgeoisieInNYC","I purposely bought mine during an Amazon July sale and it sat there for over a year... probably closer to two years, untouched.

Decided to finally cook some chicken in it, second guessing the whole time that itll work, and now I use it regularly. Granted I do go through phases where I use it almost every time I cook (I meal prep so I dont cook everyday) or I go months without touching it. But its def very handy to have!

One of my favorites and fool proof things to make is pork shoulders!  
-Wash &amp; dry meat.  
-Cut off skin and cut *the skin* into big chunks.  
-Sauté the skin, skin side down, on sauté mode. Dont even need oil since itll render the fat.  
-Then add the meat, on top of the rack, season, then cook on high for about half the time you need.  
-I usually add 1-1.5 cups of broth seasoned with the same seasoning. 1/2 cup of liquid is the minimum for cooking!  
-I always look up how many minutes per pound on the official site, do half that, then stop, quick release, turn the meat, season again, then cook for the remaining time. Natural release at the very end

Every single time Ive made this, people always love it, and Im talking licking their fingers and asking to take home some kind of good :).

A tip Ive learned: if you take the meat (any meat) out of the pot right after its done, itll fall apart *as youre trying to get it out.*  
But if you let it sit a bit, lid open, then the meat firms up a bit. Its still falling off the bones kind of soft, but it wont be disintegrating on you soft.

**Ingredients**

* 150g white chocolate
* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 1/2 tbsp oil
* 1 1/2 cup all purpose flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/3 cup almond flakes
* 1/2 cup fresh pinapple juice
* 100ml whipping cream
* 50g cream cheese
* 1/2 cup sugar

**Directions**

1. Start by making the sponge cake to give it enough time to cool down. In a large bowl beat the egg and sugar until it becomes white and foamy and double in size, add the milk and oil and mix it gently until they are well combined, then add the flour and baking powder and fold everything together, grease the heart shaped mold (not the geometric one) and add the almond flakes on top. Bake it for 25 minutes on medium heat. Once baked, remove it from the mold and brush the pineapple juice on top. Let it cool down in the refrigerator.
2. To make the filling, mix the pineapple pieces and sugar in a casserole at low heat, stir it till the pineapple pieces and soft, dissolve the corn starch in the pineapple juice and add it to the mixture and whisk until it thickens then scoop it into the heart shaped mold and let it solidify.
3. Melt the white chocolate and cover the geometric heart shaped mold and put it in the refrigerator. To make the cream, pour the whipping cream in a cold bowl and add the sugar then whisk until medium peaks are formed, add the cream cheese and fold gently with a spatula.
4. Bring out the chocolate covered mold from the refrigerator and add 2/3 of the cream, then gently put the pineapple layer on top, push down lightly. Add the remaining cream then put the cake layer. Leave it in the fridge for 2 or 3 hours, preferably a whole night.

5. With a potato peeler, peel the skin off the pears leaving the stem intact.
6. Add the pears to the liquid and simmer covered on medium-low heat for 45 minutes. Turn the pears every 10 or so minutes so have an even color on all sides.
7. Once the pears are done cooking, remove them from the heat and allow them to cool on the stove for about 15 minutes.
8. Transfer to the refrigerator and cool for an additional 2 hours.
9. Serve standing up drizzled with the sauce and a side of vanilla bean ice cream. Give people a fork and a knife because although they're tender you'll still need to cut through them.

Calories: 654kcal 

&amp;#x200B;

### Ingredients

* 1 pound shrimp peeled; tails removed or left on depending on preference
* ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
* 6 garlic cloves 3 cloves peeled and minced, 3 cloves peeled and thinly sliced
* ¼ cup unsalted butter
* ½ cup white wine or use chicken stock
* ½ cup chicken stock
* ½ lemon juiced
* 1 pound fresh tomatoes or 1 14.5 ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon capers
* Sugar to taste
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* 16 ounces pasta of your choice such as linguine, angel hair, or spaghetti
* ½ cup reserved pasta cooking water
* ¼ cup fresh parsley minced
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Olive oil

### Instructions

#### Marinate the shrimp:

* In a bowl, combine the shrimp, extra virgin olive oil, minced garlic, and salt and pepper. Toss to coat and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes.

#### Make the Pasta and Sauce:

* While the shrimp is marinating, cook the pasta according to package instructions and then drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water.
* In a skillet, toss the tomatoes in a bit of olive oil and season with salt. Transfer to the oven and roast for 20-30 minutes until blistered and browning. Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer to the stovetop.
* Using the back of your spoon, carefully mash the tomatoes and add the capers, sugar, and crushed red pepper to taste. Toss to combine. Bring to a boil over medium high and reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
* Add the reserved pasta cooking water and then toss the pasta in the sauce, using tongs to make sure the sauce coats the pasta well. Keep warm until the shrimp is ready.

#### Prepare the Shrimp:

* In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the shrimp mixture and cook in an even layer for 1 minute. Gently flip and cook for an additional minute or two, or until the shrimp is slightly undercooked but still turning pink in areas. Transfer to the shrimp to a bowl.
* Add the sliced garlic and a touch of crushed red pepper to the skillet and cook for 45 seconds over medium heat, tossing regularly to avoid burning the garlic.
* Add the wine, chicken stock, and lemon juice and bring to a boil. Cook until the sauce has reduced by about half, about 10 minutes. Add the butter and stir until melted. Gently add the shrimp and toss to coat. Cook for an additional minute or two until the shrimp are cooked through.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the pasta between bowls and top with a few shrimp and a drizzle of the butter sauce. Garnish with parsley. Enjoy!

**Ingredients**


- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour

- ½ cup dark brown sugar

- 1 tablespoon baking powder

- ½ teaspoon baking soda

- ¼ teaspoon salt

- 6 tablespoons cold margarine 

- ½-1 cup Oatmilk (this usually differs depending on how humid the kitchen is) 

- 2 large eggs

- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)

- 1 cup dark chocolate chips

- White sugar for sprinkling on scones



**Directions**



1. Chop up your margarine into small cubes then place them in the freezer, then preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Set aside.

3. In a small bowl, whisk together ½ cup of milk, eggs, and vanilla extract.

4. Remove margarine from the freezer and add the pieces to the dry ingredients. Lightly toss until all of the pieces are coated. Quickly combine your mixture until you have pea sized chunks. Do not over mix, the mixture should not be fully combined. 

5. Pour the wet mixture over the dry ingredients and use a spatula to gently stir together. Don't over stir, the mixture will be wet and sticky. If it's looking really dry, add more milk by the tablespoon until it's a wet and shaggy dough that comes together but still has some dry chunks. 

6. Stir in the chocolate chips then knead the dough a few times until the dough forms a rough circle with some dry patches. Scoop the dough out onto a lightly floured surface then gently pat and shape the dough into a ¾ inch thick circle. 

7. Generously flour a sharp knife then cut the scones into 8 even triangles. 

8. Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet and brush with 1 tablespoon of oatmilk. Sprinkle the scones with sugar. 

9. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 18-22 minutes or until the tops and edges are golden brown and the scones are set. 

10. Remove from the oven and let the scones cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. 

11. Transfer to a wire cooling rack or plate and cool completely.

12. Enjoy with some tea, I personally like English Breakfast or Earl Grey with these scones :",2330

**Yield:** 1 loaf 

**Ingredients:**

**-- Avocado layer --**

75 g (1 qty) ripe avocado without pit 

240 g (1 cup) whole milk  

3 g (1 tsp) agar-agar powder 

25 g (2 tbsp) granulated sugar 

**-- Chocolate layer --**

300 g (1¼ cup) whole milk 

3 g (1 tsp) agar-agar powder 

15 g (1¼ tbsp) granulated sugar 

75 g (2.64 oz) semi-sweet chocolate, chopped small 

**Instructions:**

**-- Avocado layer --**

1. Puree the avocado until smooth with a food processor or blender. Transfer into a bowl and set aside.
2. Boil the milk and agar-agar over medium heat. Keep stirring so that the agar-agar can dissolve properly. Once boiling, add sugar and stir until completely dissolved. 
3. Pour the hot milk into the avocado puree. Whisk until fully combined. 
4. Place a loaf pan on an angle (I use  2.75"" x 6.5"" x 2.25"" deep pan) by resting it on a larger pan (lined with kitchen rag to hold the smaller pan in place).  
5. Pour the avocado mixture into the slanted pan. It will fill the pan diagonally. Chill it in the fridge while we prepare the chocolate layer.

2. Stir in the chocolate to melt and combine well. 
3. Take the loaf pan out of the fridge. The avocado layer should have started to set. Place it in an upright position.  
4. Pour in the chocolate mixture. It should fully cover the avocado layer. Chill it in the fridge for at least 1 hour or until set. 
5. To unmold, turn the loaf pan upside down onto a plate. Wrap the pan with a hot wet towel to slightly release the mousse cake. Then hold and shake the pan until the mousse cake drops onto the plate. Alternatively, run a thin knife or spatula around the edges of the pan, then turn it out onto a plate.",1939

* 10 sea scallops

* 1 Tbsp flour
* Few slivers of habanero
* Few cilantro leaves
* Salt &amp; pepper

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Take scallops out of the fridge 20-30 minutes before cooking.  Rinse under cold water and then dry completely with a paper towel.
* Mix salt and pepper with a little bit of flour, then quickly roll the scallops in this mixture...shake off the excess, you just want a light dusting. 
* Heat butter and olive oil over medium-high to high in a non-stick frying pan.
* Once the pan gets hot, add the scallops.   You should hear a nice sizzle when they touch the pans surface.  Make sure theyre not touching each other in the pan &amp; dont move them while sizzling.
* Let them develop a nice, brown crust (the inside will stay tender and creamy), which should take about 1-½ to 2 minutes. Then you can turn them and cook for another minute. Do not overcook them!  
* Plate your scallops on a pre-heated dish, drizzle some of the pan juices over them, add a few cilantro leaves (if you have some handy; I also like chives), and add a few slivers of habanero for a little kick...its like adding wasabi to your sashimi.  ",1377

2020-12-30,1,"Vanilla Italian Macaron Shells","Regice","Video Recipe [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au98O-CR0xc&amp;feature=youtu.be)

\*\*Ingredients:\*\*

* 90 g egg whites
* 120g almond flour
* 120 g powdered sugar
* 120g sugar
* 31g water

\*\*Optional:\*\*

* Cream of Tartar (\~1/4 tsp)
* Food coloring (in gel or powdered form, not liquid)

\*\*Instructions\*\*

1. I start off by measuring out all of my ingredients prior to proceeding with any further steps, once you start the process it's usually for the best to keep going and not stop intermittently.
2. Mix the 120g of Almond Flour and 120g of Powdered sugar together in a food processor and process for \~12 intervals of 2s or so, you don't want to process it too much or the almond flour could start releasing oils and making more of a paste. This step is primarily to grind up any coarse pieces to ensure smooth macaron shells
3. Combine the 31g water with the 120g granulated sugar in a saucepan
4. Then sift the processed almond flour and powdered sugar mixture into a bowl, discard any large particles left in the sieve.
5. Separate your egg whites into two 45g sections (add any coloring you want to one section of the egg whites at this step)
6. Add one section of the egg whites (the one you added color to if you did) into the sifted almond flour and powdered sugar and mix until it forms a thick paste, cover the bowl this mixture is in with a towel or plastic wrap while you work on the merengue
7. Pour the other section of egg whites into the bowl for your stand mixer and start whisking the egg white together on a medium speed (i.e. \~5-6 on a kitchenaid). Also add your cream of tartar now if you're using it.
8. Keep whisking the eggs and gradually increasing the speed every couple minutes until you reach a medium-high speed (\~7 on a kitchenaid)
9. Once the eggs start to get foamy, start heating your saucepan with the sugar and water mixture until your syrup reaches \~118F
10. Once your syrup reaches 118F and your egg whites have been whisked to soft peaks,  bump up the kitchen aid to an 8 and slowly pour the syrup into the egg whites
11. Continue whisking the egg whites until the merengue reaches stiff peaks and the sides of your mixing bowl becomes cool to the touch (\~5-7 minutes)
12. Take a spoon or spatula of your merengue and add it to your almond paste mixture, then mix until well combined
13. Add the rest of your merengue and start the macaronage process, I'd recommend looking at some videos for this step. Basically you want to mix the batter by scooping the batter along the walls of the bowl and bring it in to the batter at the center of the bowl in a sweeping motion. You will be done with this step once your batter is roughly the consistency of running lava.
14. Once your batter is the correct consistency, transfer into a piping bag fitted with Wilton 2A piping tip (or a different one depending on what you prefer)
15. Place your parchment paper/teflon sheet/silicon mat on a metal baking sheet, and then start to pipe out your macarons by piping the batter while holding the piping bag such that it's perpendicular to your sheet.
16. Once you've finished piping the macarons, tap the baking sheet on the edges of a table or floor to induce air bubbles trapped in the piped macarons to rise to the surface. Pop those with a toothpick if necessary
17. Preheat your oven to 310-315 F\* and wait for your macarons to become dry to the touch (i.e. the batter should not stick to your finger if you touch them, usually takes around 30 min-1 hour depending on the environment).
18. Put your macarons in the oven and give them \~15-30 minutes to bake, it's dependent upon both your oven and also a check to see if they're done is to try and jiggle the top of one of the macarons to the sides gently, if it doesn't move then you should be good to go.
19. Take your macarons out of the oven and let them cool before removing them from your mat.",3903
2020-12-29,31,"Hot Pot (Part 2): How to thinly slice meats (&amp; how to use a Chinese chef knife)","madewithlau","In the process of creating this video / post, I found out that my dad used to cut 40 to 50 pounds of meat as a chef. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

The knife he's holding in the pictures is the same one he's had since he first immigrated to America, and the knife that he's been able to raise and feed our family with.

This specific post is the 2nd part of our 3 part series on **hot pot**, so the super thin cuts of meat that my dad makes are tailored for being able to cook within a matter of seconds in a boiling hot pot.

# What is Hot Pot?

If you've never heard of hot pot, the name is fairly descriptive. It's a meal where you cook your meats and vegetables as you go in a pot of flavored soup (usually on a portable hot plate. The last image in this post's carousel has an image of what our hot pot looks like.)

Its a really low stress way to have a fun and festive meal with people you love. On this particular weekend, we were celebrating my birthday, but hot pot needs no excuses to be enjoyed on any day of the year. 

# Shopping List for Hot Pot

Serves \~10-12 people

* 2 lb beef flank
* 1 lb chicken breast
* 1 lb pork chop
* 2 lb tilapia fish fillets
* 1.5 lb shrimp (31/35)
* 1.5 lb squid
* 1 lb firm tofu
* 4 oz vermicelli noodles
* 1 lb Chinese broccoli
* 0.5 lb seafood mushroom
* 0.5 lb king oyster mushroom
* 1.5 lb daikon

Fish marinade (from the video)

* 1/4 tsp salt
* dash of white pepper
* 1/4 tsp chicken bouillon
* 1 tsp cornstarch
* 2 tbsp water

Squid marinade (from the video)

* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp water

# IMPORTANT TIP for thinly slicing meat: start with partially frozen meat

Partially frozen is significantly easier to cut into thin slices, since it holds its shape when you cut it.

* Lets say you have meat thats 100% frozen and you wanted to prepare hot pot on a Saturday, On Friday night, youd move the meat out of the freezer and into the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, the meat should be partially thawed.
* If you were starting with fresh meat, then youd place it in the freezer for about one to two hours.
* With both of these methods, the amount of time you freeze and thaw depends on your refrigerator and the thickness of your meat, but this is a good starting point.
* The meat should be still hard, but it should have some give. Youll know if its still too frozen if you have a really hard time cutting it, in which case you can let it thaw for another hour or two. If the meat moves around when you try to cut it, then its too thawed, in which case you can freeze it again for another 30 minutes.

# My dad's 40 year old knife

* His knife is older than I am, which speaks to how well my dad takes care of his stuff as well as the durability of the knife.
* Its a traditional stainless steel knife made by Dexter Russell, an American brand which was and still is a popular favorite amongst Chinese American chefs, dating back to the 1800s when the first Chinese immigrants started arriving.
* Even though its sometimes called a Chinese cleaver, this type of knife is much thinner than other cleavers that are designed to hack through bones or thick meats. In Cantonese, its called a choi dMu (Ü",4040

**Ingredients**

*FOR COUSCOUS*

* 500g couscous semolina
* Olive oil
* 1 large onion, coarsely chopped
* 1 fresh tomato, peeled and coarsely chopped
* 2 to 3 tsp salt, 1 tbsp ginger, pepper and turmeric
* 1 tsp smen - Moroccan preserved butter
* 1 handful parsley and cilantro sprigs, - tied into a bouquet
* 100 g dried chickpeas, soaked overnight
* 1 small head of cabbage, cut in quartered
* 2 turnips, peeled and cut in half
* 2 carrots, peeled and cut in half
* 1 small butternut squash
* 1 small zucchini, ends trimmed

*FOR TFAYA*

* 100g raisins, soaked in water for 15 minutes
* 2 or 3 large onions
* 0.5 tbsp pepper, cinnamon, ginger and turmeric
* 1 pinch salt
* 1 small cup of sugar

**Directions**

1. Drizzle 1/4 cup of olive oil over the couscous. Toss and roll the couscous around between your hands for a minute to distribute the oil evenly and break up any balls or clumps. Add 1 cup of water and work it into the couscous in the same waytossing and rubbing the couscous until all is well blended and there are no clumps.
2. Soak the dried chickpeas in a large bowl of water overnight. (Or, use a quick soak method: boil the dried chickpeas for 4 or 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and leave them to soak for an hour.)
3. Wash and prep your vegetables. Brown with the oil, onion, tomatoes and spices in the base of a couscoussier over medium-high heat. Continue cooking, uncovered and stirring frequently, for about 10 to 15 minutes, until a very thick and rich sauce begins to form.
4. Add the soaked, drained chickpeas along with the parsley/cilantro bouquet and about 3 quarts (or liters) of water. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook over medium heat for about 30 minutes
5. Transfer the couscous to a lightly oiled steamer basket, taking care not to compress the grains in the process. Place the basket on the couscoussier and steam for 15 to 20 minutes, timing from when the steam first appears over the couscous.
6. Turn the couscous back into your gsaa or bowl. Allow it to cool briefly, then work in 1 cup of water, using the same tossing and turning as you did before. (You may need to use a wooden spoon if the couscous is too hot, but move to using your hands when it has cooled enough.)
7. Add the turnips and carrots to the pot; cover and allow them to cook for 15 minutes while you work with the couscous. Taste the couscous for salt and add a little more if desired. Transfer the couscous to the steamer basket, again being careful not to pack the grains.
8. Once the steam begins to emerge from the couscous, add the remaining vegetables to the potthe squash or pumpkin, the zucchini. Top with a little water if the level has dropped below the vegetables. Taste and adjust seasoningit should be well flavored, a bit salty and peppery.
9. To make tfaya (caramelized onions with raisins), combine all tfaya ingredients in a small pot. Cover and simmer over a medium-low heat until the onions and raisins are tender and liquids have reduced to a thick syrup.",3126

- 3 Tbsp sugar

Topping 

- 2 tsp matcha (for dusting)



**Directions**


Batter

1. Add the milk and sugar in a small sauce pan and combine well. Heat on medium heat until the milk is warm to touch.

2. Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Then slowly add small amount of warm milk while whisking. While whisking, slowly add the melted butter to the mixture.

3. Set up a fine-mesh sieve over the bowl and add cake flour, matcha powder, and baking powder. Sift half of the dry ingredients into the batter and whisk to combine the dry and wet ingredients together.

4. Sift the rest of dry ingredients and mix until there is no lump in the batter. 

5. Set the fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl and pour the batter. This will remove any lumps and get a smooth texture. Cover with plastic wrap to refrigerate for at least 1 hour 

Cooking the Crepes 

1. Set a 12-inch non-stick frying pan on low heat. Pour 1/3 cup of batter just enough to cover the bottom of the frying pan,

3. Repeat step 1 and 2 with a 10-inch pan and pour 1/4 cup of batter. Continue this process until all the batter is used. 

Whipped Cream

1. Add the heavy whipping cream and start whisking on lower speed. Once you see bubbles, slowly add granulated sugar. Whip the cream until stiff. 

Assembly

1. First place the larger crepe. This will be the top layer when we flip. Put the freshly whipped cream in the middle and spread evenly, leaving outer 2 inch.

2. Place another crepe on top and spread whip cream evenly, leaving outer ½ inch.
Continue this process until the last crepe is placed on top.

3. Prepare a round curved shallow dish and place a large piece of plastic wrap on top. Make sure to remove any air pockets and smooth out. Transfer the mille crepe to the shallow dish 

4. Wrap the mille crepe with plastic wrap from one corner to clockwise. 

5. Chill in fridge then flip over again before dusting with matcha to serve.",2489

* Pre-heat oven to 375°F (190C). Lay out **the onions** on a parchment lined baking sheet, drizzle **.5 tbs olive oil** and season with **¼ tsp salt**. Mix to coat onions then spread out the onions into a thin layer. Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes.
* Remove from the oven and remove the foil cover. Toss onions around a bit then gather them to form a flat even layer. Besure not to leave any stray onions as they will burn in the oven. Increase oven temp to 425°F (218C) bake for 30 minutes, mixing half way through. If onions have not caramelized after 30 minutes (they will turn dark brown) mix the onion again and return to the oven for another 10 minutes.
* Meanwhile, **place bacon slices on a sheet of foil.** Spread them out evenly. Fold in the sizes of the foil to avoid any rendered fat from leaking out. Place in the oven with the onions for 15 minutes then take it out and discard rendered fat.
* Cool onion and bacon components before assemblings the galette. Turn oven to 400°F. **Cut the puff pastry** in half to make two rectangles. Divide and spoon the caramelized onions onto each pasty sheet along with the bacon. Fold in the sides of the pastry, then push the onion and bacon towards the edge of the pastry to make a well for the eggs. **Carefully crack the eggs in the well** you made. Brush the pastry with egg wash then bake for 15 minutes at 400°F. To serve, season with salt and pepper, garnish with chives and serve hot!",1792

While I love a good seared scallop, these poached scallops in spicy dashi broth are unbelievably delicious  with no frying necessary.

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Servings: 4

Calories: 416kcal

**Equipment:**

* Medium pot

**Instructions:**

1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the barley and return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook over a vigorous simmer for 30-35 minutes. Check the barley after 25 minutes and cook until the barley is tender yet chewy. Turn off the heat and drain the barley.
2. While the barley is cooking, prepare the dashi broth. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 5-7 minutes until softened and beginning to brown.
3. Add the garlic, ginger, and Thai chili pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
4. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil.
5. Pour in the prepared dashi stock, soy sauce, mirin, and sesame oil. Reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes. Taste and season with salt, if necessary.

7. Taste the broth and season again to your preferences. Pat the scallops dry and season lightly with salt. Nestle the scallops in the broth. Cover and cook for 5-6 minutes until opaque and cooked through. Turn off the heat and remove the lid.
8. Divide the cooked barley between shallow bowls and ladle the broth on top. Arrange the scallops on each dish and garnish with the daikon radish, spooning a bit of the chili oil from the radish over the scallops. Arrange scallions or pea shoots on each dish. Enjoy!

- 4 lamb chops or 2 shoulder chops
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp chopped fresh mint
- 1 tbsp minced garlic 
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- salt &amp; pepper
- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 1/4 cup red wine optional

- 4 medium potatoes
- 1/4 cup duck fat
- salt &amp; pepper

The lamb:

- Make a rub with the oil, mint, garlic, coriander, turmeric, cayenne, cinnamon, and salt and pepper.
- Rub the mixture on the chops and let it sit for around an hour. 
- Turn the oven on to 425.
- Sear the chops in a hot pan with oil. (I used my cast iron pan so I could put it straight in the oven).
- Slowly pour about 1/2 a cup of chicken stock over the seared chops. 
- Put them in the oven until the internal temp is 150 or so (or however you like your lamb). 
- Remove from the oven and let them rest. 
- Optional: deglaze the pan with a bit of red wine and use it as a sauce.

The potatoes:

- Cut up the potatoes into even sized pieces.
- Put them in a pot and add cold water just enough to cover them.
- Add some salt and bring them to a boil on med-high heat. 
- Dial down the temp and simmer for 8-10 min, depending on how big the pieces are, you want them about half-cooked. 
- Drain the potatoes well, and rough up the outsides with the colander. The idea is to let the duck fat crisp up the outside so the more beat up they are the better.
- Put the duck fat in the bottom of a roasting pan, big enough to cook the potatoes in a single layer. 
- Put the pan in the oven WITHOUT THE POTATOES YET and get the duck fat sizzling hot.
- Once the fat is hot, CAREFULLY add the potatoes.
- Stir them so the fat gets all over the potatoes, and put them back in the hot oven. 
- Turn the potatoes occasionally so they get nice and crispy all over. 
- Sprinkle a little salt and pepper on them after they come out of the oven if you like.",1881

2020-12-28,31,"[Monday] What are your recipe questions?","InsaneGoblin","Prawn Cocktail, molecular edition! 

My GF loves this simple dish, and as she's a gourmet, so for New Year's, I wanted to heavily evolve it to look more like something out of a Michelin Star restaurant. Just bought myself a bunch of chemicals to do spherification, gelification and other fancy stuff. Here is the idea:

Note: the prawn cocktail we know and love is simply boiled/poached prawns on lettuce, with some pink sauce (mayo+ketchup+tabasco+lemon).

So, decomposing the dish, it's quite simple, as it has only three parts. Let's go one by one:

Prawns: was thinking of keeping it very simple: par boiled and finished with some butter searing. 

Sauce: either simply placed as a base beneath the rest, or reverse spherification, due to the possibly high calcium and fat content. Do I need some sodium citrate to elevate the PH and stabilise it, due to the lemon acidity?

Lettuce: this is very tricky as lettuce shouldn't be cooked. Because of this, I could change it to some other vegetable and do a foam, served on the side? Problem of the foam is that it will be difficult to eat with the other spheres. What about in gel form? Kinda like a pea puree, much softer and smoother, gelified. 

Extra: with the prawn heads, I was thinking of doing some normal spherification, served alongside or on top of the prawns. Maybe a simple bisque-turned-caviar? Could it work? If too weird, can go at the base, placed with a brush. 

Note: I suck at plating. Ideas more than welcome!",1481

1 knob ginger, peeled and grated

4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 jalapeno or Serrano, de-seed and chopped (optional)

1 can garbanzo beans, drained

1-2 lbs beef stew meat

Curry leaves

4-6 cups chicken stock 

4-6 cups coconut milk

Curry powder

Salt

Pepper

Olive oil

Worcestershire sauce

Rice:

2 cups rice, I prefer basmati rice

2.5 cups water

2 cloves garlic flattened down with a flat knife

Ghee

Panch Puran or Indian five spice (optional)

Pickled ginger

Instructions;

Curry:

1. Season beef with salt and pepper and then coat in flour.

2. In a soup pot or Dutch oven heat a few tablespoons of olive oil on medium. Turn the heat to medium-high and brown the meat on all sides making sure not to over crowd pan. 

3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit

4. Once the meat is browned place in a bowl off to the side and add all the vegetables to the pot along with the curry leaves and some sprinkles of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until veggies soften and add a few heaping tablespoons of curry powder to taste. 

5. Add coconut milk, chicken stock, garbanzo beans, and the browned meat. Cover and braise in oven until meat is tender; around an hour and a half to two hours

6. Remove the taste and season with salt and pepper as well as a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce for some added acidity and serve.

Rice:

(If using basmati rice soak in cold water for 10 minutes. If not make sure rinse the rice until the water runs clear)

1. In a sauce pot, heat a few tablespoons of ghee until hot; be careful not to let it burn, ghee has a low smoke point.

2. Add garlic and cook to flavor the ghee for a couple minutes and I add Indian five spice if using.

3. Add the rice and toast for a couple minutes until it smells nutty, careful to watch for any burning.

2020-12-27,4,"V. Hot Thai Jungle Curry with Smoked Mackerel","danos95","This is a recipe for a Thai jungle curry. This type of curry is typically very, very spicy; loaded with a lot of fresh birds-eye chillies. Plus, no coconut milk is used so there is nothing to cut through the heat of all the chillies.   
  
The recipe below is fairly true to tradition. Accordingly there are some obscure ingredients that you will only find at an East Asian grocer (if you live outside of Asia) and for those ingredients I have given reliable, more accessible substitutes. Finally, I have used smoked fish here but this dish is very versatile: sliced chicken, pork, duck, beef also work very well. 

Prep Time: 50 minutes

Cook Time: 10 minutes

Total Time: 60 minutes

Servings: 2

## EQUIPMENT

- Mortar &amp; Pestle (preferred) OR Food Processor   
  
## INGREDIENTS

- 2 tbs veg oil 

- 2 tbs fish sauce

- pinch of sugar

- 1 cup of chicken stock

- 1 fillet of smoked fish of any kind, broken up into rough chunks

- 2 snake beans OR green beans cut into 1inch lengths

- 1.5 tbs chopped thai shallot OR normal shallot

- 2 tbs chopped garlic

- 1.5 tsp shrimp paste

## INSTRUCTIONS 

## MAKE THE CURRY PASTE

- If using a mortar and pestle pound each ingredient into a fine paste before moving onto the next one. Do it in the order I have listed above (i.e. chillies first, lemongrass second etc). The shrimp paste can be just folded in with a spoon. 

- If using a food processor or blender just add all ingredients in at once and blend to a puree. 

## MAKING THE JUNGLE CURRY

- Heat a saucepan over medium heat. Add oil and fry paste for 1-2 minutes until you sneeze or cough (yes it will definitely happen). 

- Season with fish sauce and sugar. 

- Add stock, bring to a boil. 

- Add snake beans, eggplants and simmer for 2 minutes. 

- Add smoked fish, fingerroot if using, green peppercorns and Thai parsely (or coriander) and give everything a good mix.

2020-12-27,7,"Sweet and Savoury Cola Wings","_adventurousbaker_","ASMR video recipe [here](https://youtu.be/QoCHfU-zvOg)

**Ingredients** **(makes 3 servings)**

* 1lb chicken wings
* 2 tbsp cooking wine
* Ginger
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp light soy sauce
* 1 tsp dark soy sauce
* 500ml cola wings
* 1 green onion (garnish)

**Directions**

1. Begin by parboiling the chicken wings as a means of cleaning them. Place room temperature chicken wings into cold water and turn the stove to high. Optionally add a tsp of Chinese cooking wine (Shaoxing wine) to the wings to better rid the meat of any unpleasant aromas. Once the water boils, let the wings remain there for about a minute so that a whitish brown foam develops, and then remove the wings from the boiling water.
2. Rinse the wings with cold water to remove the remainder of the foam and blood that came out in the previous step. Using cold water also helps shock the meat and preserve a more crisp and tender texture.
3. Cut a few slices of ginger, slice 2 cloves of garlic. Place into the wings and then add 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp light soy sauce, 1 tsp dark soy sauce, 1tbsp cooking wine. Mix thoroughly and then add in around 500ml of cola or enough to just cover the top of the wings. Marinate in this solution for at least 1 hour in the fridge.
4. Dice a green onion on a clean cutting board into thin slices, cover, and set aside for garnish at the end. Alternatively, you may prepare this near the end so that it's more fresh.
5. After marinating, remove the wings from the liquid and set aside. Cook the marinade and reduce it on high heat until there's only about a half cup left. Watch and stir as necessary to prevent drying out and burning. Set aside when done.
6. Add around 1 tbsp oil to a hot pan and add in the wings. Pan fry for \~10m on medium high heat, moving the wings often to prevent burning. When the wings are cooked, turn the heat to high and pour in the reduced marinade. You can check that the wings are cooked by finding a thick section of meat and poking into it with a fork or chopstick. If any juices that come out are clear, as opposed to pink, then the meat is cooked.
7. Stir and fold constantly to get the wings covered with the marinade. When the sauce thickens, turn off the flame and plate. Pour the sauce from the bottom of the pan onto the wings and garnish with some fresh green onion.",2328
2020-12-27,1,"Perfect sugar cookies","Odeiminmukwa","This is my great-grandmas recipe and as long as you follow the directions, its very faithful. There are a few keys however to getting them perfect every time:  

Dough consistency: when finished mixing, it should be firm enough that it doesnt stick to your hands, but is still pliable.  

Cookie thickness: make sure to roll it out to the recommended 1/4.  

Baking time: keep a close eye on your first batch. Oven temps vary. I find 10 minutes is too long, 8 seems to be the magic number for me.   

Refrigerating the dough:  dont skimp on the chilling time or your dough will be too soft to be workable.  


Be aware that this recipe makes like 3-4 dozen cookies. I always halve or third it if only baking for less than 4 people.  


Cookie recipe:  

-2 cups flour  

-1/4 tsp salt if using unsalted butter; pinch of salt if using salted butter  

-1/2 baking powder  

-1/2 cup butter  

-1 cup granulated sugar (I usually cut back by about 1/4 cup, as I find they are plenty sweet once the icing is on)  

-1 egg  

-2 tbsp milk (I use 2%, but not terribly important)  

-1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract  

Whisk all dry ingredients together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix in egg, milk and vanilla. Slowly add dry ingredients to wet. Shape dough into 2 discs and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350F. Roll dough out onto floured surface 1/4 thick. Cut out into desired shapes. Put on parchment lined baking sheet and bake 10 minutes or until edges start to brown.  

Royal icing recipe  

(Note: royal icing is very hard to get right for beginners. Dont be dismayed if it doesnt work out the first time.)  

I usually do the traditional piped outlines and flooded center, but if you have no one to impress you can lazy spread the icing with a spoon as I did here in my pre-Xmas baking rush. It still tastes great.  If youre not making the full cookie recipe, I highly recommend halving the icing recipe. It makes a lot.  



-1/4 cup meringue powder (available at bulk ingredient stores like Bulk Barn)  

4 &amp; 2/3 cup icing sugar  

Beat meringue powder with 1/2 cup water until foamy (this step is very important in getting your icing to set!). Beat in icing sugar until stiff. Cover with damp cloth to prevent drying.",2271

* parsley to garnish
* pickled jalapeno to garnish
* mashed potato to serve

=÷

**Instructions:**

**1.** Heat the frying pan to very high and sear the ribs on each side until golden brown. Once ready, transfer to a spare pot leaving the rendered fat behind.

**2.** Next, lower the heat slightly and fry the mirepoix to colour then transfer to spare pot.

**3.** Add **1tbsp** of canola oil and stir-fry peppers until coloured then transfer to spare pot.

**4.** Lower the heat to medium and add **2tbsp** of canola oil and **5tsp** of paprika, mix it together and cook until aroma heats your nose, don't burn it.

**5.** Transfer all the ingredients back to the braising pan and pour in enough stock to cover everything to **3/4**.

**6.** Add caraway, bay leaves, allspice and black pepper. Bring the temperature to just under the boiling point, cover with a lid and cook for **2-3 hours** or until the meat starts to fall off the bone (during that time you may need to add more stock to keep cooking liquid at **3/4 level**).

**7.** When ready mix couple of tablespoons of gravy powder with a little bit of water (enough to make it runny) and gently stir it into the ribs (add enough to thicken the sauce)

**8.** Remove from the heat and allow to rest for **30 minutes** before serving.

=÷=÷

**Insight:**

* Try it with pasta it works very well on the second day!
* For slow braising reduce the temperature to **80C (176F)** and extend cooking time to 6-8 hours.

Directions:

1. Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk. Mix the salt, sugar, flour and milk together. Add one egg and mix well. Cover the dough and let it rest for 20 min.
2. Add 2 tbsps melted butter, knead the dough to absorb the oil. Keep kneading until smooth (This step took me 5 min).
3. Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place (80-90°F) for 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.
4. Knead the dough, remove the air bubbles until the size of the dough is almost the same as before the rise. Divide the dough into four pieces evenly.
5. Take one piece, cover the rest with a towel to keep the moisture. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a big rectangular shape. Spread a thin layer of Nutella on top.
6. Shaping the bread: Start from one end of the dough, roll it up, and seal the seam. Stretch the dough into 1-foot long. Cut it in half longitudinally, keep one end connected. Braid the two-strand bread, left goes right, right goes left, keep crossing them. Maker sure to keep the longitudinal section always facing up. After braiding the dough, pinch both ends together.
7. Final proof in a warm environment for 40 min. Brush on a thin layer of the egg wash. Bake for 18 min at 375°F.

2020-12-26,1,"Feywild Eggs, from the official DND book, with a few tweaks! Recipe below","Smashrican","Feywild Eggs (with what I had available) 

Prep time- 7 min 
Cook time- 5-7 min on stovetop, 14-22min in oven 

9 eggs

2 slices of ham, chopped

1/4 tsp salt 

1/4 pepper 

2 table spoons of avocado oil

1 yellow onion, chopped, 

1/3 tsp each Mixed Herbs such as oregano, rosemary, and parsley (the exact 3 I used)

1/4 cup mozzarella cheese 

1/4 cup Monterey Jack or fiesta blend cheese 

Milk or almond milk is optional and will take longer to cook. 

Oven safe skillet or Dutch oven

Directions: 

In a skillet that is oven safe for 400, add your oil and when its up to heat, add your onions, and cook until soft. 
In a mixing bowl, add your 9 eggs, mozzarella cheese, and herbs, salt and pepper and mix evenly. 
Add a dash a milk or almond milk for additional creaminess, but not needed. 

When the onions are softer or browned, add your ham (but a lot of people add it first with the onions, either way is great!) 
After the ham is browned, add your egg mix. 

After a brief stir, let it sit for about a minute or until bubbles appear at the edges and center.  I used a classic Dutch oven, or caldero in my language. It took about a minute while covered. When the bubbles are present, add the Monterey or fiesta blend cheese so it coats the top well. This will end up making a great crust on top for this. After this, take the lid off, and stick it in the oven, for about 14 minutes. 

Check around 11 minutes in to see your crust forming. After the full 14 minutes, stick a knife down the center, it may appear extremely watery, while the edges are settled. Do not be alarmed, just let it sit longer, up to 8 mins longer. In a skillet it shouldnt appear watery or need the extra 8 min. Using a caldero or Dutch oven, you definitely will. The bonus of the Dutch oven is that it will give this frittata a very airy poof. 

After it is fully cooked at the center, or as cooked as you prefer, remove, and gentley with a rubber spatula, circle the border. It will come out nicely and even if it feels like its breaking, slide it out. Both times Ive made this, Ive only had a minor slice from my trying too hard to get it out, so definitely take a second to let it sit if you are struggling. It will come out. 

Let sit til cool, slice and enjoy!",2254

Author: Kylie Perrotti

## Equipment

* Wide skillet

## Ingredients

## Spicy Thai Basil Squid:

* 2-3 tablespoons neutral cooking oil for frying, add more as needed
* 2 shallots peeled and sliced into thin wedges
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 3 Thai chili peppers trimmed and minced (use fewer chili peppers if you want it less spicy)
* 3.5 ounces maitake mushrooms torn, or use sliced shiitake caps or sliced cremini mushrooms
* 1 pound cleaned squid bodies sliced into rounds, tentacles left whole or chopped in half if desired
* 2 teaspoons good quality fish sauce
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* S cup water
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Cooked white rice for serving
* Scallions minced, for garnish

## Instructions

## Cook the Aromatics:

* Heat two teaspoons of oil in a wide skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the shallot and cook for 3-4 minutes until golden brown and softened.
* Add the garlic and chili peppers to the skillet and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Do not burn the garlic! Immediately transfer to a bowl.

## Cook the Mushrooms:

* Heat another teaspoon or two of oil in the skillet and add the mushrooms. Cook for 4-5 minutes until beginning to crisp up and turn golden brown. Transfer to the bowl with the aromatics and season everything with a sprinkle of salt.

## Cook the Squid:

* Pat the squid dry thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Heat another teaspoon or two of oil in the skillet. Once hot, add half the squid and arrange into an even layer in the skillet. Cook without moving for 3 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, toss the squid in the skillet and cook an additional minute or until the squid is barely cooked through.
* Transfer the squid to the bowl with the aromatics and mushrooms. Cook the remaining squid the same way you cooked the first batch and transfer it to the bowl.

## Cook the Sauce:

* While the squid cooks, combine the fish sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, and sesame oil in a bowl. Turn the heat on the skillet to medium. Pour in the sauce and water and bring to a boil. Stir to scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet.

## Finish the Spicy Squid:

* Add the squid and aromatics and mushrooms to the sauce and toss to combine. Turn the heat to medium-low. Tear the Thai basil leaves in half and add to the skillet. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring regularly, until the leaves are wilted. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if necessary. Turn off the heat.

## To Serve:

* Serve the spicy squid over cooked rice and garnish with minced scallion. Enjoy!

2020-12-25,62,"Cozonac, traditional Romanian Xmas treat","ShortcakeRoyale","The ""cozonac"" is found everywhere in Romania - it's made every time we're celebrating something important, such as Christmas.

The ones I made here are filled with a walnut and cocoa paste, flavored with vanilla and rum essence. Other varieties exist, such as the very popular turkish delight cozonac.

It's a difficult dough to knead by hand because it requires lots of effort and strong arms. I'd rather not attempt it without a stand mixer but that is up to you. The short story is: you want to knead it until you're able to grab a piece with both hands and stretch it to a semi-transparent film that doesn't break.

Here is a video version of the recipe, which should help especially when it comes to rolling the cozonac. It's in Romanian but I translated the steps.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa6HlVP5LV0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa6HlVP5LV0)

Ingredients for two small or a single large cozonac:

*For the dough:*

* 500 to 550 grams of flour (I used ""000"" flour which I think is equivalent to ""pastry flour"")
* 250ml milk
* 8 egg yolks (size M)
* 100g powdered sugar
* 25g granulated sugar
* 25g fresh yeast (or the equivalent dry yeast, as indicated on the package)
* 100g butter
* 25ml oil with neutral taste (such as refined sunflower oil - note that unrefined sunflower oil does carry taste and smell)
* 1 tbsp rum essence
* 1 tbsp vanilla essence
* the zest of a lemon, a similarly sized orange or a combination of the two
* a good pinch of salt

*For the walnut filling:*

* 350g crushed walnuts, I like them very finely crushed but you can leave some chunks in if you want
* 100ml milk
* 200g granulated sugar
* 1 tbsp cocoa powder (I used dark cocoa powder)
* 1 tbsp rum essence
* 1 tbsp vanilla essence
* 2 egg whites (size M)

You'll need some oil, a yolk or two and some milk for finishing as well.

Steps (dough):

1. Place 50g of the flour in a bowl, and get 100ml of milk boiling. Once boiling, pour it over the flour and mix well. Take 25g of yeast and 25g of granulated sugar and beat them together until you get a liquid. You can do this in the same bowl if you're sure the yeast won't touch the hot flour paste. Wait until the flour paste has cooled down and then combine the two together, spread some flour on top, cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size. This will be our ""scalded starter mix"".
2. Once that's done, place the remaining flour in your stand mixer's bowl, together with the lemon/orange zest. Mix on the lowest speed, just to combine.
3. Beat the egg yolks with a good pinch of salt, the oil, the rum and vanilla essences and then mix with 150ml of lukewarm or room temperature milk.
4. Add the liquid mixture obtained above to the stand mixer bowl, together with the scalded starter mix that should've risen by now. Turn on the stand mixer on low at first, and gradually increase the speed to a medium-high, until all ingredients are completely combined.
5. Keep mixing, add the powdered sugar, half of it at a time.
6. Once the powdered sugar has been added, continue mixing on a high speed for another 10 minutes.
7. You may need, every now and then, to stop the mixer and scrape the dough from the bowl and the attachment. This dough is very very sticky. At the end we'll cover our table in oil and the thing will most likely still stick to it in some places.
8. After 10 minutes it's time to add the butter, in small chunks. Don't add the next chunk until the previous is completely incorporated.
9. Once the butter has been completely incorporated, keep mixing at high speed for another 15 minutes. Unless you've chosen to do it by hand, in which case you'll have to give the dough a real good smashing for 45 whole minutes. You're pretty badass if you chose this route, not gonna lie.
10. Remember the doneness test: you want to knead it until you're able to grab a piece with both hands and stretch it to a semi-transparent film that doesn't break.

Place the dough in a bowl that's been greased with oil, cover with a towel, and let to rise until doubled in size in a warm place.

Steps (filling):

1. Place the crushed walnuts in a bowl.
2. Bring 100ml of milk and 200g granulated sugar to a boil, mixing continuously to dissolve the sugar properly.
3. Pour the hot milk &amp; sugar mixture onto the walnuts and mix well.
4. Add the cocoa powder, vanilla and rum essences, the two egg whites, and mix again. Some people choose to beat the egg whites first, I added them as they came out of the egg. Works either way.

Final steps (refer to the video I linked above to best get these steps right):

1. The dough should've risen by now. Spread some oil on your working surface, take the dough out of the bowl and spread it into a rectangular shape that's fairly thin. You can do this by hand because the dough is extremely easy to shape.
2. If you want to make two portions, cut the rectangle in two. Once rolled, the dough should fit in your rectangular loaf tins so keep this in mind.
3. Cover the dough with the walnut filling, leaving out a couple of centimeters around the filling to help with the rolling.
4. Roll from top to bottom, constantly bringing the sides of the rectangle towards the inside.
5. Make sure you've rolled it well and securely sealed it.
6. Place a baking sheet in your pan, making sure to cover the sides properly, then very carefully place the rolled up cozonac in it. Careful, it's fragile, so get your fingers underneath it from the get-go.
7. Beat an egg yolk with a tablespoon or two of milk, and carefully brush the surface of the cozonac.
8. Let it sit covered in a warm place for 45 mins or so, or until it increased in size and reached the top of the pan.
9. In the meantime, preheat your oven to 190 degrees celsius.
10. Get the cozonac in the oven, and let it bake for about 10 minutes, at which point you want to cover it with aluminium foil and bake for another 40 minutes.
11. Take out of the oven, let cool down a bit in the tin, then take them out and let cool further on a rack.

Normally you don't cut into them until they're completely cooled, but rules are made to be broken. I like to eat pieces of the crust while it's still hot. Enjoy!",6186

Crust Ingredients

C 1 cup melted butter (two sticks)

C 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

C 1/4 cup cocoa powder (sifted)

C 1/2 cup powdered sugar

C 1 tsp salt

4. Add in your melted butter and vanilla and stir until incorporated. It should form a somewhat wet and malleable dough.

5. Take your dough and press it into the sides and bottom of your tart pan, forming an even layer all around. You can use a knife to trim any excess crust that overhangs off the sides.

6. Place your tart pan on a sheet tray and layer a sheet of parchment on your crust. Fill the tart shell with your pie weights, making sure the parchment lays in between.

7. Place your tart in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. The tart shell may be slightly soft coming out of the oven but will firm up as it cools.

Filling Ingredients

C 1 1/2 cups coconut milk

C 2 7/8 cups (16 ounces) chopped dark chocolate or chocolate chips

C 1 tsp vanilla extract

C 1 1/2 tsp mint extract

C 1/4 tsp salt

C 1/2 tsp instant espresso powder (optional)

Directions

1. Heat coconut milk in the microwave for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until very hot.

2. Pour coconut milk over the bowl of chocolate. Place a plate on top of the bowl to trap in heat and let the chocolate melt for 5 minutes. Then stir until completely smooth. If there are still chunks of chocolate, pop the bowl into the microwave for 30 second intervals (stirring in between) until melted.

3. Whisk in vanilla extract, mint extract, espresso powder, and salt.

4. Pour chocolate ganache mixture into cooled tart crust.

5. Place in the refrigerator for at least two hours until ganache has set and firmed up in the center.

6. Once chocolate has firmed up, you can slice and serve. I decorated mine with melted white chocolate, but you can serve yours with flaky sea salt or simply plain.",2161

Caramel 

Ingredients

- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 2 tbsp milk
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- salt to taste

Directions

1) Add brown sugar, butter, and milk to a saucepan.
2) Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook for 1-2 minutes until thickened.
3) Take off heat and whisk in your vanilla and salt.

Ingredients

- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 1/2 tsp espresso powder
- 3/4 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 large eggs
- 7/8 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup oil
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup buttermilk

Directions

1) Preheat your oven to 350F and line a cupcake tray with liners. This recipe makes roughly 10 cupcakes.
2) Sift your flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Then whisk to combine.
3) In another bowl, whisk together your eggs, sugar, oil, and vanilla until well-incorporated.
4) Add your wet ingredients to your dry ingredients, followed by your buttermilk. Whisk everything together until smooth. Avoid mixing any further than this.
5) Evenly divide your batter into cupcake liners (I use an ice cream scoop to do this) and bake for about 18-20 minutes. When done, the cupcakes should spring back, and a toothpick inserted in the center should not come out with wet batter. Be careful not to over-bake.
6) Set cupcakes aside to cool before frosting.

Ingredients

- 3 egg whites
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- pinch of salt
- 1/2 tsp lemon juice (or white vinegar)
- 10 tbsp softened unsalted butter
- 3/4 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tbsp espresso powder

Directions

1) Separate your egg whites from the yolks, making sure not a single drop of yolk ends up in the whites. Use a heatproof bowl like metal for the egg whites. Reserve yolks for another purpose.
2) Add in the sugar and set the bowl over a pot that is simmering with a couple inches of water.
3) Whisk the egg whites and sugar constantly until all the sugar is dissolved. You can use your fingers to feel if there are still granules of sugar in the egg mixture. Then take it off the pot.
4) Add in your salt and lemon juice. Then on medium-high speed, beat the mixture until it reaches stiff peaks. You know you have reached this stage when you can overturn the bowl and none of the meringue falls out. Avoid over-beating.
5) Add in your softened butter about a tablespoon at a time, making sure you mix in between each tablespoon.
6) Add in your vanilla extract and espresso powder and mix.

Assembly 

1) In a piping bag fitted with an injector tip, fill the center of your cupcake with caramel sauce. You may need to pop the caramel in the microwave for about 30 seconds to make it loose enough to pipe.
2) Then decorate the tops of your cupcakes with the espresso buttercream.",2923

2020-12-23,40,"Homemade Italian Tortellini","italian_cook","Tortellini is the most famous italian stuffed pasta and this is the classic recipe to do them at home. The ingredients are simple and genuine, the making of tortellini requires a little time and commitment but the taste worth the effort without doubt.

Fun fact: Legend claims that Tortellini was inspired by the goddess Venus' navel. One evening after a day of battle between Bologna and Modena, Venus, Bacchus and Mars found refreshment at the inn Corona in Castelfranco Emilia. The next morning Mars and Bacchus moved away from the inn leaving Venus dormant;

When she woke up, she called the other companions to hear where they were. the innkeeper came to see if he could help and saw the little-dressed goddess was so impressed by its splendid shapes that he returned to the kitchen and created a pasta inspired by Venus' navel&and so was born the Tortellini.

Serving for about 6 persons

**INGREDIENTS**

For the filling

* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) pork loin
* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) mortadella
* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )
* 150 gr ( 5.29 ounce ) grated parmigiano
* 10 gr ( 0.35 ounce )  butter
* 2 eggs
* nutmeg
* black pepper
* salt

&amp;#x200B;

For the dough

* 320 gr ( 11.29 ounce ) all-purpose  flour
* 80 gr ( 2.82 ounce ) semolina flour
* 4 eggs
* 25 gr ( 0.88 ounce ) extra virgin olive oil
* salt

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTION**

* in a pan put 10 gr butter and 100 gr pork loin diced
* let the pork loin brown well and drain from the excess of butter
* in a meat grinder put the pork loin, 100 gr mortadella and 100 gr cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )
* add to the mixture half nutmeg grated, 150 gr grated parmigiano, black pepper and 2 eggs
* Mix well the mixture and add salt if needed ( you should taste the mixture because the flavor can vary depending on the type of cured ham and mortadella)
* cover with a plastic wrap and let it rest for 2 hours

Now let's prepare the homemade pasta as usual so 1 egg every 100 gr flours. For the flours we will use all-purpose and semolina flour in a proportion 4 to 1 so for this filling about 320 gr all-purpose and 80 gr semolina flour

* Put the flours on a pastry board making a hole in the center where you will put 4 whole eggs and 25 gr extra virgin olive oil.
* With a fork amalgamate the eggs and let the flour be incorporated, salt the dough and continue this operation until it will be possible to work it by hand.
* work the dough until it is smooth and even. Leave it to rest in a film in the fridge for 30 minutes at least.
* work the dough with a rolling pin and divide in several part
* now with the help of a pasta machine begin to lower the thickness of the dough
* the dough will be ready when it is less of one millimetre thick. I usually use the lower setting of thickness
* now cut the pasta dough to obtain squares 4 cm long, i use a pasta cutter to obtain several squares at the time and speed up the process
* Take a pasta square and put a little of filling in the middle then fold the square into a triangle. Finally, roll up the triangle and join the angles creating the typical shape of the tortellini like you can see in the video
* if the pasta dries too much you can moisten the edges of the dough square with a finger wetted in a little water. this will help to seal the tortellini.
* Put the tortellini on a tray lined with parchment paper. If you want you can also frozen tortellini, to do so put the tray in freezer a few hours, in this way they will remain intact and will not stick during freezing, when the tortellini are well frozen you can transfer them in bags to save space in the freezer
* Cook tortellini into boiling beef and poultry stock. If frozen, do not unfreeze.
* You can also prepare tortellini without broth. Cook them in abundant salted water, when they are ready ( 4/5 minutes usually) drain them and season with a heavy cream sauce with ham and peas. If you want more precise instruction for this kind of seasoning ask in the comment section

**Cook the Pasta:**

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente and reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water. Drain and set aside. Note: The pasta sauce takes about 30 minutes to make, so try to time it so that you drain the pasta right as its time to throw it in the sauce.

2020-12-23,22,"Hot Pot (Part 1): How my parents shop for meat and produce!","madewithlau","For awhile now, I've been meaning to get all of my parents' tips on how they buy the freshest meat and veggies. We recently went on a grocery run to Costco and 99 Ranch Market and I filmed the whole thing and took a bunch of notes to share. 

This specific post is the 1st part of our 3 part series on **hot pot**, so a lot of the items we buy are tailored for that - BUT there are a lot of great general tips for buying all sorts of meat and vegetables. 

I'll be sharing the other two sections in the next two weeks :)

Part 1 - Our shopping list and how to buy meats/veggies for Hot Pot  
Part 2 - Knife fundamentals, how to prepare meats  
Part 3 - Our recipes for homemade fish balls, sauces, and our simple soup base

Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNYWJNvDbJk&amp;&amp;list=PLvd5bo3J-_kq4FcYVCOK6ZR87dCGDqrSH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s) to follow along on our grocery haul!

# What is Hot Pot?

If you've never heard of hot pot, the name is fairly descriptive. It's a meal where you cook your meats and vegetables as you go in a pot of flavored soup (usually on a portable hot plate. The 6th image in this post's carousel has an image of what our hot pot looks like.)

Its a really low stress way to have a fun and festive meal with people you love. On this particular weekend, we were celebrating my birthday, but hot pot needs no excuses to be enjoyed on any day of the year. 

# Shopping List for Hot Pot

Serves \~10-12 people

* 2 lb beef flank
* 1 lb chicken breast
* 1 lb pork chop
* 2 lb tilapia fish fillets
* 1.5 lb shrimp (31/35)
* 1.5 lb squid
* 1 lb firm tofu
* 4 oz vermicelli noodles
* 1 lb Chinese broccoli
* 0.5 lb seafood mushroom
* 0.5 lb king oyster mushroom
* 1.5 lb daikon

I'll be sharing more details on how to cut, prep, and create sauces and our soup base in the next 2 weeks.

# My parents' criteria for buying meat

* For all types of meat - try to find meat that has less (or none) water pooling around in the packaging. This is a sign that it's not as fresh.
* For whole fish - look at the eyes. If they're black, it's fresher. If it's white, it's older.
* For shrimp, squid - There's not much to differentiate other than size. For hot pot, my parents prefer 31/35 shrimp and smaller squid.
* For red meat - they look for cuts of meat that have less fat, white. I think this is mainly for their health, since some people prefer more fatty cuts.
* On pre-sliced meats for hot pot - you can save A LOT of money if you cut it yourself. We'll be going over this next week!

# Food labels for beef

When shopping for beef, if available and affordable, you might consider these two labels: **Certified Organic**, and **Grass Fed, Grass Finished**.

* The **USDA Certified Organic** label applies to a lot of different foods and drinks, but for beef, it refers to cattle that eat entirely organic feed, have access to a pasture, and are never administered antibiotics or hormones.
* **Grass Fed, Grass Finished**, also known as **100% Grass Fed**, means that the cattle ate grass for the entire duration of its life. The Grass Fed label by itself can refer to cows that started on a grass fed diet, but were fed grain in the last few months of their lives in order to help them quickly gain weight.

# Food labels for all farm animals

* Amongst the strongest seals of approvals is the **Animal Welfare Certified** label from the Global Animal Partnership, a non profit originally created by Whole Foods Market in 2008.
   * This is one of only 3 food certification labels endorsed by the ASPCA, one of the oldest and largest humane societies in the world, the others being **Certified Humane** and **Animal Welfare Approved**. Although theyre not as widespread, they set much higher standards than the more common USDA Organic certifications.
   * If you live in the US and feel inclined to support these causes, you can look for GAP certified meat at Whole Foods, or through Butcher Box, a popular meat delivery subscription service that sources their meats in line with all of the highest standards that weve touched on.

# Buying fish from sustainable sources

Its important to at least be aware of how we can support sustainable methods and sources of fish.

While it might not always be feasible to shop in this way, as consumers, an easy way to do our part is by making sure we vote with our wallets.

Monterey Bay Aquarium in California runs a free website called Seafood Watch which has a ton of recommendations on how to choose and purchase seafood in ways that have the least environmental impact.

\------

# Our why

I've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.

1 cup milk

1/2 tbsp vanilla

3 egg yolks

1/3 cup sugar

1/8 cup cornstarch

1/2 tbsp unsalted butter

1/4 cup chocolate chips

1 and 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream

Instructions

Add the milk to a medium saucepan, place over medium heat and bring to a boil.

In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk until smooth.

Whisk the hot milk gradually into the egg mixture until incorporated.

Pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened. You know it is done when you can run a wooden spoon along the bottom of the saucepan, and it leaves a clean line.

Remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate chips and butter until melted. Let cool slightly. 

Cover with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming.

Chill about an hour.

Once chilled, whip up the heavy cream until thick and you can overturn the bowl without any cream falling out. Remember not to over-whip.

Fold the whipped into the chocolate pastry cream.

Brownie Layer

2 cups semisweet chopped chocolate or chocolate chips

1/2 cup butter

1/2 cup light brown sugar

4 large eggs

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1/4 teaspoon salt

1 cup all purpose flour

Instructions

Preheat oven to 325°F. Line a 9×9 baking dish with parchment, and grease with oil. Set aside.

In a medium saucepan, cook butter over medium heat until melted and browned, stirring constantly. It should take about 4 minutes. You will see it change color and aroma with brown bits forming at the bottom. Immediately take it off the heat and pour over the chocolate chips.

Let the mixture sit to allow the chocolate chips to melt and then stir until no more chunks of chocolate remain. Whisk in the brown sugar.

Next add the eggs and whisk until evenly combined. Next mix in the vanilla until smooth. Stir in the salt and flour until theyre evenly incorporated. Then pour the batter into the prepared pan.

Bake the brownies for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Let the brownies cool completely and cut or crumble into bite-sized pieces.

Whipped Cream Layer

1 and 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream

Instructions

Whip up the heavy cream until thick and you can overturn the bowl without any cream falling out. Remember not to over-whip.

Assembly

In each glass, place alternating layers of brownie bits, chocolate diplomat cream, and whipped cream. Garnish with shaved chocolate on top.",2643

2020-12-21,11,"Tried grinding peanuts to make peanut butter but instead got this. How do I fix this?","ziburinis","You probably didn't grind it long enough.  Toasting the peanuts first helps to release the oils too.  So toast them a bit, then while warm put them in the food processor or blender and pulse it until they are chopped. Take some out now if you want chunky pb. Grind a minute, scrape again.  It will start to clump up.  Keep going.  The next minute, scrape sides again, then do it again.  After about 3 mins of grinding it should start to look smooth and a bit glossy.  Add your salt, extra oil if you want it,honey, spices.  Then grind another min or two and it should be much smoother, keep going until it's as smooth as you want/can get it.  It won't ever be as smooth as commercial but should be pretty good.  I think it needs a total of 5-6 minutes of grinding to get it soft and spreadable.",794
2020-12-21,31,"[Monday] What are your recipe questions?","macneil88","I found a recipe that I was interested in making but was slightly confused with the following step:

&gt;2.  Whilst potatoes are on, put red split lentils into a small  saucepan over medium heat with 500ml of vegetable stock and splash of  white wine. Add carrots, onion and celery and add to a large saucepan  with  butter and garlic. Cook until soft. Add tomato puree. Turn heat  down to a simmer whilst you mash the potatoes with your desired amount  of butter and plenty of pepper. 

I get the first part; red lentils in saucepan with veg stock and white wine but the next sentance explains to ""Add carrots, onion and celery and add to a large saucepan"". My interpretation of this is that the the carrots, onion and celery are added to the saucepan that has the red lentils, stock and wine, and then immediately transferred to a large saucepan.. but I don't think I am understanding correctly, otherwise why not have just added the preceding ingredients straight to the large saucepan with butter and garlic. Also there is no mention of time, surely you'd want to wait a minute or two for the flavours to fuse. I think there is too much going on in those instructions for one step.

Does anyone have any advice as to how best to follow this :)",1247

2020-12-20,13,"Hong Kong Bakery Style Tuna Buns","_adventurousbaker_","Tuna buns are a staple of Hong Kong bakeries that are a personal childhood favourite.  These buns are soft and pillowy with just a touch of sweetness that complements the savoury tuna filling.  Enjoy!

Full video recipe [here](https://youtu.be/W9SZk0NjbS4)

**Ingredients** **(makes 8 buns)**

Dough

* 15g bread flour (for tangzhong)
* 75g whole milk (for tangzhong)
* 350g bread flour
* 45g sugar
* 2 tsp yeast
* 1 tsp salt
* 175g whole milk
* 1 large egg
* 45g butter, softened and cut into cubes

Tuna filling

* 2 cans tuna (\~160g)
* 1/4 white onion, diced
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp white pepper
* 1 1/2 tbsp Japanese mayo

Egg for egg washOptional roasted black sesame seeds for topping

**Directions**

1. Make the tangzhong. Cook 15g bread flour and 75 whole milk over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture forms a thick paste. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
2. Combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add in the cooled tangzhong, milk and egg and mix until everything comes together into a rough dough
3. Start kneading the dough  it will be very sticky at first so its recommended you do this in the bowl. Gradually add in the butter cubes as you knead. Once the butter is fully incorporated and the dough starts to become smooth and less sticky (it will still feel tacky), transfer onto a lightly floured surface.
4. Continue to knead the dough for about another 20 minutes. Dont exert too much force or push the dough down as you knead  instead pull the edge of the dough farthest from you out and fold back in, then give it a quarter turn and repeats. This helps to prevent the dough from sticking to the kneading surface without having to add excess flour.
5. The dough is done once the surface becomes very smooth and it passes the window pane test. Cut a small piece of dough and stretch it out gently between your finger. When you hold it up the light, it should be translucent. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover and let rise for about an hour, until doubled in size.
6. Meanwhile, prepare the tuna filling. Drain the water from the tuna and mix with the onion, salt, white pepper and mayo until everything is well incorporated and the filling is creamy. Add more mayo if the filling is too dry. You can also adjust the seasoning here to taste.
7. Once the dough is risen, transfer it onto a lightly floured surface and gently deflate it. Divide into eight balls of around 60g each.
8. Flatten each ball and form into a circle by rotating the dough with one hand and rolling back and forth over the edges with a rolling with the other hand. Try to make the centre slightly thicker than the edges as this will help prevent filling from leaking out when you seal and form the bun.
9. Add around 1 tbsp of filling to each bun and seal it off by pinching the edges toward the centre, rotating the bun in your hand as you go. Place the bun, sealed side down, onto a floured surface and gently shape it with your hands to create a rounded look.
10. Cover the buns and let rise for around 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350F.
11. Brush the tops of the buns evenly with a light layer of egg wash and sprinkle the tops with roasted sesame seeds if desired. Bake at 350F for 20  25 minutes.
12. Let cool until the tops of the buns are soft before serving.",3337

Video with clearer explanations: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZwixnpSUfI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZwixnpSUfI)

**Ingredients**:

For the pumpkin spice dough:

* 1.5 tbsp pumpkin spice
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* 1/8 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp butter
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 tbsp milk
* 2 tbsp maple syrup
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

For the matcha dough:

* 2 tbsp matcha powder
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* 1/8 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp butter
* 4 tbsp white sugar
* 3 tbsp milk
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

**Instructions**:

1. Combine all the dry ingredients of the pumpkin spice dough.
2. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar for the pumpkin spice dough. Add in the rest of the liquid ingredients.
3. Add the dry mix to the liquid mix slowly while mixing.
4. Wrap the dough in a plastic wrap and chill it in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. You can leave it overnight as well.
5. Repeat steps 1 - 4 for the matcha dough.
6. Cut the pumpkin spice dough in half. Roll out one half of the dough into a 1/2"" thick tube. Cut the tube in half and set aside.
7. Repeat step 6 for the other half of the pumpkin spice dough.
8. Repeat steps 6 - 7 for the matcha dough.
9. Now you should have 4 tubes of the pumpkin spice dough, and 4 tubes of the matcha dough.
10. Interlace one pumpkin spice piece with one matcha piece, and roll them into a circle like shown in the video.
11. Repeat step 10 for the rest.
12. Lay out the dough in a 2x2 formation on a lightly floured surface.
13. Roll out the dough into 1/4"" thickness. You can squeeze together the dough if there are any gaps.
14. Cut out your preferred shape.
15. Bake them at 375 F for 7-10 minutes. 7 minutes is for softer cookies, 10 minutes is for crispier cookies. I go for around 8 minutes for a chewy center and crispy exterior.
16. Let them cool and enjoy!",2177

Ingredients:

\- 500g flour 

\- 1 tsp of yeast 

\- 1 tbsp of sugar 

\- 300g of ground pork 

\- 1 tsp of grated garlic 

\- 1 tbsp of soy sauce 

\- 2 tsp of oyster sauce 

\- 1/2 tsp of salt 

\- 1 tsp of sugar 

\- 1 tsp of dark soy sauce 

\- 1/2 cup of green onion 

\- Drizzle of sesame oil 

\- 1/3 cup of chicken stock, unflavored

&amp;#x200B;

Directions:

\- Add 1 tsp of yeast into 250g of warm water. Stir and make sure yeast is fully dissolved. 

\- In separate bowl add 500g of all purpose flour, 1 tbsp of sugar. Give it a quick mix. 

\- Pour yeast water in batches, stir flour with chopsticks until it looks like kind of stringy, like weird pasta.  

\- Start kneading the flour until it combines with itself and forms a dough. 

\- Cover dough and let it sit for 1 hr and 45 min.  While dough is sitting, make the filling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Combine the following: 

\- 300g of ground pork 

\- 1 tsp of grated garlic 

\- 1 tbsp of soy sauce 

\- 2 tsp of oyster sauce 

\- 1/2 tsp of salt 

\- 1 tsp of sugar 

\- 1 tsp of dark soy sauce 

\- 1/2 cup of green onion 

\- Drizzle of sesame oil 

\- 1/3 cup of chicken stock, unflavored  

Stir everything for 2-3 minutes, then set filling in fridge.  

After the dough has sat, it should be about 1.8-2x bigger. Cut the dough open and it should look like spiderwebs, or many threads. This means there's air in the dough. We need to get the air out.   

\- Sprinkle some flour on the counter to prevent sticking. Start kneading the dough now. Press forward and down with your palm and fold back. Repeat this. You can cut the dough into smaller pieces to help you knead faster. 

\- Check the dough by cutting the dough and seeing the cross section for bubbles. if there are too many bubbles, combine dough and keep kneading. 

\- Cut the dough into equal sized pieces. Each piece of dough afterwards should be enough for one bao zi. 

\- Take one piece of dough with your left hand, and use your thumb to hold the center in place. Use your right hand pinch the edges of the dough (not the center where your thumb is). - Put in some filling at the center of the piece of dough, and fold. Left thumb and middle finger go under the wrapper. Keep pinching folds of wrapper together, using your right thumb, index, and middle finger to create folds. Your left thumb never leaves the first fold, so the subsequent folds are folding onto that first fold. As you're folding, your left hand is turning the wrapper clockwise to facilitate motion.  

\- Repeat the above however many times you need.  

\- Prep your steamer. Put parchment paper in steamer to prevent sticking (if you're using paper, cut holes in the paper to allow steam through!). You can also brush your steamer with oil.

\- Put buns into the steamer, then bring the water to a boil. Steam for 15 minutes.  - After it is done, leave the steamer covered for 3 minutes.

INGREDIENTS FOR ABOUT 12 PANZEROTTI

* 180 gr Milk
* 180 gr water
* 40 gr extra virgin olive oil
* 10 gr dry yeast
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 300 gr all purpose flour
* 200 gr semolina flour
* 400 gr mozzarella
* 400 gr tomato sauce
* 40 gr grated parmigiano
* 1 clove of garlic
* Salt
* Black Pepper

INSTRUCTION

* In the stand mix put 180 gr milk , 180 gr water, 40 gr extra virgin olive oil, 10 gr dry yeast, a teaspoon of sugar, 8 gr salt and mix well
* add 300 gr all-purpose flour and 200 gr semolina flour and work the dough until is well firm and elastic.
* If you don't have a stand mix you can work the ingredients with your hands starting from the flours and yeast and adding the liquids a little at the time
* let the dough rise for 2 hours covered with a cloth
* After 2 hours from the dough make smaller balls ( about 70 gr each ) and let them rise for another hour
* Meanwhile cut 400 gr mozzarella in slices and arrange them gradually on a tray lined with absorbent paper and cover with other sheets of paper towels. Press gently to remove the excess water.
* take the mozzarella and cube it
* in a pan put a spoon of extra virgin olive oil and a clove of garlic, when the garlic is well browned add 400 gr tomato sauce, salt and black pepper.
* Cook for about 20 minutes and let it cool a bit
* Now in a mixing bowl put the mozzarella dice, the tomato sauce and 40 gr grated parmigiano and mix well
* On a floured pastry board work the balls of dough with a rolling pin making a small round shape (a mini pizza to be clear )
* Place the filling in the middle ( a couple of spoon but depends on the dimension of the panzerotto ) and fold over each panzerotto to form a half-moon shape
* Press the dough to seal it well and cut the excess of dough
* in a large pot pour an abundant quantity of oil and heat to the right temperature. You can check it by sticking a wooden skewer in the oil. If bubbles form around the skewer, it is time to add the panzerotti.
* Turn the heat down slightly. Don't fry too many panzerotti at a time otherwise the oil temperature will drop and the panzerotti will soak too much oil becoming less digestible.
* During frying turn them a couple of times to obtain a uniform browning.
* The panzerotti will be ready in a couple of minutes, eat while are still hot!!

2020-12-17,6,"cheese pizza on homemade crust","gingerspice1","Pizza Crust Recipe 

Ingredients 

-2 tsp + 1/4 tsp active dry yeast

-1 tbsp granulated sugar 

-1 1/2 cups warm water

-1 tsp salt 

-2 tbsp olive oil 

-3 cups of all purpose flour 

-1 tbsp corn meal

Directions

-  In a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or in a large bowl with a rubber spatula, add yeast, sugar, and warm water. Stir mixture. Wait 5 to 10 minutes for the yeast to bloom. The yeast is blooming once you start to see a beige froth forming. This step is vital to the recipe. If the yeast does not bloom that means it is dead and the dough will not rise. So make sure the yeast is alive and blooming! 

-After the yeast is done blooming add salt and half of the olive oil (if you are using extra spices, add it here). 

-Next, add in half the flour and stir. If you are using a stand mixer, start off slow and work your way to a medium speed to avoid flour going everywhere. 

-Add in the last half of flour. The dough should start releasing from the sides of the bowl and it should start forming a ball. If it is not doing that, add a 1/2 cup of flour at a time until it releases from the sides of the bowl and is not sticky. 

-Once the dough is formed, add the remaining olive oil to the bowl and coat the dough in the oil. 

-Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise for 1 hour.

-While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. 

-Place the pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven so that it can heat up. This is another important step that will help the dough form a solid crust on the bottom! 

-Once the dough is done rising, retrieve the preheated pizza stone/baking sheet. Sprinkle corn meal on the pizza stone/baking sheet. This will help the dough not to stick to the stone/sheet. 

-Next place the dough on the stone/sheet and start to shape it into a circle or whatever shape you want. Work from the middle and push the dough outward. 

-Once you have the dough the way you want it. Place your toppings on and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until your cheese is nice a bubbly and the crust is golden brown.

Key Notes:

Hot Pot Items are all as needed and you can choose whatever you want. I suggest a good assortment of root vegetables, vegetables, sliced meats, fish balls, fish cakes, rice cakes, tofu, pork liver and intestines.

Make sure you watch the video if you're interested in the techniques used to prepare some of these items.

I always cook some items in the pots of broth PRIOR to transferring to a hot pot, as this will allow you to have a full pot ready to eat, instead of waiting for everything to heat up at the dinner table. Throw in the root vegetables, let that cook for 10-15 min then throw in an assortment of tofu, fish cakes. Don't pre-cook any meats as these cook very fast.",3947

### INGREDIENTS 

* 2-1/2 lbs beef chuck shoulder, cut into 1 cubes
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 6 oz bacon, cut into 1"" squares (1-1/2 c)
* 1 Tbsp vegetable oil
* 1-1/2 c carrots, cut into 1"" pieces
* 1-1/2 c yellow onions or shallots, roughly chopped
* 2 c dry red wine like Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot
* 2 Tbsp flour
* 2 c beef stock or bouillon
* 2 Tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tsp dried thyme or a couple fresh sprigs
* 2 bay leaves (remove before serving)
* 10 pearl onions (optional, but nice addition)

#### Mushrooms

* 10 oz cremini (button) mushrooms, quartered or halved, depending on size
* 2 Tbsp butter (or more as necessary)
* 2 Tbsp garlic, minced
* Olive oil as needed
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Additional Ingredients

* 4 Tbsp flat leaf Italian parsley, chopped
* 1 lb egg noodles

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Heat 1 Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium heat.
* Add the bacon (it should sizzle). Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. 
* Add beef cubes (make sure they sizzle when touching the oil) and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Make sure not to overcrowd the pan. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
* Add carrots and onion (or shallots) and stir for about 3 minutes. Season with 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper.
* Add the cooked bacon and browned beef cubes, add 2 Tbsp flour, give it a really good stir, and cook for 2 minutes. 
* Add 2 cups red wine, 2 cups beef stock, 2 Tbsp tomato paste, thyme, bay leaves, and pearl onions. Bring to a boil. Stir and reduce to a simmer. Now, its time to put the lid on. 
* Stir every 15 minutes or so to make sure youve got a good simmer going and nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan. 
* After about 1-1/2 hours, it should be ready, or close to it. Now is a good time to taste. Dont sweat it if it still seems a little strong on the wine taste. Itll mellow. But make sure it doesnt need any more kosher salt. 
* Now that the beef bourguignon is almost ready, were going to sauté the mushrooms. In a large frying pan over medium heat, melt 2 Tbsp butter until it slightly bubbles and foams. 
* Add minced garlic for just 30 seconds (you want them fragrant but not burned) and add the mushrooms. 
* Stir, add a little olive oil (or more butter) if you think the mushrooms are too dry). Season with a pinch of kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes.
* Add the sautéed mushroom-garlic-butter mixture to the Dutch oven and give it one more last stir.
* Serve over your favorite side dish. In my case, thats buttered extra-wide egg noodles.
* Sprinkle with chopped parsley and pour everyone a nice glass of red wine. ",2981

Also known as gaai láan in Cantonese, this is a super easy recipe that I ate almost every single week growing up. Even for a simple dinner, my dad would have at least 3 or 4 courses, and Chinese broccoli was (and is) always in the rotation as his go-to vegetable dish for us kiddos.

We'll also be going over:

* How to pick the freshest Chinese Broccoli
* How to store gai lan at home
* How to get the perfect, soft, crunchy texture for gai lan
* Dietary alternatives to oyster sauce

Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi3FB2NtLCc&amp;&amp;list=PLvd5bo3J-_kq4FcYVCOK6ZR87dCGDqrSH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s) for a walkthrough.

## THE RECIPE

Overview

* Prep Time: 3 min
* Total Time: 10 min
* Yield: 4 servings

Ingredients

* 1 lb **chinese broccoli**
* 8 cups **boiling water**
* 1 tbsp **oyster sauce**
* 1 tbsp **olive oil**

# Step 1 - Guide to Gai Lan: An Overview

* Here's a brief overview of what we'll be doing and how to get the perfect texture:
* Boil an abundance of water
* Add olive oil and salt to the water
* Bring the water to a boil BEFORE adding the gai lan
* Bring to a boil again, and cook the Chinese broccoli for 1 to 2 minutes

# Step 2 - Wash gai lan, heat wok, boil water

As always, my dad says to thoroughly wash our veggies.

We'll turn our stove on to its highest heat and set the wok on top of it. Start boiling **water** (8 cups) - the amount doesn't have to be exact, but more is better.

The less time we spend cooking Chinese broccoli, the better. And one key way to achieve a faster cooking time is to use a larger volume of boiling water.

Chinese restaurants are able to cook gai lan incredibly quickly, because they use larger woks on more powerful stoves.

# Step 3 - Add olive oil, salt

Next, well add **olive oil** (1 tbsp) and **salt** to the water.

In my dad's words, this is almost like ""make up"" for the Chinese broccoli, and it helps the gai lan retain a fresh green color and adds a beautiful shimmer.

# Step 4 - Wait for boil, add gai lan, cover

It is critical that our water starts boiling before we add the Chinese broccoli. We want to keep the cook time as short as possible.

Since every piece of gai lan is uniquely shaped, if you notice that there are pieces of gai lan that have a thicker stem, we can take a knife and cut down the middle of the stem about 1-2 inches.

This helps increase the stem's cooking surface area and helps it cook faster, and also helps all of the different sized pieces of gai lan cook evenly.

Once the water is boiling, add the gai lan, and cover the wok. If they're not fully submerged, add more hot/boiling water.

# Step 5 - Bring to a boil, cook for 1-2 minutes

In total, once the wok comes to a boil again, we'll only need to cook our gai lan for 1 to 2 minutes.

As the wok starts to come to a boil, about halfway there, you can flip the gai lan.

More on why we want to cook Chinese broccoli as soon as possible:

* The less time that the gai lan is sitting in the boiling water, the less nutrients it loses, and the less chlorophyll it loses.
* It's not only healthier, but it will look more mouthwatering when we're done.

# Step 6 - Uncover wok, taste

Once 1 to 2 minutes are up, uncover the wok. Cut off a piece of stem and chew on it.

If it's crunchy to your liking, you're done! If you'd prefer it to be softer, you can cook it for another 1-3 minutes.

# Step 7 - Make final touches

Once you're happy with the texture, turn off the heat and transfer the gai lan to a plate.

Take scissors and make 1 to 2 cuts along the stems and leaves to make the gai lan easier to eat.

Then, we'll drizzle some **oyster sauce** (1 tbsp) and more olive oil to taste.

Call your loved ones over - time to eat!

# How to select fresh Chinese Broccoli

My parents get into a lot of detail in our video's Meal Time section, but we're looking for a few cues:

* The stem should be a light, fresh color
* The stem should easily snap in half
* The leaves should be a deeper green
* The flowers buds, if any, should be green (not yellow)

# How to store Chinese Broccoli

When you get home from the store, line some trays with paper towels and lay each piece across the trays for 4-5 hours.Poke a few holes in a plastic bag, loosely wrap the paper towels around the gai lan, and place them in the bag.Store the bag in a vegetable compartment if you have one.

# Alternatives to Oyster Sauce

If you're vegetarian or need to stay away from gluten, we have three alternatives for you!

**Vegetarian Oyster Sauce**

Since oyster sauce is made out of oyster extract, here are some alternatives that have a similar taste without using the actual oyster:

* Wan Ja Shan Vegetarian Mushroom Oyster Sauce
* Lee Kum Kee Vegetarian Stir Fry Sauce

**Gluten Free Oyster Sauce**

Wok Mei has a gluten-free oyster sauce, but it still contains oyster extract, so it's not vegetarian friendly.

**Vegetarian + Gluten Free Oyster Sauce**

Unfortunately, we don't know of a vendor that sells an oyster sauce that caters to both dietary restrictions, so you'll need to DIY the sauce.

Mix equal parts gluten free soy sauce and gluten free hoisin sauce. This isn't exactly the same as oyster sauce, but it's pretty close.

\-------

# Our why

I've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.

Thanks for reading! Hope you all love the recipe :)",5659

=÷=÷

Serves 4

**Ingredients for the dumplings:**

* 1kg (2.2 Pounds) of peeled potatoes (use variety with a high starch content like for chips or roasted potatoes)
* 250g (8.8oz) of potato starch or cornflour
* 13g (0.46oz) of salt
* 1-2 eggs (depending on the moisture of the dough)
* 1tbsp of butter for coating once cooked

**Ingredients for the Beef stroganoff:**

* 600g (1.3 Pounds) of diced beef (leaner cuts will be ready in 3 hours, ones with more connective tissue may require 6 hours of slow-cooking)
* 2 small onions diced
* 4 garlic cloves slightly crushed
* 800ml (0.84quarts) of beef stock
* 1 large carrot diced (120g (4.2oz))
* 2 bay leaves
* 3 allspice berries
* 300g (10.6oz) of white mushrooms cut in quarters
* 100ml (0.1quarts) of double cream
* 1tbsp of yoghurt/thick sour cream (optional)
* 10g (0.35oz) of dill
* 1tsp sugar
* salt and black pepper to liking
* 10 baby gherkins
* rapeseeds oil
* 1tbsp plain flour
* 1,5tbsp butter

**Instructions for the sauce:**

**1.** Heat the frying pan to moderate heat with a little bit of oil and sear of the diced beef in **2-3 batches** to improve its flavour. When done transfer to the medium-sized pot or slow-cooker.

**2.** Use the same frying pan to sweat the onions and garlic, add **2tbsp of oil** and reduce the heat to medium. After **5 minutes** transfer to the master pot.

**3.** Add **800ml** of beef stock, allspice and bay leaves then bring to a boil and reduce to simmer, when using slow-cooker set it on high (I used a leaner cut that was ready in **3 hours**, others may need up to **6 hours**). In the meantime jump to dumplings.

**4.** When the meat is almost ready, add diced carrots and continue cooking for another **30 minutes**.

**5.** Once the meat is tender, saute diced mushrooms to brown all around and season with salt when almost ready, add to the master pot along with the cream.

**6.** Use the same frying pan to melt **1,5tbsp** of butter then add **1tbsp** of plain flour, once combined, cook on medium heat for around a minute then stir into the master pot to thicken the sauce.

**7.** Finish the sauce by adding fresh chopped dill and **1tbsp** of yoghurt, balance the flavour by adding **1tsp** of sugar and salt and black pepper to your liking.

**Instructions for the dumplings:**

=÷=÷

**1.** Begin by boiling potatoes in salty water until ready for mashing.

**2.** Mash potatoes until smooth, I recommend using a potato ricer as this has a direct impact on the texture of your dumplings.

**3.** Place potatoes on two plates to cool-down until lukewarm, cover them to prevent moisture evaporation.

**4.** After **30min - 1hours** potatoes should be ready to work with, place them together in a bowl and add **250g** of potato flour/starch and **2** eggs. Mix together with a spoon and transfer to the worktop to continue kneading by hand.

**5.** Once the dough is combined divide it into two parts and roll each part on the surface with hands into the size of a rolling pin **(5cm diameter (2inch)**.

**6.** Slice the logs to equal rings **1,5cm (0,6inch)** in thickness. Roll each piece in hands to a ball shape then make a dip with your knuckle. Place each dumpling on a cloth ready for boiling.

**7.** To boil dumplings use a pot of slightly salty water, once you add them in, give it a stir and wait until they float to the top, from that moment begin the count to **3-4 minutes** and remove them from the water on to a plate, add butter to coat and serve with the sauce garnished with fresh dill and gherkins.

=÷=÷

**Insight:**

* Adding egg to Silesian dumplings depends on the variety of potatoes used, their dryness and temperature of the mashed potatoes. Some recipes don't use it at all.
* Beef Stroganoff originated in Russia and spread quickly throughout the world, bringing additional ingredients like mushrooms, mustard or tomatoes.
* In Poland, gherkins are served with the dish or added to it in the last stages of cooking.

**Ingredients**

* 6 eggs, 5 of which you'll turn into scotch eggs
* a small bunch of coriander
* curry sauce
* 625g of minced lamb
* homemade curry spice blend (the steps to making it are below)
* nutmeg
* 20g of ginger
* 1 orange - I used a yuzu, but oranges will be fine - make sure it's organic though
* smoked salt, although that is optional
* frying oil
* flour (for breading)
* breadcrumbs (for breading)
* pickled daikon (slice the daikon, radish, onion or vegetable of choice thinly, then mix it with half vinegar - half water, a pinch of salt, sugar, turmeric, star anise and coriander seeds, that you bring to a boil, then chill)
* salt and pepper

&amp;#x200B;

**For the curry spice blend**

Dry roast, in a small pan, on the stove, until the spices start releasing their flavour:

* 1/2 tsp Cumin seeds
* 1 tsp fennel seeds
* 1/2 tsp Cardamom seeds
* 1/2 tsp Fenugreek seeds
* 1 star anise
* 2 tsp Coriander seeds
* 1 tsp Black pepper
* 1/2 tsp Cloves
* 1 Ceylon cinnamon stick

Then grind them finely, ideally in a mortar and pestle, together with the dried rose petals.

* 1 tsp dried rose petals

Finally, mix then with the following:

* 1 tsp sweet paprika
* 1/2 tsp chilli powder
* 2 tsp turmeric powder

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps**

1. Start by chopping the coriander finely. Add it to the minced lamb.
2. Back to the meat: grate the ginger, add two teaspoons of the curry blend, grate some nutmeg, add the smoked salt, then grate the zest of the whole orange, sprinkle some pepper and mix well. Put to the side until you cook the eggs.
3. Bring some water to a boil, then cook your 5 eggs for 6 and a half minutes, not longer, then put them under cold running water or an ice bath. Otherwise they will continue cooking and you won't end up with a runny yolk!
4. Crack the eggs and peel them - leaving them in water once slightly cracked makes peeling easier.
5. Heat the oil in a pot or pan. You'll need enough oil to cover a bit more than half of the egg.
6. Crack the 6th egg - you'll use that for the breading. Mix with a spoon, season with salt and pepper.
7. Get the flour and breadcrumbs next to you and start shaping the scotch eggs. You can either spread the meat in a thin layer on your palm, or spread it onto cling film and wrap the egg around it.
8. Make sure the egg is properly and evenly wrapped, or else it might crack when frying, which may overcook the egg and well, that won't look very nice!
9. Get the eggs breaded - first flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs.
10. Once the oil is hot, add the eggs and fry them for exactly 5 minutes, turning them in the process. If they turn brown too quickly, turn down the heat. And you can test the sizzle with a little bit of breadcrumbs.
11. Heat the curry sauce in the meantime, and add the juice from half of the orange to it.
12. You can probably see how stressed I was not to overcook that egg! But it worked! And I tested this not once, not twice, but three times.
13. Look, it's brown, crunchy and beautiful. Time to plate up!
14. To plate up, add the curry sauce to a bowl, place the egg, then with a teaspoon, add a little curry sauce to get the pickled daikon to stick. I used some fennel fronds as garnishes, felt the need for some green on the plate. You can also grate a bit of citrus zest, like I did.",3461

2. Put on cling wrap and put into microwave. Mine is 600W for 1min. Take it out and mix. Repeat this step 3 times. While its still hot, add ingredients (B)

3. Put the wrap onto the custard cream and let it cool before putting in the fridge

4. Now we make the tart base. Into a microwavable bowl, add the butter and without using wrap, microwave for 20seconds. Add sugar and mix till it looks like mayo. Add the flour and milk and mix gently till smooth. Then, put cling wrap over it and put in the fridge for about 10 min

5. On a frying pan (should be at least 20cm), add the tart base mix. Knead it to desired circular tart base shape. On low heat for 20min, then if the base gets hard turn over for another 10min

6. Once done, leave the tart for an hour in the frying pan for it to cool and become tart-like. If not cooled, you will get a soft and crumbly base

7. Spread the custard cream on top of the tart base and leave a bit of space around the edges and add your toppings. Mix ingredients (C) and dress it over the toppings. Or you could brush it properly on top of the toppings.",1740

2020-12-14,30,"[Monday] What are your recipe questions?","Eucalyptus_Squid","I used go work there years ago, and I can still remember exactly how this sandwich is made! This [recipe](https://www.food.com/recipe/schlotzskys-original-sandwich-79137) is virtually identical to how we made it. A few differences to note:

1) In the store, we didnt use marinated olives. It was literally just a giant can of sliced black olives that we drained and put on the line. 

2) The olives were placed on the bottom bun and covered with the cheese prior to melting.

3) Finely shred your cheese. The recipe doesnt really specify this. 

4) Dont deep fry your bread. The bread has always been baked. In fact, it steams in the oven when its baked in store. 

Let me know how it goes if you try it out!

Edit: forgot to add that we used red onions and not white like the recipe states. I cant believe I forgot that one considering I often sliced the onions when prepping. It made me permanently hate red onions lmao.",927

* once the butter is well melted put it in the savoiardi's crumbs, add 50 gr ( 1.76 ounce ) of coffee too and mix well
* Press  the mixture into the bottom of an 20 cm (8 inch) springform pan, you  can put a cake collar in it now. Chill in fridge until firm, normally 40  minutes.

\----------- How to Mascarpone  Cream  ---------------

* separate the egg yolks from the egg whites
* put the gelatin in abundant water for at least 10 minutes until is soft
* in  a mixing bowl put the yolk and begin to work it with an electric whisk  if you are not sure of the freshness and quality of the eggs you can  always pasteurize the eggs ( see\*)
* add 1/2 of sugar at the time and let the yolks absorb it
* work the yolks until they change color
* add the mascarpone a little at the time beating with an electric whisk until it becomes smooth.
* Repeat the operation with the cream cheese
* put  the heavy cream in a saucepan, warm it on low heat and put the gelatin  well drained from the water. Mix until the gelatin is well melted in the  heavy cream
* Add the heavy cream at the mixture a little at the time and continue to beat until the batter is creamy and smooth

\------------ Assembly-------------------------

* Cut the remaining savoiardi in half
* take the springform pan from the fridge and pour half of the cream cheese mixture
* Soak  the savoiardi in the cold coffee for a few moments and distributed it  on the cream pressing gently until you obtain a layer  pour another  quarter of the cream.
* can  happen that the savoiardi will rise a little, don't panic. Put the cake  in the fridge  for 20 minutes then press a little the savoiardi in the  cream.
* Finally cover with the remaining cream cheese mixture  put the springform pan in fridge for at least 3 hour.
* take off the cake collar and using a strainer dust the cheesecake with a dense layer of unsweetened cocoa powder.

That's  all!  if you have any question feel free to ask.  See you next time, i  think that will be a classic carbonara!  In the meanwhile Buon  Appetito!!!

\*To pasteurize egg  yolks. Whip them with 65 gr sugar while you prepare the syrup with  another 65 gr sugar and 45 gr of water. Wait for the syrup to reach 120°  C. ( 248°F), then pour it very slowly over the whipped yolks, mixing  the syrup well with the yolks if you have a stand mixer and a food  thermometer the operation it's pretty easy

200 gr all purpose flour
150 gr room temperature butter
20 gr powdered sugar
1 egg yolk
1/2 tsp salt
1 shot espresso

For the tiramisu cream:

5 eggs
100 gr granulated sugar
500 gr mascarpone cheese
0.7 dcl wine liquor (prosecco)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt

To garnish

cocoa


..........

METHOD
For the tart crust:

1)
Place your softened butter into a mixing bowl, add sifted sugar and mix well with a spatula, until creamy.

2)
Now add your yolk and continue mixing.

3)
Now add your espresso and mix to incorporate. (Once you mix in your espresso the buttery mix will seem to have separated, but just give it a good beating for a minute and it will come back together.)

4)
once all your wet ingredients are beautifully blended, add your sifted flour and salt.

5)
Work the dough with your hands as least as possible until roughly formed a dough (Do not kneed!)

6)
Press your dough down with your hands into a disc, cover with cling film and refrigerate for an hour.

For the ""ladyfingers sponge""

1)
While our dough is resting, we will prepare this simple sponge.

pre heat the oven to 170*C and separate yolks and whites. In a mixing bowl place your egg yolks along with 30gr sugar and beat well with a mixer until very thick, light yellow and creamy. (this will take somewhere between 5-10 minutes) best way to check is to dip your finger into the cream. If you dont feel any sugar youre good to go.

2)
Now add vanilla extract and mix well shortly until incorporated.

3)
In a separate bowl, mix egg whites, along with a small pinch of salt on medium speed until you get soft peaks. (2-3 minutes). Once soft peaks are present, turn the speed to high adding the rest of you sugar (30gr) gradually. Mix until you get sharp spikes and a glossy firm texture. (Or flip the bowl over your head and check if it falls&.on your head.)

4)
Now sift the flour over the egg yolks mixture then add salt and 1/3 of your egg whites meringue.

5)
Fold in your flour and meringue with a spatula gently going all the way from the bottom to the top as flour tends to fall down.

6)
Once incorporated, add the rest of your meringue and keep gently folding.

7)
Once all the ingredients are well combined, transfer to a baking tray aligned with parchment paper. (I drizzled a bit of oil under the parchment paper to help it stick.)

8)
Now using a offset spatula, distribute the mixture evenly around the surface making sure its not more than 0.5cm thick.

9)
Place inside your preheated oven on 170*C and bake for about 15 minutes or until beautifully golden brown.

10)
Once done, turn the oven off and leave it inside for another half an hour or so. If the oven seems too hot, or if the dough has already got a rather darker color, open the oven door slightly to let some of the heat out.

11)
Once done, while still warm cut out the sponge to your desired shape to fit your tart mold.

Back to tart crust:

1)
Place your chilled tart dough in between two sheets of parchment paper and flour lightly.

2)
Gently roll out the dough. Apply no greater pressure than the rolling pin itself. Applying pressure while rolling tart crust will cause it to break, so just be patient.

3)
So basically the easiest way to make a round shape is to pass the rolling pin back and forth until it doubles in length, then rotate the dough 45* and repeat this step.

4)
Roll the dough until very thin (about 5 mm), and feel free to lightly dust as needed while rolling. Also make sure the diameter of the dough is about 6 cm wider than the diameter of the mold. (the recipe works for up to 28 cm molds)

5)
Now align your baking mold with parchment paper and grease the edges with butter.

6)
Tuck in the edges of the mold, but very gently, as pressing hard would make the dough think around the edges and collapse the tart.

7)
Place the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes (or even better into a freezer) to let the dough set and pre heat the oven to 175*C.

8)
Take out of the fridge and poke the dough with a fork. This is crucial so the dough doesnt bubble up from escaping steam while baking.

9)
Now to blind bake the tart pastry, cover the whole dough with parchment paper, its important to cover the edges as well, as they would burn off very quickly.

10)
Now fill the dish with baking beans, rice, beans, lentils or what ever you have in your pantry.

11)
Place inside your pre heated oven on 175*C for 20 minutes. Once done let cool off 15-20 minutes with the beans still in place, then remove beans and let cool completely.

To make the tiramisu cream.

1)
Separate egg yolks from egg whites. Place your yolks in a heatproof bowl, along with sugar, and wine liquor.

2)
Place the bowl over bain-marie on medium heat and whisk constantly until thick and creamy. (it will take in between 5-10 minutes.)

3)
Once beautifully creamy and bright yellow, remove from the heat and add mascarpone (preferably room temp.) to your egg mixture, along with vanilla and a small pinch of salt.

4)
Beat well with a whisk until incorporated. At first youre going to think, no, this will never come together I need a mixer, and 30 seconds later it will come together.

5)
If your mascarpone cheese wasnt room temp like mine, youll need to pass the cream through a fine sieve to remove lumps.

6)
Now beat your egg whites along with a small pinch of salt until you get sharp peaks and a glossy thick texture. (You dont really need the salt when making meringue, salt or acid just helps it stay together.)

7)
Once your meringue is beautifully thick and glossy, add half of it to your mascarpone cream and fold in slowly and carefully.

8)
Once all is incorporated, add the second half and fold again.

To build your tart:

1)
Take your crust, and fill the bottom with tiramisu cream and spread out evenly using a silicone or offset spatula.

2)
Now mix together two shots of espresso and wine liquor. Very quickly dip the ladyfinger sponge into the mixture on both sides and place over the cream. (Less is definitely more when soaking ladyfingers in coffee! leaving them any longer than two seconds will make them fall apart and make your tiramisu watery as they will absorb too much liquid.)

3)
Now fill the tart with cream to the top and even it out with an offset spatula.

4)
decorate per wish with more cream and sift over fresh cocoa.",6636

The quantity are for a baking dish 22 x 31 cm servings for 8/10, well in my family is more for 6/7 but we love lasagna!

Ingredients Servings for 8/10

* Salt
* Black Pepper
* Grated Parmigiano

Bolognese sauce:

* 500 gr minced beef
* 250 gr minced pork
* 1 celery ribs
* 1 onion
* 1 carrot
* 120 gr extra virgin olive oil
* 130 gr tomato paste

* 1 glass red wine

Bechamel Sauce

* 100 gr butter
* 100 gr all purpose flour
* 1 liter milk nutmeg

Homemade Lasagna sheet

* 200 gr all purpose flour
* 200 gr semolina flour
* 4 eggs
* 28 gr extra virgin olive oil

Lasagna have several separate preparation so let's begin with the longest one, ragu bolognese

* chop finely 1 celery ribs, 1 onion, 1 carrot in a large size pot put the vegetables and 120 gr extra virgin olive oil
* when the vegetables are browned add 500 gr minced beef and 250 gr minced pork when the meat is well browned and the liquid is a bit evaporated add 1 glass of red wine and let it fade
* add 130 gr tomato paste and mix well after that add 500 ml water
* cover with a lid and cook at medium/low heat for 2 hours and half stirring occasionally

meanwhile we can prepare homemade lasagne or bought it at the grocery

* Put all-purpose flour and semolina flour on a pastry board in equal amount ( for example 150 gr all purpose and 150 gr semolina flour ), making a hole in the center where we will put 1 whole eggs every 100 gr flours and 7 gr extra virgin olive oil every 100 gr flours
* With a fork we amalgamate the eggs and let the flour be incorporated
* salt the dough and continue this operation until it will be possible to work it by hand.
* work the dough until it is smooth and even.
* Leave it to rest in a film in the fridge for 30 minutes at least.

Now let's prepare béchamel sauce

* in a medium size pot put 100 gr butter and let it melt
* add 100 gr all purpose flour and mix well Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.
* Slowly add 1 liter milk, one ladle at a time whisking constantly, until mixture is smooth.
* Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, for 10 to 12 minutes or until sauce comes to thickens
* Add a pinch of nutmeg and salt and let the bechamel sauce cool

For homemade lasagna

* work the dough with a rolling pin and divide in several part now with the help of a pasta machine begin to lower the thickness of the dough
* the dough will be ready when it is one millimetre thick or a little more
* make large rectangles, i usually do 15 x 10 cm

If we use homemade lasagne we don't need to cook them first take a baking dish and let's compose our lasagne

* Put a ladle of ragu, a ladle of bechamel and a handful of parmigiano and mix
* let's cover with the pasta and repeat this operation until the baking dish is full
* i suggest between 6 to 8 layers at max

If instead you want to use bought pasta you should cook the lasagna sheets before you put in the baking dish, even if there is written in the instruction that you can put directly in the baking dish, is better to cook them for 3/4 minutes. In this way you don't have to do a too liquid bechamel

For a baking dish 22 x 31 cm you will need about 450 gr lasagna sheet, 900 gr bolognese sauce and 700 gr bechamel sauce

For a baking dish 22 x 16 cm instead about 300 gr lasagna sheet, 500 gr bolognese and 400 gr bechamel

* Cook the lasagna in oven for 30 minutes at 190° and let it cool a bit before serving

* Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and season for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to prevent the stew from sticking. If the stew reduces too quickly, add a bit more stock or water, as needed.

#### Cook the Risotto:

* First, warm the stock in the microwave or over the stovetop.
* While the stew simmers, prepare the risotto. Melt the butter into the saucepan and add the oil. Turn the heat to medium. Once the butter is melted and frothy, add the shallot and cook for 3-5 minutes until translucent.
* Add the arborio rice and toss to coat with butter. Cook for 2-3 minutes.
* Add the stock, one or two ladlefuls at a time, stirring between additions. Allow the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. Continue adding the stock until the rice has absorbed the liquid and is al dente. Do not overcook the rice.
* Turn the heat off and stir the parmesan cheese into the pot. Allow the rice to rest for 5-10 minutes to settle.

#### Cook the Maitake Mushrooms:

* While the risotto rests, cook the maitake. Melt the butter into a skillet and add oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the maitake mushrooms in an even layer and cook without moving for 2 minutes until the mushrooms turn deep golden brown. Flip and cook an additional 2 minutes until crispy. Turn off the heat and transfer the mushrooms to a small bowl and season with flaky sea salt.

#### Finish the Stew:

* Stir half the maitake mushrooms into the stew and add all but a pinch or two of parsley. Cook for 1-2 minutes more. Turn off the heat.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the risotto between shallow bowls and spoon the risotto on top. Add the reserved crispy maitake on top and garnish with the rest of the parsley and reserved fennel fronds. Enjoy!

2020-12-09,116,"Fondue For Two","PotatoLurking","Hey OP! I tried your recipe and it was HEAVENLY. I actually wasn't born lactose intolerant and used to love cheese so eating cheese again was such a treat 

I halved the recipe to be kinder to my stomach. After rubbing the garlic I didn't know what to do with the rest of the clove. Since I love garlic I just decided to turn it into a paste using a mortar and pestle. I tossed the paste in with the white wine and cornstarch. I know very little about types of cheese, but from your lists I used a mix of munster and mozzarella since they were on sale. I forgot to Google what an alpine cheese was before I went to the store.. my fondue ended up a lot thicker than your photo so I may have made a mistake.

I took two lactaid pills, hoped for the best, and dug in. It was fantastic!! I normally dont like any wine flavor. I've also tried those cheese boards where you eat cheese and wine? But didn't enjoy the wine. Maybe this means I like wine after it's been cooked off then. I finally understand why people like wine and cheese together!

In the end I had minimal stomach pain. Totally worth it. Thanks again OP!! I love following this subreddit because I always want to experience different foods I've never tried before. Thank you for making my fondue dreams possible!!",1274
2020-12-09,4,"Crispy Chicken with Stewed Mushrooms","BushyEyes","If you don't have the hot peppers and 'maters, use a can of tomatoes (crushed, diced, whole-peeled, whatever you like), a cup of roasted red bell peppers, and a lot of crushed red pepper instead. You also might be able to find a variation of jarred hot peppers and tomatoes at your grocery store that would be an okay substitute too!

There's really not much to this recipe, honestly, it's just one of my favorite quick weeknight meals that can be modified endlessly. Try it with pork chops or hot Italian sausage links. you can also do skinless chicken thighs or even chicken breasts, if you want to reduce calories.

Serve it over rice, buttered noodles or potatoes, mashed cauliflower, or with sautéed veggies.

* Wide pot

**Ingredients**

* 2 teaspoons oil
* 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs

* Salt and pepper to taste
* Cooked white rice for serving, optional

**Instructions**

**Cook the Chicken:**

* Preheat oven to 425ºF. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Place in the pot, skin-side down, and cook for 5-6 minutes or until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Flip and cook 1-2 minutes more. Transfer to a plate.

**Cook the Onion:**

* Add the onion to the pot and cook for 4-5 minutes until softened.

**Cook the Mushrooms:**

* Melt the butter into the pot. Once melted and frothy, add the mushrooms and cook for 10-15 minutes until the mushrooms release their liquid and the liquid evaporates and the mushrooms turn deep golden brown. Season with salt, pepper, and dry thyme and toss to coat.

**Simmer the Stewed Mushrooms:**

**Bake the Chicken:**

* Arrange the chicken on top of the mushrooms and transfer to the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165ºF. If desired, turn on the broiler for the last two minutes to crisp up the skin again.

**Cook the Rice:**

* While the chicken bakes, cook the rice according to package instructions or prepare your favorite side dish, such as buttered noodles, boiled potatoes, or sautéed green beans.

**To Serve:**

* Remove the chicken from the oven and sprinkle with parsley. If serving with rice, spoon the mushrooms over the rice and place the chicken on top. Garnish with a touch more parsley. Enjoy!

2020-12-08,5,"A Very Good Common Cake, from A New Method of Domestic Cookery C. 1824. I really enjoy this cake. I usually make a buttercream with rose water and lemon zest to go on it. It's a nice lemony cake. The first day or so it's fairly soft, then it becomes more crumbly kind of like a large coffee cake.","ripper914","Here's the recipe written a bit more modernly.

Ingredients:

One Packet Dry Yeast

1/2lb Butter

2lbs Flour (Preferably Cake Flour)

Water

4 Eggs

1lb Sugar

1pt Milk

6oz Sherry

Zest of one Lemon

1tsp Ground Ginger

1lb Currants, or some Caraway Seeds (optional)

DIRECTIONS

Preheat over to 350F

Dissolve one packet of yeast into a small amount of warm water, let it sit while you complete the following steps.  Cream half a pound of butter, mix into it two pounds of (cake) flour.

Add the yeast, then add enough water to form a thick dough, cover,  and let it rise for an hour and a half.

Beat four egg whites to stiff peaks, and the four yolks separately.

Mix the four egg yolks, one pound of sugar, and a bit less than pint of milk into the risen dough.

Add a glass of Sherry (probably 5-6 ounces or so if your making the full recipe.)  Mix it in.

Add the zest of one lemon and a teaspoon of ground ginger.

Beat this mixture well to ensure that everything is nice and smooth, then fold in the egg whites.  You can add Currants at this time as well, although I never do.

Butter and flour a cake pan, cast the batter into it and bake at 350F until a clean broomstraw can be thrust into the center and removed without residue, or any other testing method indicates doneness.  I can't say I've timed it, and since I usually halve the recipe, it wouldn't be an accurate time anyhow.

Enjoy!

For the frosting:

Cream one stick of softened butter, mix into it enough powdered sugar that it becomes thick.  Slowly add a small amount of milk until it becomes a buttercream.  Add a dash of rose water, and whatever zest you can get from the lemon you used for the cake.",1691

2020-12-05,78,"Microwave Panna Cotta","NorkyTheOrky","I love to flavor my panna cottas with brown sugar and with chai spices (whole black peppercorns, ginger, whole anise, some allspice, a couple sticks of cinnamon, and some others I'm sure I have forgotten at the moment). I usually add a touch of vanilla as well. It's not a traditional flavor profile, but it's a family favorite. You just steep the spices on the stove after bringing the cream just to a simmer. Reheat the cream after 10-20 minutes just enough to melt the bloomed gelatin. Then strain, cool, pour into serving dishes or molds, and refrigerate until set. 

Depending on how much gelatin you use, it can either be a softly-set egg-free pudding, or a firmer jello-like consistency but made with milk. I believe the traditional flavor is vanilla, but I have even used eggnog instead of cream. Feel free to get creative, and the internet has some great flavor combos, especially when you start to pair the panna cottas with sauces, poached fruits, cookies, and other toppings or additions.

 I am going to have to try this microwave recipe straight away though. In the past I've only made much larger portions made on the stovetop for holidays to serve guests, but this is perfect for smaller servings during Covid.",1226

# METHOD

* Preheat the oven to 400F / 200C/ 180C fan.
* Remove the leaves and stalk from the cauliflower. Chop the cauliflower florets into chunks.
* Peel the carrots and pumpkin and chop into 2cm chunks.
* Add the cauliflower, carrots, and pumpkin to a nonstick baking tray and toss with 1 tbsp of oil and a good pinch of salt. Roast in the oven for about 30 minutes until soft and golden. Stir a couple of times during cooking.
* Heat the remaining 1 tbsp of oil on medium/ low heat. Add the onion and ginger and sauté for about 3 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and spices and cook for a further 30 seconds.
* Add the tomatoes, coconut and cashew milk, coconut aminos, and season. Bring to the boil and then simmer on medium/ low heat for 20 minutes uncovered or until it thickens.

This sponge cake soaked in 3 delicious milks, is my one of my favorite holiday desserts. It's so moist and creamy. Perfect with some coffee or tea. 

Here's the video tutorial: https://youtu.be/PI-_B8A_DCk

TRES LECHES
- 1 1/2 cups cake flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 cup sugar
- 5 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

TRES LECHES GLAZE
- 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
- 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 cup half-and-half

WHIPPED TOPPING
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

INSTRUCTIONS
Pre-heat oven to 350ºF. Whisk together the cake flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium mixing bowl and set aside. In another bowl, mix butter and sugar and until creamy. Add the eggs one at a time and mix to thoroughly combine. Next, add vanilla extract. 

Once the wet batter is complete, add the dry ingredients to the batter in 3 batches and mix just until well combined. Spread the batter evenly in a greased and floured baking dish. It will appear to be a very small amount of batter. Don't worry, batter will expand.

Bake for 20- 25 minutes until lightly golden. Remove from oven and cool for 30 minutes. In the meantime, poke holes in the cooled cake and begin to prepare the tres leches glaze. Whisk together the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and half-and-half. Pour mixture over the cake and allow it to soak overnight or for a more than 3 hours. 

While it soaks, make the topping. Pour cream, sugar, and vanilla in the bowl and whisk on low speed for 3 minutes. Gradually increase speed until cream is thickening. Whisk until cream forms soft peaks. Spread whipped topping over the cake and cool for 30 more minutes.

2020-12-04,30,"Creamy Kabocha Pasta","TheGrumpyGarbanzo","# [Creamy Kabocha Pasta](http://grumpygarbanzo.com/Meals/Creamy%20Kabocha%20Pasta/)

A kabocha squash makes an excellent door stop. It's hefty enough to prop your door firmly open while allowing the world to view your superb taste in squash. I know this because I bought a kabocha squash on a whim, ignored it for a week, and demoted it from food to doorstop for another week because I was too intimidated to attempt Thai curry at home.

But you know what's less intimidating than curry? Pasta.

This recipe boils down to a few steps (see what I did there?): roasting kabocha squash and removing the peel, caramelizing an onion, blending and seasoning the sauce, cooking pasta, and baking the squash skin to create a crunchy and pretentious topping. I seasoned my peels with smoked paprika for bacon vibes. You can blend the squash skinandall, but the sauce may turn an unpleasant color due to the dark peel mixing with the bright orange flesh. I hesitate to give exact measurements for the sauce because everyone has different taste preferences; just add small amounts of seasonings at a time, taste test, and stop messing with it when you've made a delicious sauce or are too tired to care anymore.

# What:

1 kabocha squash

1 yellow onion

garlic

non-dairy milk

orecchiette pasta

olive oil

seasonings:

* nutritional yeast
* tomato paste
* apple cider vinegar and/or sour kraut juice
* vegan chicken broth paste
* soy sauce
* chili paste or flakes
* smoked paprika
* salt &amp; pepper

# How:

Pasta:

* Cook orecchiette according to package. Reserve some pasta water (about 1/3 cup) for the sauce.

Blend the sauce:

* Remove baked squash from the oven and let it cool enough that you can handle it without burning yourself.
* Use a spoon to scoop the flesh of the squash from the skins and into a blender.
* Add enough oat milk to allow the squash to blend into a paste. Make the sauce thicker than you would like, because it will be thinned by additional liquid ingredients.
* Blend in the caramelized onions.
* Now comes the experimentational part of the recipe: seasoning the sauce. This should be done to taste, but I'll explain what the ingredients do for the sauce and give rough estimations of the quantities I used. Melted vegan butter or oil (1.5 tbsp) will create a rich, creamy base. Our umami friends: tomato paste (1.5 tbsp), vegan chicken broth paste (1 tsp), and soy sauce (1 tbsp); add these a little at a time. Nutritional yeast (23 tbsp) will provide that almostcheesy flavor. Apple cider vinegar or sour kraut juice will give you a muchneeded tang to balance out the richness; add a little at a time. I think you know what chilis, salt, and pepper do. Use pasta water to thin the sauce to your final desired consistency.

Crispy topping:

* Toss or spritz the squash skins with oil. Salt and pepper to taste.
* Bake at 450ºF until crispy.
* Sprinkle with smoked paprika for a baconish flavor.

Assemble:

* Mix pasta with sauce over heat and top with crispy squash skins.

# What did I use and why?

Oat milk: I find that it is the creamiest of vegan milks.

Better than Bouillon No Chicken Base: Because this is a paste, it's ideal for adding a bit at a time without diluting the sauce.

Trader Joe's Italian Bomba Hot Pepper Sauce: I'm obsessed with this paste made from Calabrian chilis. It's fermented, but not funky, and a nice alternative to Sriracha.

It's the same story with samosas. Sure, we can appreciate the crispy, deepfried goodness that normally surrounds a samosa. But are fullblown homemade samosas really feasible on an average weeknight? Unless you were taught by your grandma and know a wonton wrapper recipe by heart, probably not.

So, I present to you: the samosa bowl. This deconstructed samosa includes the key elements of potatoes, peas, and spices. Added chickpeas and rice boost the protein content and make the meal more filling. The lack of a fried wrapper makes the meal healthier and less dangerous; sharp, triangular foods are simply up to no good. Enjoy the flavors of a samosa from the comfort of your spoon.

1. Peel and smash the garlic cloves. Gently fry them in olive oil (medium low heat) until slightly golden and fragrant. 
2. Add the spinach and cook for a few minutes until it wilts down. Add the frozen peas. Add the mint leaves. You can start with just a few and then adjust later, depending on how strong the soup ends up tasting.

* 1 pound of rigatoni or ziti
* 1 pound ground sweet Italian sausage
* 1/2 pound 85% lean ground beef
* 24 ounces marinara
* 15 ounces ricotta cheese, transferred to a bowl and stirred to soften
* 8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into bite-sized cubes
* 1/3 + 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese, divided
* 67 chopped fresh basil leaves
* salt and pepper, to taste

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 425 °F.
2. Bring a large pot of water with a pinch of salt to a boil. Cook pasta al dente, strain, and transfer to a bowl or back into the boiling pot once its cooled. Stir in 1/3 cup parmesan cheese and 1 1/2 cups marinara. Mix and set aside.
3. Meanwhile, bring oil in a large pan or skillet to medium heat. Cook sausage and beef until browned and fully cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Use the tip of your spatula to break the sausage and beef into small chunks. Season with salt and pepper, to taste and set aside.
4. Take half of the pasta and layer filling the entire bottom of a 13X9 casserole dish. Layer with half of the beef and sausage mix, and then half of the ricotta cheese. Spread the ricotta with a rubber spatula, doing your best to spread thinly and evenly. It will tend to stick. Its best to work in small dollops and spread as best you can. **It does not need to be perfect!**
5. Repeat step 4 with the remaining ingredients. Pasta, sausage/beef, then ricotta.
6. Layer top with 1 cup of marinara. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes uncovered. Remove from the oven, top with a layer of 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and all the fresh mozzarella. Bake for 20-25 additional minutes or until cheese is fully melted and starting to turn golden. Sometimes a 2-minute broil at the very end will help deliver a perfect golden singe.
7. Let cool for 10 minutes, top with basil, and serve cut in squares

* Line a muffin pan with greased muffin liners or use silicone muffin molds.
* Mix all the dry ingredients together in a bowl.
* Whisk, using an electric whisk, the brine from a carton of chickpeas to make the aquafaba, until light and fluffy. I like to use chickpeas just in water. Youll need 6 whipped tbsp for this recipe. Discard the rest.
* Add the wet ingredients (coconut oil, almond milk, maple syrup, and aquafaba) to the dry and stir to combine.
* Spoon the mix into the muffin cases, about 3/4 of the way to the top, and bake in the oven for about 15 - 18 minutes or until you can insert and remove a toothpick without any crumbs sticking. Allow to cool and remove from the silicone cases.
* Mix all the coconut yogurt frosting ingredients together in a bowl until fully combined. Spoon into a piping bag and pipe onto the cooled cupcakes.
* Depending on what brand of coconut yogurt you use will vary how thick the frosting is. I like Coyo as its quite thick. Thinner coconut yogurts may require just spooning as opposed to piping. Option to put the frosting in the fridge for 10 minutes to help set before piping if you need to.",1595

1. Combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl starting with the water and sugar first. Whisk to combine. Set aside. Sauce can be made ahead and stored in the fridge.
2. Thinly slice flank steak into 1/4 inch thick strips **against** the grain. **This part is very important for tenderness. Cut strips into 2-inch bite-sized pieces.**
3. Cook rice according to the directions on the package.
4. Meanwhile, bring skillet to medium heat. Add 1/2 cup water and broccoli. Cook broccoli, tossing occasionally until just starting to tenderize, about 5 minutes. The water helps steam the broccoli and prevents burning. If the water evaporates, add a splash more. Broccoli should not be raw but still a little snappy.
5. Transfer broccoli to a bowl and add oil to the skillet. Add steak in a single layer and season liberally with pepper. Cook for about 1-2 minutes per side or until no longer pink.
6. Add sauce to the skillet and bring to a simmer. As soon as it bubbles, reduce heat to low and let thicken, about 1-2 minutes. Add broccoli and toss with the steak until everything is coated. if sauce gets too thick add a little warm water. Top with green onion and sesame seeds. Serve over white rice.

**Ingredients**

* About 200g of parsnip
* 20g of butter
* 3 tangerines
* Two egg yolks
* Szechuan pepper
* A round piece of puff pastry, about 20cm in diameter, chilled in the fridge for about an hour
* Whipping cream
* salt
* dried camomile - you can use a small camomile tea bag, as long as it's fresh and good quality
* 2tbsp of sugar

**Steps**

1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees.
2. Start by peeling the parsnip. Then, chop it in 2 centimetre slices. I used a cake tin to make sure it all fits in a circle that's just slightly smaller than the puff pastry.
3. Squeeze two tangerines. You'll use them to cook the parsnip.
4. Melt the butter in a pan.
5. Add half of the sugar (1tbsp) and stir for a few seconds.
6. Add the slices of parsnip to the pan, in that nice circle you built earlier.
7. Pour the tangerine juice.
8. Sprinkle a nice spoonful of szechuan pepper and some salt.
9. Cook them on medium to low heat, covered, until the parsnip is tender and until there is barely any tangerine juice left in the pan (that took about 6-7 minutes in my case).
10. Remove the lid, then baste the parsnip in the caramel until the tangerine juice has evaporated and you're only left with a thick caramel - as yellow as saffron.
11. Take the parsnips off the heat, chill them (I did that outside since it's cold now anyway).
12. Add the puff pastry on top, making sure there is a little of it coating the sides too.
13. Bake for about 15 minutes, until the caramel has turned brown but not black, and until the puff pastry is nice and golden.
14. Bring some water to a slow simmer, in a pot. This will be your bain marie, in which you will make the tangerine custard that will go into the whipping cream.
15. Squeeze the last tangerine.
16. Add the yolks to a bain marie pot.
17. Season, add the remaining sugar and whisk until the egg and tangerine custard has thickened to the consistency of a hollandaise.
18. Whip the cream, then gently fold in the egg and tangerine custard. Ideally, with a spatula, in circular movements, from the bottom to the top.
19. Take out the tarte tatin and turn it upside down on a flat surface.
20. Now time to plate! Add the tarte tatin to a plate - if you don't want it to move around when you transport the plate, add a little of the cream onto the plate and place the tart on top. Adding the cream onto the hot tart will make it melt, so I recommend doing that when you serve the dish, at the table. Then, sprinkle a bit of dried chamomile, ideally by passing it through a small and fine mesh strainer to remove the stems.",2745

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta until al dente. **Reserve 2 cups of pasta water before draining and set aside.**
2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter with olive oil. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for about 4 minutes or until very tender. Do not burn!
3. Add tomato paste, red pepper flakes, and vodka. Stir until paste fully coats the shallots and garlic. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Add **1 cup** of pasta water. Stir until smooth. Bring sauce to a simmer, add cream, and turn off the heat. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Fold in the pasta until fully coated in the sauce. Add parmesan cheese and continue to toss/mix.

6. Serve garnished with more Parmesan and chopped fresh basil.

2020-11-30,8,"Seared Duck Breast with Lingonberry Sauce","BushyEyes","This perfectly seared duck breast with lingonberry sauce is a simple and beautiful meal.

### Equipment

* Skillet
* Sauce pan
* Large pot
* Colander
* Hand mixer

### Ingredients

#### Ricotta Mashed Potatoes:

* 1½ pounds Yukon gold potatoes peeled and quartered
* ½ cup ricotta cheese
* ½ cup whole milk plus more, as necessary
* 2 tablespoons butter
* ½ teaspoon nutmeg plus more as desired
* ½ teaspoon white pepper
* Salt to taste

#### Duck Breasts:

* 2 Moulard magret duck breasts skin scored and breasts seasoned all over with salt and pepper
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Lingonberry Sauce:

* 2 teaspoons reserved duck fat
* 3 tablespoons butter divided
* 1 shallot peeled and minced
* ½ cup lingonberry jam
* 1 lemon juiced
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* ¼ cup water

#### For Serving:

* 1 shallot peeled and thinly sliced into rounds
* 4 ounces arugula
* Salt and pepper

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Potatoes:

* Cover the diced Yukon gold potatoes with water and add salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 25 minutes until very soft. Drain into a colander and transfer to a large bowl.
* Add the ricotta, milk, butter, nutmeg, and white pepper to the bowl and use a hand mixer or potato masher to blend until smooth and creamy. If desired, add a few splashes more of milk until desired consistency is reached. Taste and season with salt. Add more nutmeg or white pepper to taste, as desired. Keep the potatoes warm as you prepare the rest of the meal.

#### Start the Duck:

* Place the duck breasts, skin-side down, in a skillet (ensuring that there is enough room for both of them without them touching each other). Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for 10-15 minutes until the skin is very deep, golden brown and the fat has rendered out. As you cook the duck skin, use a spoon to remove some of the duck fat and transfer to a heat-proof bowl.
* Flip the duck breasts and cook an additional 7-10 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 140ºF when inserted at the thickest part of the duck breast. Transfer to a wooden cutting board and cover with foil. Rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

#### Prepare the Lingonberry Sauce:

* While the duck is cooking, prepare the lingonberry sauce. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and two teaspoons of the reserved duck fat in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 2-3 minutes until softened.
* Add the lingonberry jam, lemon juice, ¼ water, and sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes until thickened. Once thickened and reduced, turn off the heat. Mount the butter into the sauce and stir until emulsified and glossy. Set aside.

#### Cook the Arugula:

* Immediately after the lingonberry sauce is cooked, prepare the arugula. Remove all but a tablespoon or two of duck fat from the skillet and transfer to the heatproof bowl.
* Turn the skillet to medium heat and add the sliced shallot. Cook for 2 minutes until softened.
* Add the arugula and cook for 3-4 minutes until mostly wilted. Turn off the heat and allow the residual heat to cook the arugula the rest of the way. Season with salt and pepper.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the mashed potatoes between shallow bowls. Pile the arugula on top and arrange the sliced duck breast on top. Spoon the lingonberry sauce on top. If you like, sprinkle a touch of nutmeg on top of the mashed potatoes and garnish with just a hint of flaky sea salt on top of the lingonberry sauce. Enjoy!

You can just eyeball things, correct? I would think the only difficult part would be the dressing which you seem to have a solution for.

Judging by the picture, it looks like they are using a single romaine stalk chopped into bits. Probably a 4-6 oz chicken breast. Tomatoes and shredded cheeses you can eyeball, and I doubt they use more than half of an avocado in a salad because avocado is expensive. Bacon is probably just a single slice of bacon chopped into strips or bits.",609

I would have opted to add flour after sautéing the butter, onion and garlic to make a roux that would then thicken the addition of broth, then added the cream after that for final thickening. 
-OR- I would have made a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken the broth mixture at the end.
-OR- I would have tossed the cheese with cornstarch, but typically that only works when the cheese is a bit more wet than Parmesan (like a cheddar, Gouda, etc).

But it seems you arent using any of those methods. Are you adding cornstarch directly to the sauce? If so, how do you avoid lumps? Does cornstarch thicken well this way if not used in a slurry?",708

All you really need to do is make ""chili flakes"" with dehydrated red bell peppers, and swap them in for the chili flakes in your favorite chili oil recipe. You can buy these online, but dehydrating them yourself yields a MUCH more vibrant red oil (see the second photo in my post).

**Oven Dehydrated Bell Peppers**

* Cut Bell Peppers into 1/4-1/2 inch squares (see my video).
* Spread out into an even layer on a parchment lined baking sheet (preferably on a wire rack to increase airflow. Just be sure to poke some small holes in the parchment with a toothpick).
* Set oven or toaster oven to the keep warm setting, or as low as your oven can go (ideally the temperature shouldn't go above 150°F (93°C). If your oven doesn't have a low enough setting, you can prop the door open a crack using a wine cork or some aluminum foil.
* Dehydrate for 5-7 hours or until completely dried out, flipping the pieces occasionally.
* Food process peppers into flakes, BUT MAKE SURE YOU DONT MAKE A POWDER.

Oftentimes when people think of Vietnamese food, they immediately think of pho or banh mi. Welp, Vietnamese people eat FAR more than just pho or banh mi, and at home, food is oftentimes far simpler and humbler, like this simple preparation of Vietnamese garlicky roast chicken. 

  
Roast chicken has thousands of iterations across cultures, but this is one of my absolute favorites, and its sooo simple: its got just six ingredients plus the chicken, and after 30 minutes roasting in the oven, youve got a lip-smackingly luscious bird that will beg to have its juices sopped up with some rice!

  
To watch my video on how to make this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90)  
**Viet Garlicky Roast Chicken Recipe (adapted from Andrea Nguyen)** 

  
1 whole 3.5-4 lb chicken, preferably organic and air-chilled, spatchcocked (back bone removed with bird splayed flat), OR 3.5-4 lb chicken parts (thighs, drumsticks, and wings) 

  
*Marinade ingredients:*

* 4 whole garlic cloves, minced finely 
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1.5 tsp sugar
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* 1.5 Tbsp neutral oil
* 3.5 Tbsp Maggi seasoning 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Combine all sauce ingredients into a bowl and mix well. 
2. Prepare the chicken: take the chicken (or chicken parts), and using a chopstick or skewer, carefully separate the skin from the meat all over. Then, add the marinade sauce all over the chicken with your hands, making sure to get the sauce between the meat and the skin. 
3. Refrigerate the chicken and allow to marinade for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor penetration. 
4. The next day, preheat oven to 500 F. Place spatchcocked chicken on a cast iron roasting pan or roasting tray. Place chicken in the oven and roast for about 30 minutes, checking about 5-10 min in to ensure the chicken isnt browning too quickly. If it is, tent the darker parts with foil and lower heat to 450 F. If using parts, roast time may be closer to 40-45 min. 
5. After about 30 minutes, remove chicken from the oven. Check doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer - thighs should register about 165 F when done. 
6. Once the chicken is done, allow to rest for 15 min to ensure optimal juiciness level. Then, cut and serve with rice and enjoy. ",2348

I love these filled cannelloni because you can basically fill them with way more different things and get a great and delicious dinner.
I prefer them with cheese so...

Ingredients:

 - Cannelloni (I had 19 or 20 pieces)
 - 600gr white cheese
 - 200-300gr gouda/edam cheese
 - 150gr creamcheese with onions(or your preferred one)
 - 800ml-1L tomato juice/sauce

Procedure 

 - Is as simple as it gets. Just mix the cheeses together and fill your cannelloni with it
You can either put the use the simple tomato juice as it is, or pre-pare it before hand for a better result.
To prepare it before hand, put it in a pan, and get it to a simmer/boil. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar to balance that acidity
or a spoon depends on how much you gonna use, add some paprika, smoked paprika, basil, oregano, salt, pepper...or just
customize with your favorite spices.

 - Then add a layer of tomato juice, put your cannelloni filled with cheese, cover them with more cheese. You can do a double layer like I did
or just cook 1 single layer. I don't really know if there are different sizes of cannelloni out there so you may have
to adjust the amount of ingredients for yourself.

 - Cover everything with a tin foil and cook into the oven at 180 Celsius for around 20 minutes. Take the foil down
and see if your cannelloni are soft (they should be covered in tomato juice before putting the tin foil).
If they're soft, remove the tin foil, add some cheese on top and cook it for another 5-10 minutes with fan on
until the cheese on top melts or get crispy. And enjoy a warm cheesy meal.

 - You can pre-boil the cannelloni, let them cool a bit and then fill them with cheese. But I think that's more work and harder to fill them.
So do what you think works better for you.

I hope you gonna enjoy them. 

Sometimes I love to precook some chicken, and add it to the cheese mixture. Or add spinach. Play with different kind of cheese and get different taste.
Is really easy to customize this recipe and get something great out of it.",2082

* All-Purpose Flour ( 500 grams )
* Sugar ( 1/2 tsp)
* Yeast ( 5 grams)
* Water (290 gra
* Salt ( 1 Tbl+)
* White Pepper (1 tsp)
* Fragrant Oil ( 2 tbl)
* Scallions ( 4-6 depending on size)

Instructions:

Fragrant Oil- Cut the roots and ends of scallions and finely chop one shallot. Simmer in vegetable oil until golden brown (20 minutes on low heat) then store and use when ready.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Prepare a cup with water, sugar and yeast and let bloom for 10 minutes. Then mix flour and a pinch of salt into a bowl and mix in the water mixture, in increments while stirring. Knead for 7-10 minutes, then coat with oil, cover and let rise for 1.5 - 2 hours.
2. Take dough out and knead for another 3 minutes. Dust the workspace and then create an initial rectangle shape with your hands. Using a rolling pin, roll up and down evenly then rotate horizontally. Roll out each side until you get an even sheet with a decent thickness.
3. Put in salt, white pepper and fragrant oil on the sheet and distribute evenly. Then put on diced scallions and spread all the ingredients equally across the dough. Slowly roll upwards into a spiral shape, carefully and being sure to tuck it in to keep it secure and tight. Should be about 5 full rotations.
4. Stretch out the dough a bit and cut into inch-width pieces. To make the shape: with a chopstick, push down the middle, flip it over and place the chopstick on the bottom using it as a center to rotate around. Rotate the piece all the way until you reach the end. Push down with the chopstick and quickly take it out.
5. Place your Buns in a steamer and let it rise again for another 20-30 minutes prior to cooking. You want to see a size increase and a bouncy dough. Then Steam for 10 minutes.",2089

###**DIRECTIONS**

Step 1) Add 1 tbsp of salt in 3 cups of water &amp; boil cauliflower for 5 minutes on  medium flame for 5 minutes.

Step 2) In a pan, add 1.5 tbsp of oil and fry boiled cauliflower until they get golden spots on them.

Step 3) In the same pan, add another tbsp of oil and flash fry potatoes. Doing this prevents them from breaking when we cook them in gravy. Once they're golden, take them out.

Step 4) In the same pan, add mustard oil and add all the whole spices. Saute them on low flame until they release their aroma.

Step 5) Add green chillies and onions and saute them until onions get golden brown.

Step 6) Further, add Ginger garlic paste and cook it until raw aroma goes away. And 2 tbsp of water and get it all together.

Step 7) Add tomato puree and cook it for 5 minutes on medium low flame. Add salt as well.

Step 8) Add all the dry spices except for garam masala and give them a mix. Cook it covered for 1 minute. This will help the mixture to release oil quickly and cook the spices in it.

Step 9) Add potatoes and cauliflower to it and give a gentle mix. 

**NOTE: If you want the dry version of this curry, just add coriander leaves and garam masala at this point and cook it covered for two minutes.**

Step 10) Add water and give it a mix. Cover it and cook for 15 minutes on low flame or until potatoes get done.

Step 11) Open the lid and add clarified butter, garam masala powder and coriander leaves. Mix it gently so that you don't mash anything. Turn off the flame and keep it covered for 5 minutes. This will help potatoes to thicken up the gravy.

For nutrition information, please visit my recipe page [Turkey Roulade](https://mealvana.io/recipe/turkey-roulade-2/):

## INGREDIENTS

5 pounds skin-on bone-in turkey breast

5 cups Chestnut Stuffing - see my comments above

1/4 teaspoon salt

1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## PREPARATION

Step 1. Carefully remove the skin and save it for later use. Separate either side of the breasts from the bones. Discard the bones. Butterfly each turkey breast and cut it through. You should be able to have four pieces of turkey breast meat at half of the original thickness. Working with one piece of breast at a time, cover with two sheets of plastic wrap, use a meat tenderizer, pound the piece to 1/4 inch thin. Repeat it with other pieces. Season with salt and pepper.

Step 2. On a flat surface, arrange the turkey breast pieces side by side, overlapping the neighboring pieces by about 2 inches with the piece to the left on top of the one to the right. It is very likely the turkey pieces you have are of different shapes. Arrange them so they form a blanket.

Step 3. Place the stuffing in the middle of the blanket, leaving about 1-inch space on the right, 2-inch space on the top, bottom, and left side.

Step 4. Start rolling from the right side. The trick is to roll gently and not to pull the turkey breast piece too tightly while rolling. Cover the log with the turkey skin and tie them properly with a twine.

Step 5. On the day of cooking, preheat the oven to 375°F. Bake for one and a half hour, until the skin start to brown and turn crispy.",1577

1. Wash the turkey, spread the wings out and open up the legs. Take out any interior parts and discard. Remove fat from the skin of butt and neck area. Transfer to a board and dry it very well with some paper towels (inside and out). Separate turkey skin from the meat carefully using hands, being sure to not break the skin. (Just the top side you serve with)
2. Combine spices into room temp butter to make a thick sauce mix. (If too liquid leave in fridge for a little bit) Then rub the butter mixture into the turkey, both inside the skin and outside as well. Tuck the Turkey Wings underneath the body and transfer into a roasting pan.
3. Stuff the cavities of the turkey with our Bao Bei stuffing and then tie up the legs with twine. Place Turkey in a Roast pan. (Pour some extra chicken stock in the pan as well) Cover with foil.
4. Roast at 350° for 3 hours so the thick parts of the turkey get to 155°. Be sure to rotate the turkey at least once, and baste with turkey drippings at least 3 times. Finish the Turkey on a high broil for the perfect color. Take out and Let rest for 30min-1hr

Reserve the drippings inside the pan for Gravy (Be sure you separate the fat out)",2942

Some variations include carrot, and others use more vinegar and sugar but I find this ratio of vinegar to sugar the best since it doesnt result in an overly watery Acar (pronounced Achar like Charmander). Its fantastic on a very warm day. 

**Ingredients** (can be amended to suit your tastes)

* One cucumber. Roughly peel the cucumber so you get that lovely variation in green colour. Score lengthways with a fork. Slice lengthways once through the middle and then chop thinly. 
Realistically you can cut them up however you like but a thin slice is best imo.

* Half a small pineapple, chopped. 

* Half a red onion (or one shallot), sliced as thinly as possible. 

* One red chilli, thinly sliced. Or more if you like spicy stuff.

* Two tablespoons of white vinegar 

* Two teaspoons of white sugar 

* Half a teaspoon of salt 

**Directions**

Chop up ingredients. Mix in bowl thoroughly (very thoroughly) with vinegar, sugar and salt. Dont add any water, there will be quite a bit of liquid from the pineapple and cucumber. Put in fridge for a bit, 30 mins or so. Eat.

Someone asked what this normally goes with. Its usually a side to some white rice and spicy curry. The heat from the curry goes really well with the coolness of the pineapple and cucumber. Otherwise eat it from a bowl like I do.",1399

**Cheesecake:**

* 1 cup (227g) pumpkin puree, from 1kg (2.2lb) pumpkin
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon grated fresh ginger
* ¼ teaspoon grated fresh nutmeg
* 2½ cups (250g) ginger nut biscuit crumbs
* 1 tablespoon (13g) packed light brown sugar
* 6 tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon sea salt, divided
* 24 ounces (680g) cream cheese, softened
* 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
* ¾ cup (178 ml) heavy cream
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs, room temperature

&amp;#x200B;

1. If making pumpkin puree from scratch, slice pumpkin in half, scoop seeds out and place face down on baking pan. Roast in oven pre-heated at 190°C (375°F) for 45 minutes or until soft. Scrape flesh off and blend until smooth.
2. Place pumpkin puree (whether fresh or canned) in saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until the liquid has evaporated (roughly 10 minutes). Add ground cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg to pumpkin puree and mix. Set aside.
3. Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Get a roasting pan larger than the cake pan ready. Line bottom of 9 inch (23cm) springform pan with parchment paper. Cut 3 pieces of heavy-duty kitchen foil and put them in criss- cross on the work surface. Set springform pan in the middle and wrap the edges of the foil around the sides of the pan. This will prevent the water from the water bath seeping in.
4. Crush ginger nut biscuits in a ziploc bag or food processor, and mix with light brown sugar, melted butter and ½ teaspoon salt until crumbs are evenly moistened. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan with the bottom of a measuring cup or glass to make it compact. Bake for 10 minutes until set.
5. In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese and granulated sugar until smooth (2  3 minutes with hand mixer). Add heavy cream, vanilla extract and ½ teaspoon salt.
6. Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing until everything is combined.
7. Add ½ of cream cheese mixture to the spiced pumpkin puree from step #2.
8. Pour remaining plain cream cheese mixture onto the crust. Spoon pumpkin cream cheese mix over the top of plain cream cheese mixture. Place springform pan onto roasting pan.
9. Set the kettle on and pour boiling water onto the roasting pan until it reaches halfway up the sides of the springform pan, being careful that the water does not go above the kitchen foil and not to splash any water onto the cheesecake.
10. Bake for 50  55 minutes, until the centre barely jiggles when you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off, leaving the cheesecake in the oven, and prop the oven door open with a wooden spoon. Let the cheesecake cool for at least an hour.
11. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and from the water bath, and unwrap the foil. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to make sure its not sticking to the sides (which can cause cracks as it cools further). Cover loosely with aluminium foil and chill the cheesecake in the refrigerator overnight.

**Caramel Pecan:**

* ¼ teaspoon sea salt
* Optional spices: 1 stick cinnamon, 1 star anise
* S cup (40g) pecan, chopped roughly

2020-11-21,1,"Pork Chops with Mustard Honey Sauce","zippopwnage","This is my best plate I made yet for sure. I really enjoyed it, and that sauce was amazing. 

So...recipe right?

Ingredients :

 - Pork chops      
 - 1 red bell pepper (to taste)
 - half red onion (to taste)
 - 2tbs Dijon Mustard
 - 1-2tbs honey
 - 1/2 corn starch
 - 1/2 lemon or 1 lime
 - 1 instant noodle soup with pork spices
 - 3-4 garlic cloves
 - some butter

(to taste means that you can put less or more, is not a deal breaker) 

Procedure :

Ok so, in my experience, pork chops without bone are not the most tender meat you can get. But
to make it tender, I personally marinade it for 1-2 hours in orange or pineapple juice, then wash it a little
and then put a dry rub on it, let it sit for 1 hour at room temp and then cook it. Never cook it cold.
With this one I skipped the marinade, but it was ok. 

You should make your noodle soup. I think that's pretty simple to make and don't need any instructions. Just make sure after you're done with it, separate the noodles from the soup.

So, for cooking pork chops. I had a dry rub that had (2tsp white pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, 1tsp of paprika, black pepper and very little nutmeg)
You want some hot oil in a pan (I used vegetable oil), and cook the pork chops for around 3 to 4 minutes on each side depending on their thickness THICC.
I personally love when they get a crust. Don't move them when you put them in the pan. Another thing for making them tender is that when you flip them, cook for 1 minute at the same heat, and then put a lid on and go for low-medium flame.
It will lose some crunch from the curst, but you will get them tender. Another way to cook them is to give them a fast crust on each side, and then put them in the oven. I don't think that's needed tough. Anyway when you flip them, put some butter in
and the cloves of garlic. Remove the garlic when they're done.

After you're done cooking them, put the pan on low flame or off the flame for a few seconds. Throw in your diced bell pepper, let it cook for a few seconds, then throw in your small diced onion. Cook at low flame for around 1 minute or so.
Then the weird part, but trust me, it is REALLY good. Put the noodle soup in, along with the mustard, honey, lemon/lime juice and some of that dry rub spices. Let it simmer/boil a little. You want to reduce it a little but not all the way.
I'd say after it gets to simmer, let it at medium heat for around 1 minute.
At this point mix half of teaspoon of corn starch with a splash of water in another bowl, and then put it in the sauce to make it thicker. I do this because I want more sauce. Reducing too much of it, isn't gonna help me here if I need more.
Mix it and let it simmer for half of minute, and then put the pork chops back for another minute. Sprinkle some cilantro and you're done. Let the pork chop rest for 5 minutes before cutting it.

Put the noodles in a plate, cut the pork chops, put it on top of the noodles, put more sauce and enjoy!

It is simple to make. The problem is that it takes some waiting time. But it was totally worth it!",3068

I should also note I'm using black bean paste that's a bit different than raw chunjang (¥), it's a prepared black bean sauce. So you'll see the colour is not as black as typical jjajangmyeon, but the flavours are basically the same. In the full video you can see which brand of black bean sauce I used for reference.

Hope you enjoy!

Ingredients:

For the noodles:  

* 250g flour  
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/2 cup water  
* 2 tbsp neutral oil  

For the black bean sauce:
  
* 2 large onions (or 3 medium)  
* 4 garlic cloves  
* 1 tbsp cornstarch + 1 tbsp water for the slurry  
* 2 tbsp neutral oil  
* 1/2 lb ground pork  
* 2 tbsp soy sauce  
* 1/2 tbsp sugar  
* 2 tbsp Korean black bean sauce (can substitute with Chinese Tianmian sauce)  

Instructions:  

1. Mix together flour and salt. Add water slowly and mix to hydrate the flour mixture evenly. Mix in neutral oil.  
1. Switch to mixing with hands when dough starts to form. Form a nice ball and set it aside to rest.   Resting will relax the dough, making it easier to work with later.  
1. Dice the onions into big chunks and mince the garlic cloves.  
1. Mix together the cornstarch and water to create a slurry. We'll use this to thicken the black bean sauce.  
1. Over medium heat, add oil and fry up 1/2 lb of ground pork until browned and mostly cooked.  
1. Mix in the minced garlic cloves and the soy sauce.  
1. Add 1/3 of the onions at a time, stir frying in between for about 3 minutes. This will add different layers of texture and sweetness.  
1. Add sugar and the black bean sauce. Stir fry until everything is well coated.  
1. If there is not enough liquid, add 1/4 cup of water. Bring it to a boil and mix in the slurry. Set it aside while we prepare the noodles.  
1. Generously dust your counter space. Roll out the dough as thin as you want your noodles to be. Mine rolled out to around 14"" x 8"".  
1. Very generously dust the top with flour to prevent the dough from sticking when we roll it up.  
1. Roll up the dough, being careful to not press it down.  
1. Before we cut the dough into noodles, dust the knife so the knife doesn't stick to the dough.  
1. Cut the dough into strips, as shown in the video, however thin you want your noodles to be.
1. Loosen up the noodles.  
1. Bring a pot of water to boil. Add the noodles and give it a quick mix so that they don't stick to each other.  
1. Cook for about 3 minutes, until done.  
1. Top the noodles with a generous portion of the black bean sauce and enjoy! It goes really well with some gochugaru (Korean red pepper powder) and kimchi. The black bean sauce goes really well with rice as well.",3006

## Equipment

* Medium pot
* Ovenproof skillet

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon olive oil for frying
* 1 yellow onion peeled and minced
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and finely chopped
* 5 cloves garlic peeled and very thinly sliced or minced
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 2 cups arborio rice
* ¾ cup aji amarillo paste more or less to taste, depending on how spicy it is and your heat tolerance
* ¾ cup dry white wine (or use more stock)
* 5-6 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil for frying
* 5 skin-on chicken thighs
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Parsley, optional, for serving

## Instructions

## Before starting:

* Warm the stock in a microwave or in a small pot on the stove. Turn heat to low and keep warm. Preheat oven to 425ºF.

## Start the Risotto:

* Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 2-3 minutes until it just begins to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook for 12-13 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are golden brown. They should release all their liquid and the liquid should evaporate from the pan. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.

## Cook the Chicken:

* As the mushrooms are cooking, start the chicken. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat neutral cooking oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook without moving for 5 minutes until the skin is very crispy and browned. Flip the chicken and transfer to the oven for 20-25 minutes until completely cooked through. Turn off the oven and keep the chicken in the oven as you finish the risotto to keep it warm.

## Cook the Rice:

* Melt the butter into the pot and add the rice. Cook, stirring regularly, for 2-3 minutes until the rice is coated with butter and begins to turn golden brown.
* Add the aji amarillo paste and toss to coat.
* Pour in the white wine and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low.
* Once the wine has been absorbed, add 1 cup of the stock and stir regularly until absorbed. Continue on, adding a cup of stock, stirring until absorbed and then adding more stock until all of the stock has been incorporated, about 20-25 minutes total. Taste and season to your preferences. Turn off the heat and allow the risotto to rest for 5 minutes before serving.

## To Serve:

* Divide the risotto between shallow bowls and serve with a chicken thigh on top. Garnish with parsley, if desired. Enjoy!

2020-11-20,24,"[Friday] What are you cooking this weekend?","MidnightJ1200","I made something I havent made in a long time: Homemade potato soup. Every time I had some from someone in my family it was good, but I found a recipe that beats them all. I figured out why too: they used instant potatoes. Hell my grandads potato soup is just watery instant mashed potatoes. My potato soup requires 5 lbs. of potatoes, some celery, carrots, onions, garlic, and to start the recipe you cook cut up bacon in the pot and keep the grease. You can use the bacon for a topping later. After cooking it with some other ingredients, you use an immersion blender/potato masher and purée the soup. Add in salt, pepper, and... HOT SAUCE! Yeah, I was taken back by the hot sauce when I first made the recipe, but I always put about 8-10 decent drops into the pot and add a couple more later in my own bowl. Of course, like cooking most spicy things it takes some heat back and incorporates it, so it puts a mild burning in the back of your throat, enough to get your sinuses running. Its delicious and Id be happy to share the recipe",1041

###**Making Chole**:

Step 1) Place all whole spices (except for caraway and fennel) and tea (or dried gooseberry) on a muslin cloth and make a tight pouch. 

Step 2) In a pressure cooker, add overnight soaked Chickpeas, baking soda, salt and spices-tea pouch.

Step 3) Add 2 cups of water and pressure cook it for 3 whistles.

**Note: Baking Soda and Tea neutralize taste of each other and only the black color of tea remains. Baking soda also helps make chickpeas get softer.**

Step 4) Let it depressurize naturally and open the lid. Discard the spices pouch as the spices already released their flavors in water and chickpeas. So save the water for later use.

Step 5) In a pan, add ghee or oil. Let it heat on low flame.

Step 6) Add caraway and fennel seeds.

Step 7) Add green chillies and onions and saute the onions until they get golden brown.

Step 8) Add salt as per taste. Keep in mind that we've also added salt in chickpeas and water.

Step 9) Add ginger garlic paste and cook until raw aroma goes away. Add little water at this stage which will almost melt browned onions.

Step 10) Add all the dry Spices (except for garam masala and Fenugreek leaves.) and roast the spices for two minutes on low flame.

Step 11) Add tomato puree and cook for 2 minutes. Cover it and cook for 5 minutes. Afterwards, tomatoes will be cooked and oil will be released.

Step 12) Now add ginger juliennes and green chillies and add boiled Chickpeas.  Give it a good mix.

Step 13) Add chickpeas water and cover and cook it for 20 minutes on low flame.  

Step 14) After 20 minutes, add garam masala powder, Fenugreek leaves and coriander leaves and give it a mix.

Step 15) Garnish with ginger juliennes, green chillies and onion rings.

###**MAKING POTATO STUFFED BHATURA:**

Step 1) In a bowl, add boiled potatoes, coriander powder, red chilli powder, black salt, green chillies and coriander leaves. Give it a mix. Stuffing is ready.

Step 2) Now in half cup of water, dissolve 1 tbsp of sugar. 

Step 3) Now mix in 1 tbsp of instant yeast and keep aside to proove for 5 minutes.

Step 4) In a bowl, add flour, semolina and salt and mix it dry first.

Step 5) Add yeast and water and make a soft and stretchy dough. The more you work on the dough, the better. Gluten is very important for this dough.

Step 6) Apply some oil on the dough and let it rest for 5 minutes.

Step 7) Now lightly knead the dough again and roll it into a cylindrical shape. Take a big portion out of it.

Step 8) Now roll it between your palms and make a ball. Now flatten it and make a dent in the center.

Step 9) Add a spoonful of potato filling and seal the edges. Flatten it again and make sure it's smooth.

Step 10) Apply some oil on rolling pin and rolling board and place the bhatura on the board. 

Step 11) Spread it carefully using your fingers. Then using a rolling pin, gently roll it into oblong or round shape.

Step 12) Now heat oil on high heat. We need super hot oil to fry these bhature.

Step 13) Add the bhatura in oil carefully and keep touching it's upper surface with a spider strainer. This helps it get balloony.

Step 14) Once light golden on both sides, take it out and let the excess oil drip off. Prepare all the bhatura like this.

**Note: Once your bhatura is done, lower the flame. And when you're about to add another one, put the flame on high just before it.**

Serve the yummy stuffed bhature with Hot spicy Chole.",5100

Mushroom risotto, an absolute classic of Italian cuisine, can easily made vegan without losing its distinctive flavor. Dry porcini mushrooms provide the richness and depth of flavor, while the white miso paste makes it creamy and savory. Here's my take on this fantastic dish

Recipe originally here: [https://www.instagram.com/p/CHU8o-shj6q/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHU8o-shj6q/)

This is probably the ""classic"" risotto, but there are so many fancy versions out there. Let me know your favorite risotto recipe!

**Ingredients** \[2 people\]

* 200 g arborio rice (short-grain)
* 1 large onion
* half a leek
* 2-3 garlic cloves
* 250 g chestnut mushrooms 
* A handful of dried porcini mushrooms
* 1 tablespoon white miso paste
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Salt and black pepper
* \[Optional\] half a glass of dry white wine

**Recipe**

1. Boil some water and hydrate the dried porcini mushrooms for 5-10 min. Don't throw away the water as we will use it as stock to intensify the mushroom flavor.
2. Finely chop the onion and leek. Cook them in a saucepan with olive oil for 10 minutes. Then, finely chop the garlic cloves, add to the vegetables and cook for a few minutes.
3. Slice the chestnut mushrooms, add alongside the hydrated porcini mushrooms, and cook for a few  minutes until the water they release evaporates. Add a tablespoon of  white miso paste; this will make the base for our stock and provide some rich umami. 
4. Add the rice, stir and cook for 1-2 min. Then pour the  porcini mushrooms along with the liquid into the pan, this will serve as  the stock.
5. At this point, if you are using the wine, deglaze the pan to dissolve all the brown caramelized bits at the bottom, and cook for a few minutes. Incorporate the rice and cook for a few minutes while stirring.
6. Add the liquid from the porcini mushrooms in batches while stirring the rice. If you run out of liquid, start using water (or vegetable stock). Cook for 12-15 minutes, until the rice is cooked. 
7. Serve with some freshly cracked black pepper.",2073

Ingredients : 

 - 500gr flour
 - 300ml water
 - 8-10gr yeast
 - 5-10gr sugar
 - salt
 - 1-2tbls honey
 - A mix of seeds
 - 1 egg for egg wash

Procedure :

Take 100ml of warm water and put the yeast in it with the sugar. Let it there for 5-10 minutes. It should bubble up.
Now take the flour, the rest of 200ml of water and put it into a bowl. Add the yeast with the rest of the water. 
If you want to avoid some stickiness use a wooden spoon at the beginning, or a dough mixer. Kneed until you get a dough that's not sticky.
You may need to either add a little more flour or a little more water depending on the flour you gonna use. I personally had to add 10-20 more grams of flour.
I put the dough into a bowl that I oiled before. Let it rest for 1 to 2 hours depending on your room temp.

After this, I divided the dough in portions of 140-150 grams. Make them into a ball shape and then poke your finger through the center of the ball of dough, then use 2 fingers to widen the hole.
Don't push too hard or you may brake the dough and you have
to start over. You need to make that hole bigger than you'd think. After you're done with the shape, cover the bagels for another 1 or 2 hours. 
When the shape grow in size, that hole will be 2-3x smaller than you made it.

Now prepare your water. I added 2tbs of honey after the water was boiling and mix it. Then put your bagels in there, but don't overcrowd them, and let them boil for 
2 minutes per side. The more they boil the chewy they get after. Also these are big bagels, but 2 minutes is enough.

Let them cool a bit before you egg wash them, and use your favorite mix of seeds on top of them.
They should go in the oven at 180 degree Celsius with fan on for around 20-25 minutes. 

And now, enjoy. You can eat them as sandwiches with creamcheese, or simple. Or don't put seeds on them when you cook them in the oven, and when they're done brush them
with some melted butter and sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top. Eat them with jam or whatever your hearth tells you.",2158

### INGREDIENTS 

* 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
* 2 Tbsp butter
* 6 oz onion (or shallot), thinly sliced
* 8 oz button mushrooms, sliced 1/4"" thick
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 c chicken stock
* 1 c heavy cream
* 2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 1 Tbsp thyme (dried or fresh)
* 1 c flat-leaf Italian parsley, roughly chopped
* Salt to taste

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Trim and pat dry chicken breasts.
* Pound chicken breasts to an even thickness, about 1/2"" thick.
* Season on both sides with 1 tsp kosher salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper.
* Add olive oil to a skillet over medium-high heat. After a minute or so, sprinkle a drop of water in the pan. If the water sizzles, the oil is ready to brown the chicken. 
* Add your seasoned chicken breasts to the pan. Dont crowd the pan; cook in batches if necessary.
* Turn after five minutes and brown the other side for another five minutes. 
* Remove the chicken and set aside. Do not clean your pan.
* Leave the skillet over the same heat and add butter. While the butter melts, you can use a wooden spoon to scrape up the brown bits and pieces that are stuck to the bottom of the pan. 
* Add onions and stir regularly for a couple of minutes until the onions become translucent and absorb the butter.
* Add the roughly chopped mushrooms and the minced garlic. Watch the heat and turn it down a bit if its too hot. The mushrooms should sizzle a little. 
* Once your mushrooms release some of their moisture, after about 5 minutes, add chicken stock and cook for another 10 minutes. 
* Add heavy cream, balsamic vinegar, and thyme.
* Bring to a boil for a couple of minutes to reduce some of the liquid. Let it bubble until it reaches your desired thickness. 
* Now its time to taste. Depending on what type of butter and what type of chicken stock you used, it might need a little more salt. 
* When the balsamic mushroom sauce is ready to go, add your chicken back into the pan, sprinkle it with a handful of chopped flat-leaf Italian parsley, and cook for a couple of minutes. Just enough to reheat the chicken. 
* Serve with your favorite side dish and enjoy!",2556

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

150g fresh, good quality beef for tartare (ask your butcher what they recommend)

2 eggs (1 at room temperature, for the mayo)

3-4 tbsp soy sauce

1/2 carrot

Small bunch of chives

Mustard 1 tsp: you'll need half for the mayo and half for the vinaigrette

Hazelnut oil, about 1-2 tbsp

1 orange: half of it zested, and 1/4 juiced

Vegetable oil, about 300g (but more if you like your mayo thicker)

1 tsp brined peppercorns

\[+ a few slices of toasted sourdough\]

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

1. To make the cured yolk, crack the egg open, remove the yolk and add it to the soy sauce. Leave it to cure in the soy sauce until you plate up.
2. Now, off to the mayo. The quickest and easiest way to make mayo is with a hand blender. Add the whole egg (at room temperature) to a bowl, add salt, oil, the chives and half of the mustard.
3. Blend, slowly, from the bottom to the top, until emulsified. If it's not thick enough, add more oil and repeat the process. It takes one or two minutes. So, so easy!
4. Peel the carrot, then dice it into tiny little cubes, a.k.a. brunoise.
5. Add the carrot to a mixing bowl.
6. Dice the meat. I don't know how you like your beef tartare, but I like mine to still have a bite. My butcher asked me if I wanted it minced, that's a no go for me. This is also why I like to freeze it some 20-30 minutes before I cut it. That helps me cut it into nice and evenly. Try that!
7. Add the beef to the bowl with the carrots.
8. Zest the orange. As much as you like. I adore zest, so I always add a lot.
9. For the vinaigrette: add some hazelnut oil to a small jar, squeeze some orange juice, season, add the remaining mustard and shake. Mustard is a surfactant, meaning that it helps molecules of fat and water bind - i.e., it emulsifies the vinaigrette.
10. Add it to the beef and carrot, and mix well.
11. Plate up and enjoy with a few slices of toasted sourdough.",1950

Pour   the prepared batter into the hot skillet, all at once, 	and  immediately  return the skillet to the oven. Bake approximately 20 to 25  minutes or  until puffed and 	golden brown (bake until the pancake  puffs up around  the edges - it 	may puff irregularly in the center.   The timing will  also 	depend on the size of your pan or skillet.

Carefully remove the pancake from the oven and serve 	immediately.

Once   out of the oven, the 	pancake will begin to deflate.  I normally serve   the pancake in 	the pan it was cooked in. Either bring the pancake to   the table in its pan 	or slide it onto a serving plate.

To   serve, cut into serving-size wedges and transfer to 	individual  serving  plates.  Top with your favorite topping and 	serve immediately.

For a classic German Pancake/Dutch Baby, 	sprinkle with freshly squeezed lemon juice, and dust the top with 	powdered sugar.

See other Topping Ideas above.

&amp;#x200B;

**Variation ideas:**   Blueberries - Pour prepared batter over approximately 1 1/2 cups 	 fresh  blueberries and then place the skillet in the oven. You could  also top  the cooked pancake with berries of your 	choice.

**Recipe Notes:**             Bread flour is a high-protein flour.  The high protein helps   the pancake rise. All-purpose flour             may be substituted but   the results will not be as spectacular.",3556

## Ingredients

**Sponge cake:**

140gr flour

20gr potato starch

1tbs honey

4 eggs

2 egg yolks

140gr sugar

50gr pistachios

**Pistachio ganache:**

400gr double cream (35%)

600gr white chocolate

100gr pistachio's cream centre

# Steps:

**Ganache:**

1. Put to boil the double cream with the pistachio's cream. When is boiling pour into the white chocolate and stir from the center to the outside.
2. When everything is well combined, use the hand blander to emulsify. **TIP:** A sign to recognise a quality ganache is the shiness (have a look at the video). 
3. Leave it to cool down in the fridge before using. **TIP:** More time it stays in the fridge more denser it will become, but it will always remain creamy. 

**Sponge cake:**

1. Beat the eggs with the sugar, together with the honey. **TIP:** The honey will add swetness and softness. 
2. When the mix is fluffy add your powders gently (flour and potato starch).
3. On a tray with parchment paper place your mix. You can use a piping back to make a square. After level it up with your spatula. **TIP:** If you have leftover mix you can use it as a base for a cake.
4. Bake at 170ºC for 10-12 minutes. 
5. When is cold, you can humedify the base with a bit of water and sugar. 
6. After, add your ganache. Chop some pistachios and spread on top, this will add some crunchiness to your swiss cake. 
7. Roll the swiss roll cake and decorate as you wish. I used some icing sugar, pistachios and cream. Have a look!",1645

What are small oats and large oats?  Is that just the size of the bags the oats come in so you need 1 small bag and 1 large bag to get the 60oz you need. Why give cup measurements if you already have the weight and an explanation of what size bag to buy?

2020-11-14,7,"My take on Chicken Crispy Strips With Curry Garlic Dip","zippopwnage","Who doesn't love some crispy strips !? 

 - First I mixed baking soda, salt, smoked paprika on the chicken and I let it sit for a few hours.

 - Next I added buttermilk, some chili, garlic powder and some more smoked paprika. Best is to let it sit till next day for a juicy chicken.
 - For the flour I used Garlic Powder, Paprika, Smoked Paprika, White and black pepper, curry powder, salt, oregano and basil.

Simple take your chicken from the buttermilk and coat it in flour. Deep fry it until golden brown. 

I made a dip sauce I really love with this chicken. 

 - Crush 4-6 cloves of garlic to witch you add salt and a little oil. Mix it hard with a whisk until it changes texture. It should be towards mayonnaise. 
(I think is called emulsifying?) Now add yogurt 3% fat and garlic mayo same amount. Curry powder (like a full tsp) and a little smoked paprika. 
Now add some pickle juice and salt. Play with the amount of pickle juice depending on how runny you want the dip to be. I personally like it a little more runny.

I really think that curry garlic sauce taste AMAZING with this chicken crispy strips.",1114

**Total ingredients needed**

* 225 g Butter
* 420 g White sugar
* 8 g Vanilla extract
* 120 g Pumpkin puree
* 1 x Egg (large)
* 330 g All-purpose flour
* 7 g Baking powder
* 3 g Salt
* 12 g Pumpkin spice
* -----------
* This recipe yields about 24 medium or 36 small sized soft pumpkin snickerdoodles.
* Tip: If you cant buy canned pumpkin puree, you can easily make it on your own by baking, cooking or microwaving pumpkin pieces until they are soft and then blend them to a puree.

**1. Mix**

* 225 g Butter (softened)
* 300 g White sugar
* 4 g Vanilla extract
* 120 g Pumpkin puree
* 1 x Egg (large)
* 330 g All-purpose flour
* 3 g Salt
* 7 g Baking powder
* 2 g Pumpkin spice
* -----------
* Sift all the dry ingredients together in a second bowl and stir until combined
* Carefully add them to the previous dough step by step while mixing further on low speed until just combined to avoid overmixing
* The dough should be very soft but still thick
* We used a stand mixer to mix the dough, but you can also use a hand mixer
* Beat the softened butter together with the white sugar in a large bowl for about 1 minute
* Afterwards, add the vanilla extract and pumpkin puree and mix for 2 minutes until combined
* Then add the egg and also mix until fully incorporated

**2. Rest**

* Store the pumpkin snickerdoodles dough sealed in the fridge at 4-6°C (39,2-42,8°F) for 2 hours

**3. Shape**

* ~120 g White sugar
* 10 g Pumpkin spice
* -----------
* Take a small bowl, fill it with white sugar and and pumpkin spice and stir until combined
* Take 2 baking plates and cover them with parchment paper
* Use a cookie scoop or tablespoon to get some dough out of the bowl to have roughly the same amount of dough for every cookie
* Roll the dough with your hands into a ball
* Coat it with the pumpkin spice sugar mixture on all sides by rolling it around in the bowl you previously set aside
* Place the coated dough balls next to each other on the baking plate (3 rows with 4 cookies per row)
* I went for 12 pumpkin snickerdoodles per baking plate so I had 24 in total

**4. Bake**

* Preheat oven to 175°C (347°F) with the circulating heat function
* Put one baking plate in the middle rack of the oven and bake for a total of 10 minutes or until the edges start getting brown
* After baking, take the pumpkin snickerdoodles out
* Info: I baked one batch with the circulating heat function and one with the upper and lower heat function. By using the upper and lower heat function, the dough diverged too much. If your oven only has the upper and lower heat function, you should bake at about 190°C (374°F).

**5. Serve**

* Let your soft pumpkin snickerdoodles rest on the baking plate they were baked on for 5 minutes
* Afterwards transfer them, including the parchment paper, to a wire cooling rack for further cooling for at least 15 minutes to set",2993

### INGREDIENTS 

#### Crust

* 10 oz graham crackers or gingersnaps
* 1-1/2 sticks unsalted butter, melted

#### Pumpkin Cheesecake Filling

* 1 lb Philadelphia cream cheese softened
* 3/4 c granulated sugar
* 16 oz pure pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie mix)
* 2 large eggs
* 1 Tbsp flour
* 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp ginger
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

#### Whipped Cream (optional)

* 1 c heavy cream
* 2 Tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Making the Crust

* Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers or ginger snaps until they're cookie dust...or very fine crumbs. If you don't have a food processor, you can place the crackers in a ziplok bag and crush them with a rolling pin.
* Place the ""cookie dust"" in a bowl and add melted butter. Mix with a fork until the crumbs stick together well when pressed between your fingers.
* Using your fingers, press the crust into the bottom and up along sides of the springform pan in an even layer.

#### Pumpkin Cheesecake Filling

* Preheat oven to 350°F.
* To soften cream cheese, either leave it sit out on the counter for a little bit until it has reached room temperature, or remove foil wrapper from cream cheese and microwave for about 30 seconds.
* Using a stand mixer or a handheld electric mixer, first mix together cream cheese, eggs, and sugar until well blended.
* Then, add remaining ingredients and mix just until well blended and smooth.
* Pour into crust and spread evenly using a rubber spatula.
* Bake at 350°F for 45 minutes.
* Wearing oven mitts, give the oven rack a good shake. If the outer 2"" have firmed up, but the inside is still a bit wobbly, that's fine. Turn off the oven, but leave the cheesecake in the oven for another hour, while it cools down...then put it in the refrigerator. Cooling the pie in this slow manner helps reduce the chance of cracking.  Chill for at least 6 hours. Serve with homemade whipped cream.

#### Whipped Cream (optional)

* Using a stand mixer or a handheld electric mixer, whisk together 1 c heavy cream, 2 Tbsp sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla extract until firm peaks.  Enjoy!",2314

###**INGREDIENTS:**

**For Gulab Jamun :**

* Mawa (Milk Solids) - 250 gram (1 cup)
* Paneer/Chena (Milk curdles) - 100 gram approx (1/3rd cup)
* All Purpose Flour - 4 tbsp
* Cardamom Powder - a pinch
* Oil to fry

**For Sugar Syrup**

* Sugar - 1.5 cup
* Water - 3/4th cup
* Cardamom Powder - a pinch

**For Kheer (pudding)**

*Ghee/butter (optional)
* Milk - 125 ml
* Mawa (grated) or Milk Powder - 1 cup
* Sugar - 1/3rd cup

**Garnishing**

* Saffron Food Color and Almond Slivers.

###**DIRECTIONS:**

Step 1) Take grated Mawa, paneer and all purpose flour and mix it and knead a soft dough. Keep it covered for 10 minutes.

Step 2) To make sugar syrup, add sugar, water and cardamom powder and cook for five minutes on medium flame. Keep stirring the syrup with a laddle.

Step 3) Take out laddle, wait for a minute and check a drop of sugar syrup. It should have one string consistency. (Check video for reference)

Step 4) Once done, turn off the flame and keep it aside 

Step 5) Now, take a lemon size portion out of dough and roll it between your palms.

Step 6) Make a smooth and crack free ball. Make as many balls as you can from the dough. Keep them covered while your making balls.

Step 7) Heat oil in a pan. We need to deep fry the balls so make sure there is enough oil for balls to swim.

Step 8) Add 5 to 6 balls at once. Do not touch them just yet. 

Step 9) After 30 seconds or so start stirring the oil around the balls and they'll start turning around.

Step 10) Touch them only once they've lightly turned golden or else you risk breaking them in oil.

Step 11) Keep stirring the oil and once the balls turn golden brown (see color in video for Reference), carefully take them out using a strainer while removing excess oil.

Step 12) Dip them immediately into warm sugar syrup. Syrup shouldn't be hot. Only warm.

Step 13) Let them soak in syrup for atleast 30 minutes. The longer the better.

Step 14) Now to prepare kheer/pudding, add 1 tbsp of ghee. This is not necessary if you're using milk solids as they already have plenty of fat. Milk powder needs bit of oil/ghee.

Step 15) On low flame, add mawa/milk powder and cook until you get a nice aroma.

Step 16) Add sugar to it and cook until it starts releasing oil. It'll easily take 10 minutes.

Step 17) Add milk to it and cook for 5 more minutes. Turn the flame off.

Step 18) Right before serving, take gulab jamun out of syrup and cut them in half.

Step 19) Decorate the center of the balls with a some food color (see in picture for reference). 

Step 20) Now add a layer of Kheer in a bowl and add gulab jamun pieces. Add some almond slivers on it.

Step 21) Add another layer of kheer and some more gulab jamun pieces. Finish it off with some almond slivers.

**Note: You can also cover the gulab jamun with kheer once it sets incase you want a dry version of this sweet.**",2916

* 2 pkgs. 6 oz each peach jello made according to package instructions
* 15 oz can sliced peaches cut into 1/23 thick slices
* 1 cup boiling hot water + 1 cup cold water
* 2 packets unflavored gelatin 2 packets = 14 grams or 1 1/2 Tbsp
* 14 oz can sweeten Condensed milk

## INSTRUCTIONS

* Make the first peach flavored jello consistent with package instructions (I used 2 cups drinking water for it to cool down faster), pour into a 9×133 glass pan, and refrigerate until set (1-2 hrs).
* After the first layer of jello has been within the fridge a minimum of 45 mins, start on your cream layer: in an exceedingly medium bowl, combine 2 packets of unflavored gelatin with 1 cup boiling water and stir until fully dissolved. Stir in 1 cup cold water. Pour in milk and stir with a spoon until blended. Let the cream layer sit at room temp (no over 45 min), then gently pour over your set jello layer.
* Once the cream layer is almost set (this takes about 5 min within the fridge), top with slices of peaches. Note: If you wish the peaches to remain put in a very pattern and not float up, you wish to put them on the cream layer before its fully set. Place back within the fridge to totally set.
* You want to begin your last jello layer right after the cream layer goes into the fridge. Make the second package of peach-flavored jello in line with package instructions and let sit on the counter until its the temperature (30 min  its faster if you utilize ice water) then gently pour over the highest of your set peaches and refrigerate until the entire jello is fully set. Note: dont pour warm jello over the cream layer or itll start to melt and become mottled.

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/ZmBjG35LXcs)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

\- 400g fish filet - 200g lettuce - 150g celery - 100g bean sprouts - 2 tbsps chili bean sauce - 15g dried chili - 2g Sichuan peppercorn - 10g ginger - 20g garlic - 1 green onion

Fish Marinade:

\- 2g salt - 2 tsps Chinese cooking wine - 1/2 egg whites - 1oz starch water (2g cornstarch + 1oz water) - 1 tsp oil

Chili soup:

\- 0.6L hot water - 3g salt - 3g sugar - 2g black pepper - 1 star anise - 2oz starch water (4g cornstarch + 2oz water)

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Slice the fish filet and marinate it for 20 min.
2. Under medium heat, toast the Sichuan peppercorn for 6 min, toast the dried chilis for 3 min. Take out the spices and blend them into powder separately.
3. Under high heat, add 1 tbsp of oil and stir fry the veggies for 3 min, add a pinch of salt and sugar, and mix well. Put them at the bottom of the bowl.
4. Under medium heat, add two tbsps of oil, add two tbsps of chili bean sauce and stir fry for 1 min. Add the ginger slices and garlic, stir fry for 1 min, then add the chili powder and half of the peppercorn powder, stir fry for another min. Add hot water and one star anise, let it cook for 5 min.
5. When the time is up, turn down the heat to low, add the fish slices into the soup and cook for 4 min. Add salt, sugar, black pepper, and stir gently. Finally, add 2oz starch water to thicken the soup. Mix well.
6. Place the fish slices on top of the veggies, add the chili soup, garnish it with chopped garlic, green onions, the rest half of the peppercorn powder, and a few dried chilis. Pour 1oz hot oil to release the fragrance of the chili and garlic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. The egg whites can help keep the fish tender, the starch water can prevent the fish from being overcooked, a little oil can keep the fish slices from sticking together.
2. The freshly toasted and blended chili powder and peppercorn powder are much more fragrant than the store bought powder. I highly recommend doing this step for this dish!
3. I used lettuce, celery, and bean sprouts to add some crunchy texture to the dish. Feel free to use your favorite veggies.
4. When making the chili soup, make sure to not add the ingredients all at once, otherwise they will overpower one another. Adding them one by one creates multiple layers of fragrance and tastes.",2607

The dense texture, no eggs...make this cake really good

-Apple Sauce-

 - 4 Apples (around 700gr of apple cubes)
 - Lemon juice from 1 lemon
 - 10gr of vanilla sugar
 - Cinnamon Stick
 - A splash of water

Bring to boil with a lid on, then after 5 minutes remove the lid, and let it boil a little more until everything is soft and mushy.
Remove the cinnamon stick and blend the rest. You have apple sauce! Let it cool down before using it.

-Apple Sauce Cake-

 - 3cups flour 
 - 10gr baking powder
 - 1tsp baking soda
 - 1tsp cinnamon
 - 3tbsp vinegar
 - 2cups milk
 - 2cups applesauce (the applesauce recipe I gave you should give you enough. For me it was exactly 2 cups of applesauce. To be sure you can add 1-2 more apples to that recipe)
 - 2cups sugar
 - 250gr butter
 - mascarpone and whipping heavy cream for cream

Start by mixing flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon in a bowl. In a separate one, start mixing
milk, sugar, applesauce, vinegar, butter until combined.
Now add the dry ingredients to your wet ones and mix well.

Distribute the batter in 2 baking pans. I suggest having the base a little thicker than the top. 
Cook for around 25-30 minutes at 180°C. Do a toothpick taste to be sure is done. 
The cake will look like is not cooked inside because it is not spongy at all. It is moist and dense.
But on the outside you should see browning. 

Don't take your cakes out of the baking pan until they get a 5-10 minutes rest. Then transfer to a cooking rack
to completely cool down

For the cream, you mix with a mixer whipping heavy cream until you get whipping cream that sticks in shape. In another bowl
mix the mascarpone cheese with a mixer, and then add it to the whipping cream and mix it again with a mixer until 
maintaining shape. I did not added any sugar to this, because the cake is already sweet enough and the whipping cream is usually sweet.
If you want it more sweet, you can add some powder sugar in the mascarpone cheese.",2082

* ¾ pound large shrimp peeled and deveined, tail removed or left on depending on preference
* 16 ounces dry linguine
* 4 tablespoons butter divided
* 2 teaspoons cooking oil plus more, as needed

* 1 red Fresno chili pepper trimmed and minced
* ½ cup dry white wine
* ½ cup reserved pasta cooking water
* S cup fresh parsley leaves minced

InstructionsPrepare the Scallops:

* Remove the muscle from the scallops and sprinkle with salt. Put them on a plate and transfer to the refrigerator as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
* Peel and devein the shrimp and pat dry. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the refrigerator.

Start the Pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Prepare the Seafood:

* Once all of the ingredients have been chopped and diced, prepare the scallops to be sautéed. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a wide pot over high heat.
* Pat the scallops dry thoroughly once more. The dryer the better!

Cook the Scallops:

* Melt 2 tablespoons butter into the wide pot. Once melted and frothy, add the scallops and dont move until a beautiful crust has formed, about 1 minute 30 seconds. Flip and cook an additional 30 seconds or so. The scallops should be slightly undercooked. Transfer to a plate.
* Pat the shrimp dry once more. Add them to the pot and cook in an even layer for 2-3 minutes until almost cooked through. Transfer to the plate with scallops. Loosely tent with foil as you finish the sauce.

Cook the Pasta:

* Right before beginning the sauce, add the linguine to the boiling water. Cook until al dente and reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.

Cook the Sauce:

* Carefully wipe out the excess butter from the wide pot. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the pot over medium heat. Once melted and frothy, add the finely diced shallot and fennel and cook for 4-5 minutes until softened.
* Add the tomatoes and red Fresno pepper (or crushed red pepper) and season everything with salt and pepper. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the tomatoes begin to soften.
* Turn the heat to high for 1 minute. Pour in the white wine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and boil the sauce for about 5-7 minutes until it reduces. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Finish the Sauce:

* Add the reserved pasta cooking water to the pot. Bring to a boil and cook for 3-4 minutes until reduced. Taste and season again to your preferences. Stir in the minced parsley.

Finish the Seafood Linguine:

* Add the cooked linguine to the pot and toss to coat. Add the seafood and cook for 1-2 minutes more until the shrimp are opaque and the scallops are warmed through. Turn off the heat.

To Serve:

* Divide the pasta and seafood between shallow bowls. Garnish with more parsley and fennel fronds. Enjoy!

2020-11-09,7,"Porcini, chocolate porcini puree, toasted coconut flakes, prune sauce","berriesandspice_food","# Recipe

**Ingredients to make 1 portion:**

2 shallots

2 garlic cloves

5-6 prunes

60g Butter

100ml Red wine

150ml Veggie stock

1 large porcini

2 tbsp sour cream

1 tablet of dark chocolate (preferably 85%)

A couple of coconut flakes (which you can roast in the oven until just lightly brown)

Salt

# Steps

**To make the prune sauce:**

1. Chop the shallot and garlic finely. Quarter the prunes. Sauté in about 20g of butter until soft.
2. Add the red wine and veggie stock. Reduce until the sauce has become thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season at the end, since reduced vegetable stock can be very salty. Strain and keep warm for plating.

**To make the porcini purée:**

1. Chop the second shallot, then sauté it in 20g butter on low heat until very soft. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Chop half of the porcini into small pieces, then add them to the shallots. Stir and cook on medium-low heat until soft.
3. Add the sour cream and the chocolate, stir until the chocolate has melted, then blend. Keep it in a warm place until you plate up the dish. For the plating, I transferred my purée to a piping bag. You can do that too, although it's not necessary.  
 

**For the pan seared porcini:**

To cook the other half of porcini, melt the butter in a pan, salt the porcini (porcino!?), then add it on its flat side to the pan and baste it like a steak. It's ready when you get a golden caramelisation on the flat side.

2020-11-09,69,"German cheesecake Teardrop cake","tmmydg","**Ingredients**

***For the crust:***

* 150 g flour
* 65 g sugar
* 65 g butter
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon baking powder

***For the filling:***

* 750 g quark (Got a lot of questions for subsitutes, check out my ETA below)
* 100 g white sugar
* 1 ½ - 2 Pck. (bake-proof) vanilla pudding powder mix (depends on the instruction for 500 ml milk)
* 500 ml milk
* 3 egg yolks
* 1 pck. vanilla sugar (or one vanilla bean)
* ½ Lemon(s), juice thereof
* Mix of 50 ml oil and 100 g melted unsalted butter (sunflower oil or rapeseed oil, definitly not olive oil, it has to be on that is neutral in taste. If you don't have one, skip the oil use 150 g of melted butter instead).

***For the meringue topping:***

* 3 egg whites
* 100 g white sugar

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

1. Make a dough using the ingredients for the crust. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes.
2. Mix the vanilla pudding powder with the sugar and add milk to make the pudding (alternatively you can probably make regular pudding, in that case let it cool to room temperature before using). If you have a mix that requires hot milk, let it cool before proceeding.
3. In a large bowl add quark to the pudding and mix well. Then add the melted butter and oil, mix. You should notice that this help smoothing out the texture of the mixture. Finally, add the eggyolks and lemon juice and mix until everything is fully incorporated. (Note: it is a quite liqidy mixture)
4. Pre-heat oven to 200° C. Roll out your dough, spread out in your sheeted 26-28 cm spring form. Press the dough against the wall of the form to build a crust of about 3 cm.
5. Pour your filling in and bake on middle rack for 45 minutes.
6. In the meanwhile, beat the egg whites while adding the sugar slowly until the foamy mixture doubles in volume. DO NOT skimp on the sugar here, otherwise the droplets cannot form.
7. Get the cake out of the oven and turn the heat down to 150°C. Gently splash the eggwhite spoon by spoon on the cake. Bake for another 20-22 minutes.
8. Take the cake out and let cool to room temperature. DO NOT remove the baking form or cover up before completly cool. While cooling, little golden droplets develop on the surface because the sugar in the eggwhite caramelize when exposed to the air. Due to this effect, the cake is called Golden droplet cake or Teardrop cake in German.

ETA: Since a lot of people have said that quark might not be easily found in their area, here are my suggestions for substitution:

* Here is a very easy recipe for making quark at home: [https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/240584/quark-homemade-cheese/](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/240584/quark-homemade-cheese/). I have not tried it myself but it sounds good to meand the consistency in the photo seems right
* Greek yoghurt (If it's very liquidy, drain it though a cheese cloth before use)
* Sour cream (same, drain if necessary)
* I would actually try half greek yoghurt and half sour cream. From my experience with the products you can get in Germany, I  think that would get the closest to the consistency and taste you are looking for.
* Cottage cheese should work well as suggested by u/wouser86
* If you are gonna use cream cheese, then try to find a light one.
* If you are using any of the substitutes, taste the mixture along the way and add lemon juice or sugar if necessary. There is no right or wrong to how sweet or sour it has to be, whatever you think is good should work.",3479

2020-11-09,17,"[Monday] What are your recipe questions?","bukworm","Haha yes, it's essential for us South Asians. I have one in US.. I had one in Canada. I also have a back up. I stayed 1 year without it and making everyday food like daal ( beans and pulses), some tough veggies, tough meats like mutton is very difficult. 

I am particular about taste as well .. the western alternatives like slow cooker is firstly slow, on top of that it comes out not tasting authentic. Wok is a better option in terms of taste, though it needs constant monitoring.


 Pre-pressure cooker age our grandmoms used to make everything in either woks or a dekchi ( deep heavy bottomed pan), takes hours and constant monitoring but tastes better than pressure cooker.


Also it needs to be indian style wok ( kadai) and not chinese style wok. The dish you mentioned is traditionally made in a kadai or indian style wok.

Just a tip - since you don't have pressure cooker add yogurt, lemon juice, a little meat tenderizer/ green papaya paste and marinate in advance.. if the recipe says marinate for x hours, add more hours to it.",1042
2020-11-09,1,"Bibimbap - Spicy Korean Mixed Rice","KoreanFood-2020","Bibimbap means mixed rice. You can make this dish with any of your favorite vegetables and also your choice of protein such as bulgogi. This recipe uses vegetables anyone can get from the local grocery no need to travel to a Korean market! This dish is a great way to use up vegetables in your fridge too. Depending on your area, you may easily find bibimbap sauce or gochujang at your local grocery.

Everything you need to know is below with a [6 minute tutorial here](https://youtu.be/WMijGwtAfNY) :)

INGREDIENTS for 2-3 servings:

* 2-3 bowls of cooked rice
* 1 bunch of spinach
* 12 oz (1 bag) of mung bean sprouts
* 5 shiitake mushrooms
* 1 medium carrot
* 1 summer squash (or zucchini)
* 6 cloves of garlic
* sesame oil
* soy sauce
* 1 tbsp rice vinegar (or vegetable vinegar)
* 3 tbsp gochujang
* 2-3 eggs

RECIPE 

1. Thinly chop the shiitake mushrooms, carrot, and squash.
2. Mince 6 cloves of garlic.
3. On Medium High heat, sauté the chopped vegetables using a drizzle of oil, 1 tsp of minced garlic, and a pinch of salt for each. To cook the carrots faster, add 2-3 tbsp of water and cover with a lid for 2-3 minutes.
4. Blanch the spinach. On High heat, boil 2 quarts of water with 1 tbsp of salt. Let the spinach boil for 30 seconds then transfer to ice cold water. Squeeze out any excess water.
5. Blanch the mung bean sprouts. Let the mung bean sprouts boil for 8-10 minutes then transfer to ice cold water. Squeeze out any excess water.
6. Add 1 tsp of soy sauce, 1 tsp of sesame oil, and 1/4 tsp minced garlic (optional) to both the blanched spinach and mung bean sprouts. Mix both of them well.
7. Create the bibimbap sauce. Mix together 1 tbsp of rice vinegar, 3 tbsp of gochujang sauce, and 1 tsp of minced garlic (optional).
8. Fry 2-3 eggs and add a pinch of salt to each.
9. Assemble the bowls! Layer on top all of the ingredients and mix everything together.

TIPS

* The taste of bibimbap highly depends on the sauce used. I recommend making your own sauce using rice vinegar, gochujang, and garlic. You can also add sugar and water as well.
* If gochujang is too spicy for you, replace it with soy sauce and sesame oil. This is also a great substitute for kids.
* You can also use any raw vegetables you like such as chopped red leaf lettuce, chopped seedless cucumbers, shredded carrots, or mushrooms. Just mix it all in!",2354

**Ingredients** **(makes one 10 inch roll)**

Chocolate sponge cake

* 25g hot coffee
* 10g dutch cocoa powder
* 60g egg yolks (\~4 large eggs)
* 30g sugar
* 45g milk
* 30g oil
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 55g all purpose flour
* 15g cornstarch
* 140g egg whites (\~4 large eggs)
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* 40g sugar

Whipped cream filling

* 300g heavy whipping cream
* 15g sugar
* 1 tsp instant pudding powder

Optional cocoa powder for dusting

**Directions**

1. Preheat the oven to 340F. Line a 10×15 inch rimmed baking sheet or jelly roll pan with parchment paper.
2. Pour hot coffee over cocoa powder and mix together until it forms a thick liquid. Set aside to cool.
3. In a large mixing bowl, beat egg yolks with 30g sugar on medium speed until thick and pale. Add the milk, oil, coffee and chocolate mixture, salt and vanilla. Whisk together until well incorporated.
4. Sift in the flour and cornstarch, then fold with a spatula until it forms a thick batter.
5. In a clean mixing bowl, beat the egg whites and lemon juice on medium speed until foamy. Gradually add in 40g sugar. Continue beating on medium high speed until stiff peaks form.
6. Gently fold the meringue into the batter in thirds. Once the mixture is well incorporated, slowly pour onto the prepared baking sheet to prevent any large air bubbles from forming. You may need to use a spatula to help spread the batter to the corners of the baking sheet.
7. Remove any remaining air bubbles by running a toothpick through the batter and/or banging the baking sheet against the counter.
8. Bake at 340F for 20 minutes. Cake is done when a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
9. Meanwhile prepare the whipped cream. In a clean, cold bowl, beat together the heavy whipping cream and sugar until soft peaks form. Add the instant pudding powder and beat until whipped cream becomes firm.
10. Once the cake cools, flip it onto a clean sheet of parchment paper and peel off the backing paper. Use a spatula to spread the whipped cream in an even layer over the entire cake.
11. With the short edge facing you, carefully start to roll the cake away from you, peeling off the parchment paper as you go. It may help to use something to hold down the parchment paper at the far edge to prevent the cake from shifting too much as you roll. If you see cream start to come out along the edges, you are rolling the cake too tightly.
12. Once the cake is rolled, adjust it so that the seam side is facing down. Use a sharp knife to trim off the edges. Transfer the assembled roll to a plate and dust it with some cocoa powder if desired.",2664
2020-11-08,4,"Fudgy Brown Butter Brownie","poor_coIIege_student","# INGREDIENTS

* 1 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (336g) (1 cup for melting, 1/2 cup for addition at the end)
* 2 teaspoon instant coffee (or instant espresso)
* 1 cup butter (224g)
* 3 eggs, at room temperature
* 1 cup sugar (192g)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (60g)
* 1/2 cup Dutch-processed cocoa powder (40g)
* Sea salt flakes

### DIRECTIONS

* Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line an 8×8 baking pan with parchment paper
* Place 1 cup of chocolate chips and instant coffee in a small mixing bowl
* Melt the butter in a pot over medium heat and stir constantly until it is browned and smells nutty. Make sure you keep stirring so the bottom doesnt get burnt
* Pour the brown butter into the bowl with chocolate and coffee. Let it sit covered for a minute then gently mix until everything is combined. Set aside while prepping the rest
* Crack 3 eggs in a larger bowl and break the egg yolks before adding the sugar. With a whisk or a hand mixer, beat the egg mixture first on low for 1-2 min, then high for 3-4 minutes. It should be lighter in color and doubled in volume. It will be very foamy
* By this time, the chocolate mixture should have cooled a little, but not cooled completely to room temperature. Whisk in the warm chocolate and butter mixture into the egg mixture. Add vanilla extract and salt and whisk until everything is incorporated
* Sift in flour and cocoa powder. With a spatula, fold the mixture just until there are no dry ingredients remaining.
* Add the final 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and fold the mixture to make sure the chocolate chips are evenly distributed
* Pour the batter into the baking pan and drop it on the counter a few times to get the air bubbles out. Bake in the oven for 26-29 minutes
* Once done, take the pan out of the oven and place it on a cooling rack. Generously sprinkle sea salt flakes over the brownie. After 5-10 minutes, take out the brownies from the pan and place it on the cooling rack. If you can, wait for it to fully cool before digging in!

This way all the ingredients are cooked to their best giving us a delicious dish with many textures and flavours. Be careful on the spice or wash it down with some Jamaican beer, the choice is yours!

**Ingredients for Slow-Cooked Lamb:**

* 1 Leg of Lamb
* 1,5L of hot stock (lamb or vegetable)
* 3 star anise
* 5 allspice berries
* 8 cloves
* 15 peppercorns
* 15 mustard seeds
* small bunch of thyme
* 20g (0.7oz) of fresh ginger sliced
* 1tsp of fenugreek

**Ingredients for Curry:**

* 50g (1.7oz) clarified butter
* 150g (5.3oz) Okra chunks
* 500g (17.6oz) of waxy potatoes - diced
* 2 medium carrots peeled and sliced
* 2 medium onions
* 2 medium tomatoes big dice
* 400ml (0.42quarts) (vegetable or lamb stock)
* 400ml (0.42quarts) coconut milk
* 0,5 lemon, juice to drizzle before serving
* fresh thyme to garnish

**Curry Blend:**

* 3tsp of turmeric
* 2tsp ground coriander
* 2tsp ground cumin
* 2tsp black pepper
* 1,5tsp mild chilli powder
* 1/4tsp of nutmeg

**Instructions:**

1. Begin by searing the leg of lamb over high heat, do it on each side then transfer to the slow-cooker, pour-over enough stock to cover it entirely and throw in fragrant spices from the list. Set the slow cooker for 5 hours or until tender.
2. In the meantime prepare the curry, in the pan heat the clarified butter then add carrots and onions, cook on medium heat for around 5 minutes then increase the heat to brown all around.
3. Add curry spice blend and cook to release aromatics followed by coconut milk, stock and potatoes.
4. Bring to boil and reduce to simmer. Cook for 20-30 minutes depending on the size of your potatoes.
5. Once potatoes are tender add chopped tomatoes, increase the temperature and cook for another 5 minutes.
6. Next, add Okra and turn off the heat. Once the lamb is ready, add it to your curry sauce along with one or two ladles of slow-cooking liquid (you can skip this step if you prefer thicker sauce or healthier version)
7. Serve the dish with a drizzle of lemon, chopped thyme, rice and some Jamaican beer. Enjoy!

=÷=÷

**Insight:**

* Okra contains a gluey substance called Mucilage which is a great source of soluble fibre. This is the same substance that you find in flax seeds and psyllium husk.  All plants contain it in different ratios and use it for transportation of resources.

2020-11-07,18,"Maple Syrup Apple Sausage Roll and Pumpkin Cheesecake Roll","zippopwnage","I tried to make a savory and a sweet roll these days. I've seen a maple syrup apple sausage recipe that I was interested in, and made it
into a roll with little modifications. I also made a Pumpkin Cheesecake Roll. 

Both of these works really great in cold weather, and eating them while they're hot was a pleasure. I have lots of recipes on my profile/account. Same on Imgur if you're interested. 

Maple Syrup Apple Sausage Roll

Ingredients for around 4-5 rolls :

 - 1kg Minced Meat (I used pork)
 - 50-100gr bread crumbs
 - 100-150gr of apples
 - 1 egg
 - 15 to 20ml maple syrup
 - salt, basil, smoked paprika, white pepper
 - Of course puff pastry. I bought it from the store because is good enough.

Mix the ingredients together, and make some sausage forms in the middle of the puff pastry. 
After you seal them, egg wash them and add some sesame seeds and flaky salt.
Cut them in smaller pieces. You start by cutting in the middle, and then you have 2 pieces. Cut in the middle again, and then repeat one more time.

 - Cook at 180 degree Celsius with fan on around 20-25 minutes. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
Pumpkin Cheesecake Roll

Ingredients for around 4-5 rolls : 

 - 650gr pumpkin puree
 - 400gr white cheese
 - 100gr light brown sugar
 - 10gr vanilla sugar and some vanilla essence
 - cinnamon by taste
 - 1 egg
 - 100gr semolina to bring everything together

To make pumpkin puree, just put your pumpkin in the oven until is getting soft. Mash it or put into a blender.
Mix everything from the ingredients into a bowl together until combined. 

You want your puff pastry to be cold. Add the mixture in the middle and try to seal it on top. The mixture should not be really liquid,
so it should stay without a problem on the puff pastry. If your pumpkin was too wet and you end up with a really wet mixture, add a little more
semolina.

After you seal the rolls, you take a toothpick and poke 3-4 holes in the roll on top, so it won't puff up and ""explode"" in the oven.
You can add sesame seeds on top. 

 - Cook it at 180 degree Celsius for around 20 minutes. 

Serve it with powder sugar on top and maple syrup.",2172

Most people don't know the secret as to how to tenderize the calamari the night before cooking so that it comes out perfect and with even more flavor.

**Ingredients**

* The desired amount of calamari, cleaned and cut (I usually make about 1 kg each time, it goes quick!)
* About 10-15 lemons
* 4 cups of frying flour
* Deep frying oil
* 2 tbsp corn starch (optional)
* 1 cup of milk/buttermilk
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp Red pepper flakes (optional)
* Fresh chopped parsley

**Directions**

1. Put all of your cleaned calamari into a large bowl. Squeeze about 5-10 lemons (depending on their size) into the bowl of calamari. Cover with plastic and leave in the fridge overnight.
2. The following day, take the calamari and rinse off any excess lemon juice. Then, replace the calamari in the same bowl and pour milk/buttermilk until they are fully submerged. Cover with plastic and leave in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
3. While waiting, take a bowl and mix your flour with your seasonings. If you like a bit of a kick, use some red pepper flakes. Add corn starch for that extra crispiness.
4. Take your calamari from the fridge and *individually* dredge each piece in your flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Set them aside for frying.
5. Preheat your frying oil to 375 degrees F, either in a pot or deep fryer no more than half full.

INSTRUCTION

* add 300 gr icing sugar and a couple pinches of cinnamon
* stir well
* add chocolate and candied orange
* put the cream in fridge
* take the dough from the fridge and divide in two part begin to work the dough with a pasta machine
* At the beginning may tear, do not worry just recompose and repeat. you have to repeat this operation 3/4 times, gradually lower the thickness of the dough, if you notice that the pastry is stretching too much divide it before proceeding.
* As soon as it will be smoother close the dough by making a fold on itself and pass it again in the pasta machine, the final thickness of the dough should be 1 mm
* help yourself with a little of flour for this operations if the dough is a little sticky
* Cut the dough in square 10 X 10 cm with the help of a shaped cardboard take a cylinder for cannoli, wrap a piece of dough on the cylinder, brush with the remaining egg the other flap and seal it.
* Continue with all the dough. It is important that the cannoli remain a bit to dry in the air before cooking.
* Heat the oil until it reaches the temperature of 180° C.
* Begin to fry the cannoli one at a time, placing them on a skimmer and keeping them immersed for a few moments.
* This way they will not touch the bottom of the pot and will not burn. It will take less than 1 minute, turn them continuously.
* Drain cannoli. Attention, in the stainless cylinder there will be a bit of hot oil so be careful
* Put the cannoli on a tray cover with absorbent kitchen paper
* Let the cannoli cold a bit and remove the cylinder
* Now take the cream and with the help of a teaspoon or a sac-à poche fill the cannoli
* If you like, garnish with chopped pistachios or candied orange you can also add a sprinkle of icing sugar

That's all! I will advise filling cannoli at the moment or a couple hours before at max or the cannoli shells will soften. The cream can be stored in the fridge for a couple days and cannoli shells can be stored covered with a cloth for 3/4 days at room temperature.",3706
2020-11-05,44,"Easy &amp; Delicious Pesto!","ZenRowndys","Pine nuts can be expensive, but the best thing about this recipe is you can use a variety of different nut and leafy green combinations! (The one pictured above was Walnut &amp; Kale!)

Recipe for the sauce can be found here!: https://bezeninthekitchen.com/pesto

Ingredients

2 Cups Leafy Greens (Basil, Spinach, Arugula, or Kale are best)

3/4 Cup Shredded Parmesan

1/2 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil

1/3 Cup Nuts, roasted (Pine Nuts, Walnuts, or Cashews are best)

3-4 Cloves of Garlic, minced

Kosher Salt &amp; Black Pepper, to taste

Steps

1. Roast nuts in a small pan over medium heat until golden brown and fragrant, (when you REALLY smell them, youll know theyre ready), remove from heat and let cool slightly.

2. In a large bowl, add your greens of choice, parmesan, roasted nuts, minced garlic, a pinch of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper and toss together lightly to combine.

3. IF USING AN IMMERSION BLENDER: Pour olive oil over the top of the ingredients in the mixing bowl and blend together with the immersion blender. Start on a lower speed setting until the ingredients have reduced in volume by at least 50%, then blend on high speed until fully combined. (Feel free to make it as smooth or as chunky as youd like! Also, stop to clear the blade of the blender a few times as well as scrape down the sides of the bowl in the blending process, just DO NOT forget to unplug the blender first.)

4. IF USING A REGULAR BLENDER: Add the ingredients from the mixing bowl to the blender and blitz together ingredients have reduced in size and appear more or less combined. Then, add the olive oil and continue to blend until reaching your desired consistency. (Also stop to scrape down the sides of the blender, as necessary.)

5. Now, it will be ready for whatever use you want! Pasta, pizza, sandwiches, it does not matter& but if you are not using it right away, press plastic wrap on the top of the pesto and make sure there are no air pockets, then place in the fridge until ready for use, (this will protect the bright green color of the pesto, if there is too much air, the sauce will turn a sickly brown).

6. Enjoy!

###**WRITTEN RECIPE**

###**INGREDIENTS**

* Onions - 2 big size
* Mozzarella Cheese  - 20 grams
* Breadcrumbs - 1 cup
* Gram Flour - 1/2 cup (Or 2 eggs)
* Water - 1 cup (skip if using eggs)
* Flour - 1/3rd cup (any flour)
* Salt as per taste.
* Oil to fry
* Coriander to Garnish

###**DIRECTIONS**: 

Step 1) Cut onions into thick slices. 

**Note: Cut no more than 2-3 slices from a one onion. If onions are too thin, cheese might slip away**

Step 2) Seperate 3 biggest onion rings and put smallest ring inside of the biggest one. This will give us the idea of how much gap there is between rings to fill with cheese.

Step 3) Now take cheese brick and cut strips out of it according to the gap size between rings. Cut them from the center to match the size of onions if required.

Step 4) Push strips inside of the gap of the rings. Fill smallest of the gaps with small small cheese strips. Do this with every set of rings and once done, refrigerate them on a flat surface for as long we are preparing batter etc.

Step 5) Take a deep bowl and add gram flour and salt. Add batches of water and keep mixing until we get flowing consistency batter.

**Note: You can also use eggs instead of gram flour and water. Beat two eggs into a bowl instead and skip step 5.**

Step 6) Take a plate and add flour. In another plate, take breadcrumbs.

Step 7) Now take onion rings and roll them into flour twice and then dip them into the batter/eggs and then in breadcrumbs.

Step 8) Using your clean hand, cover the ring with breadcrumbs properly. Flip it and cover from other side as well.

Step 9) Again, dip this ring in batter/egg and cover it again with breadcrumbs. Doing this twice make rings crispier and thick as well as strengthen the binding.

Step 10) Now heat up oil in a wok and once it's super hot, add 1 ring at a time.

Step 11) Once golden from one side, flip it using a tong and golden it from the other side as well.

**Note : If you're oil is properly hot, then don't fry them for more than two minutes, else cheesy might start to leak. They get cooked very fast so be careful.**

Step 12) Once done from both sides, carefully take them out and garnish with chopped coriander leaves. Serve hot with ketchup!",2276

For those who don't know of hojicha its essentially the superior brother of matcha (its actually the roasted form of matcha but I like it so much better than the latter). It's got a really amazing roasty toasty aroma and flavor profile to it, and it can easily replace matcha in anything!

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/JG7vw84wo6U)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

Pumpkin purée:

\- 150g pumpkin slices

\- 1 tbsp room temperature butter

\- 1g salt

\- 30g sugar

Dough:

\- 100g glutinous rice flour

\- 1g salt

\- 1 large egg

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Cut the pumpkin open and remove the seeds and the pumpkin skin. Cut it into thin slices and put them in a microwave safe bowl. Cover with a plastic wrapper but leave a gap. Microwave it for 10 minutes. The gap will allow the steam to come out.
2. Mash the cooked pumpkin. If there is water in the bowl, discard the water. Add the room temperature butter, salt, sugar, and mix well. (150g pumpkin purée is done.)
3. Add the salt and glutinous rice flour into the pumpkin purée and mix them. Add one egg to combine everything together. Knead the dough until smooth.
4. Roll the dough into a stick and divide it into 10 pieces. Put each piece in your palm and roll it into a ball.
5. Pour some breadcrumbs and sesame seeds into a plate, and prepare some water.
6. Take one ball, press it down in your palm and make it into a flat dough. Dip it into the water so more breadcrumbs and sesame seeds can stick to the surface. Repeat this to make more pumpkin pancakes.
7. Deep fry: Turn on the heat to high, wait for the oil to reach 300°F, then turn the heat down to low. Deep fry the pancakes until golden brown, then flip it to fry the other side for 1 min. Take them out and place them onto a kitchen towel to absorb the excess oil.

You can use canned pumpkin purée, but trust me when I say that a fresh pumpkin purée is definitely worth the extra effort. The inside texture of this gluten-free crispy pumpkin pancake is soft and fluffy, and of course it tastes like pumpkin :-)",1888

Ingredients :
 
Soup 1 

 - 60gr Parsnip
 - 100gr Carrot
 - 320gr Red Bell Pepper
 - 300gr Tomatoes
 - 205gr Onion
 - 6 cloves/20gr Garlic
 - 150ml Veggie Stock/Soup


Soup 2 

 - 80gr Beets
 - 30gr Garlick / 9 gloves
 - 150gr Parsnip
 - 220gr Celery Root
 - 150gr Red Onion
 - 130gr Yellow Onion
 - 120gr Carrot
 - 500ml Veggie Stock/Soup

Procedure : 

Start by washing and peeling your vegetables. Cut in small cubes/pieces. You want the rooty(hard) vegetables to be smaller than the softer ones (for example tomato, red bell pepper)
because the harder ones will cook harder. Pop them in the oven at 180-200°C for around 20 minutes, for soup 2 around 25-30 minutes. You have to check on them to see when they start getting
that caramelization and they become soft.

Put them into a strong blender and start adding veggie stock. You can replace a part of the veggie stock with cream. I personally don't like it with cream so I made it with veggie stock.
You can use chicken stock if you want that. Adjust the veggie stock/cream little by little until you get the consistence that you like.

In soup 2 I added a hot pepper, and it was super spicy, so take be careful about that.",1324

## INGREDIENTS

## Muffins

* 1-1/2 c apple cider
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 c granulated sugar
* 1/2 c brown sugar, packed
* 4 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted
* 1/2 c milk
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 c all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1/8 tsp allspice
* 1/8 tsp cardamom
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 apple, peeled, cored, and shredded
* Extra melted butter for greasing muffin pan
* **Note:** One time I made these and totally forgot to add the allspice and cardamom, and they were still delicious!

## Cinnamon Sugar Streusel

* 1/3 c all-purpose flour
* 3 Tbsp granulated sugar
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 3 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened
* 1/3 c chopped nuts - walnuts, pecans, whatever you like! (optional)

## INSTRUCTIONS

## Apple Cider Reduction

* The first step to making these delicious apple cider muffins is to make an apple cider reduction. Its easy! In a small pot, simmer 1-1/2 c of apple cider until it has reduced all the way down to 1/2 c. For me, this took about a half hour. 

## Cinnamon Sugar Streusel

* In a small bowl, mix together all ingredients using a fork or spoon. Continue mixing until small crumbs are formed. Thats it! Set aside for now.

## Muffins

* First, mix together the egg, both sugars, butter, milk, and vanilla until all ingredients are incorporated together.
* In a separate bowl, stir together the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder and soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cardamom, and salt).
* With the mixer still turning on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. This will come together quickly, so don't overmix.
* Then, with the mixer still turning, slowly pour in the apple cider reduction.
* Finally, mix in the shredded apple.
* Grease your muffin pan with melted butter and fill each cup to about two-thirds full. Sprinkle cinnamon streusel on top of each one.
* Bake at 350°F for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
* Enjoy with a glass of apple cider or a steaming mug of hot tea.",2398

###**WRITTEN RECIPE**

###**INGREDIENTS**

* Paneer - 200 gm (Cut into cubes)

DRY SPICES

* Kashmiri Red Chilly Powder
* Turmeric Powder 
* Garam Masala Powder

VEGGIES ETC

* Mustard Oil - 1/2 tbsp + 2 tbsp + as required for shallow or deep frying paneer.
* Salt as per taste.
* Minced Garlic - 1/2 tbsp
* Finely Chopped Green Chillies - 3 
* Chopped Beans - 1/2 cup
* Peas - 1/2 cup
* Finely Chopped Carrot - 1/3rd cup
* Sliced Onions - 1/2 cup
* Lemon Juice - 1 tbsp
* Chopped Coriander Leaves - as required.

* Rice (cooked) - 2 cups of as required.

###**DIRECTIONS**

Step 1) Cut Paneer into medium size cubes and add them into a bowl. 

Step 2) Add Dry spices, salt and 1 tsp of oil. Give it a mix. No need to rest it. You can use it immediately.

Step 3) Heat oil in a pan and add paneer cubes to it. Shallow fry them from all sides until they get crispy on the surface and their color turn golden.

Step 4) Once golden take them out. Save the oil as we'll use it in the next step. This step is important as the oil has all the flavour of spices and it's what that'll flavor the rice.

Step 5) Now in a pan, heat 2 tbsp of the same oil we used to fry paneer. Heat the oil on high flame.

Step 6) Add all the veggies except for onions and stir fry them while continuously tossing and stirring the veggies.

**Note: Stir fry on high heat gives it a smoky flavor. If you keep the flame low, it'll make veggies loose their moisture. If you added salt along with veggies, the same will happen so add salt onions.**

**Note: We haven't added onions in the beginning as they get cooked faster than other veggies and will turn golden brown which we don't want in this recipe.**

Step 7) Once the veggies are done, add onions and stir fry until they get translucent.

Step 8) Add salt, Paneer cubes and lemon juice. Toss them well.

Step 9) Add cooked rice to it and give it a gentle mix. We don't want to break rice so use a soft edged spatula.

Step 10) Add chopped coriander leaves and give it a final mix.

Cinnamon Rolls Recipe

To start the rolls, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk in a large bowl.
In a separate bowl, add sugar, butter, salt, eggs, and flour, mix well.
Pour the milk/yeast mixture in the bowl and mix.  If using a stand mixer you will want to use the dough hook. Mix well until well incorporated.
Place dough into an oiled bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
Roll the dough out on a silicone mat or lightly floured surface, until it is approx 16-18 inches long by 12 inches wide. It should be approx ¼ inch thick.

To make the cinnamon filling, combine the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.

Spread the mixture evenly over the surface of the dough. If you prefer, you can spread the butter first on the dough and then the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture.


Carefully starting from the long edge, roll the dough down to the bottom edge. The roll should be about 18 inches in length. Cut the roll into 1½ inch slices.
Place the cut rolls into an oiled 13×9 inch pan Cover them with a damp towel. Let them rise again for another 30 minutes until they double in size.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown. 

While the rolls are baking, mix all icing ingredients and beat well with an electric mixer until Fluffy. Spoon over hot rolls and spread as it melts.",1756

2020-10-31,7,"Swirled Steamed Buns (Mantou)","YungBaoBei","Alright everyone, finally an all inclusive guide on how to make the absolute perfect Mantou aka steamed bun. This is a Chinese classic, you gotta learn it.   
Check out my awesome video, subscribe and like &lt;3 [https://youtu.be/NiwycqFmXRA](https://youtu.be/NiwycqFmXRA)

Recipe:

* All Purpose Flour (800 grams) + An extra 100 grams
* Yeast (8 grams)
* Water (400-420 grams) + a bit extra later
* Oil (a splash)
* Brown Sugar (80 grams)
* Sugar (35 grams) + a teaspoon
* Salt (Large Pinch)

1. Create the yeast water by mixing water, yeast and 1 tsp of sugar into a cup. Mix it and set it aside to let it bloom for a couple of minutes. Mix Flour and salt into a bowl, the slowly add in the yeast water in increments while mixing. Once it is combined into a singular piece, begin kneading. Knead by pushing down and out while flipping the dough and turning it 90 degrees for 5-7 minutes. (See video for visual representation)
2. Shape it into a ball, the dough should be soft with a very slight resistance, lightly spread some oil on it, and cover it well to let it rise for 1-2 hours dependent on temperature.
3. Take it back out, push the air out and split into two pieces. Leave one piece covered in the bowl for the time being. Add Sugar and 50 grams of flour into the piece and continue to knead until combined. Once combined, knead by really stretching the dough out completely (see video). Shape into bowl and switch it out with the other piece. Repeat, but this time use the brown sugar
4. Switch again, so this time with the white sugar, dust your workspace with flour and start rolling the dough out into a rectangle sheet, not too thin probably .5cm thickness. Once that is done, dust a layer of flour on top, set that to the side and repeat the same with the brown sugar dough.
5. Lay one sheet of dough down and drizzle a thin layer of water on top to help the other layer stick. Put the other layer on top making sure that it's lined up, do any clean up work if necessary to ensure evenness. Drizzle another layer of water on top of the new layer.
6. Roll the dough up tightly and secure to avoid any gaps, once rolled stretch it out into the thickness of your choosing and ensuring that everything is even from left to right. Cut into 1.5 inch width pieces. Place on parchment paper, cover and let rise for another 30 minutes.
7. The buns should now seem weightless and bounce back with a gentle touch, put the in the steamer and steam for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and leave a small gap for the steam to slowly escape from. This will prevent wrinkles.

DONE! Perfect buns with perfect technique.",2635

**Autumn Pasta:**

Ingredients:

* 1 lb Mild Italian Sausage
* 1 medium Butternut Squash
* 1 lb Thick Sliced Crimini Mushrooms
* 1 bunch roughly chopped Asparagus, ends removed
* 4 cloves minced garlic
* 1 chopped yellow onion
* 1 cup Orange Juice
* 1 short log Goat Cheese
* 1 pint heavy cream
* Olive Oil
* Salt
* Pepper
* Thyme
* Nutmeg
* Cayenne

Directions:

1. Coat your Asparagus with olive oil and toss w salt and pepper. Oven roast your asparagus spears at 400° for about 10 minutes. 
2. Half your butternut squash, scoop out the seeds and yuck. Cover the inside with olive oil, salt and pepper. When the asparagus is ready, switch those out for your squash. Oven roast at 400° for 50 minutes.
3. In the meantime, do the knifework on your onion and mushrooms.
4. Brown up your Italian sausage into medium chunks, and set aside, leaving the drippings in the pan. Use those drippings and a bit more olive oil to cook up your mushrooms and onions, season to taste. You want these well done. Drop in your garlic, add your thyme, and let go for another minute or two before removing. Chop your asparagus once it's cooled and add it and the sausage to your mushrooms and onion.
5. Boil some water and cook your pasta. Don't forget to salt your water. Drain.
6. Once your squash is finished, remove from the oven and CAREFULLY scoop it out (it will be extremely hot). Add your squash, OJ, nutmeg, and cayenne to a blender or food processor (you'll want to be generous with the nutmeg, and more stingey with the cayenne). Add to a pan to heat. Slowly add your heavy cream into the butternut squash, mixing thoroughly. Let simmer for a few minutes, always stirring. Salt to taste.
7. Finally, combine your pasta, sauce, and goodies and mix thoroughly, coating everything in the sauce. Serve with a goat cheese medallion on top and enjoy!",1975

2020-10-29,69,"Dill &amp; Potato Stew","twunkie","This is a stew that was taught to me by a Czech mother, so Id like to thank her, wherever she may be. Very rainy where I am today, and this just made the house feel so comfortable.

The main goal of this stew is to fully develop the flavor of a few pieces of ham with some onions and spice, then use that to pair with the richness of potatoes and cream. The dill is the star, bringing earthy freshness that makes everything not feel so heavy. This dish does best with a good balance of those three. I dont measure anything, so Im hoping that my estimations will yield the same results.

Yields about 4-5 bowls.

Ingredients:
5 baseball-sized golden potatoes

1 bunch of dill

1/2 lb (8 ounces) of sliced ham

16 ounces of chicken broth

16 ounces of heavy cream

3 tbs of dried onions

1 tbs of butter

1 tbs of olive oil

1 tbs of all purpose flour

2 tsps of red pepper flakes or smoked paprika

1 tsp of chicken bouillon (optional)

1 tsp of garlic powder

1 tsp of black pepper

Salt to taste

Directions:

1. Dice potatoes into large chunks. Size is a preference.

2. Using a skillet, heat olive oil on medium heat, until glistening. Add ham and slowly roast until browned, just slightly on the edges, for some color and texture.

3. Add dried onions, red pepper/paprika, garlic powder, and black pepper. Stir into ham and roast the spices, until fragrant.

4. Add 1/2 cup of chicken broth at a time. Allow to heat before adding more, stirring each time in order to distribute flavor. Move on to the next step, continuing to add until all the broth is gone.

5. Heat an 8 quart pot on medium heat. Add butter until melted and beginning to brown.

6. Add flour and whisk until smooth in texture. If you have difficulty with lumps, then carefully add olive oil until smoothed.  Cold butter will not help. Continue heating until edges begin to simmer.

7. Whisk in heavy cream slowly, trying to maintain constant temperature. Each time you notice bubbling, to indicate that the mix is heated, add more cream until bubbling stop. The mixture should be slightly fragrant.

8. Once all cream and broth are mixed into their respective bases, turn off heat, pour the broth/ham contents of the skillet into the cream of the pot. Stir to combine.

9. Return the heat to low. Add the diced potatoes. Covering is optional. Let simmer for one hour.

10. After an hour, a mixture of fat and starch will flow to the top. Feel free to remove this. I dont think this adds any extra flavor here, but instead can leave the mouth feeling kind of gross. Best to remove and may be an excellent base to a poutine gravy.

11. Finely chop some dill ends, serve soup in bowls, and garnish with as much dill as you prefer. This is a strong herb and should be to ones individual tastes.


Hope you all enjoy this as much as me. I try to feed this to everyone that I love. I hope you love this as much as me.",2889

Step 4) Once tomatoes start releasing moisture, mash them a little with a laddle. Don't completely mash them as we want some chunks as well.

Step 5) Add in dry spices and cook them in Tomatoes' moisture for a minute.

https://bezeninthekitchen.com/special-k-bars

Assembly only takes around 15 minutes for these, you just have to be patient and let them set completely before slicing and enjoying!

Ingredients

5 Cups Special K Cereal

1 Cup Light Corn Syrup

1 Cup Granulated Sugar

1 Cup Any Nut/Seed Butter

1 Cup Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips

1/2 Cup Butterscotch Chips

Unsalted Butter, for baking tray
Steps

1. Pour the cereal into a large mixing bowl, (the biggest you have), and lightly crush the cereal with your hands, (you should have a good distribution of bigger and smaller pieces). Set aside.

2. Grease the bottom and sides of an 8x8 baking tray, set aside.

3. In a pot over medium heat, combine corn syrup and sugar, stirring continuously until combined.

4. When you see the sugar mixture start to come to a bare simmer, (bubbles forming around the outer edge), remove from heat and stir in the nut butter. (I prefer peanut butter, but to make them allergy-friendly, Sun Butter is a great alternative!)

5. Once fully combined and smooth, pour over the cereal and fold together with a rubber spatula until evenly distributed.

6. Press the cereal mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking tray. (For this step, make sure its really compressed. Use the bottom of a measuring cup or, ideally, a second baking tray to fully compress the mixture.)

7. In a double boiler or microwave safe bowl, melt the chocolate and butterscotch chips together. (In the microwave, melt in 30 second increments at 50% power. In the double boiler, keep chips in a bowl over small amount of simmering water at medium-low heat, stirring frequently until smooth.)

8. Once chocolate is smooth, pour over the top of the cereal mixture and spread with an offset spatula or butter knife to create an even layer. (If you want them to look like the bars from Yum! Kitchen and Bakery, add sprinkles on top!)

9. Let sit out at room temperature for 1-2 hours to set, then transfer to the fridge to chill further.

10. Once the chocolate is fully set, remove from the pan and cut into slices. (Keep stored in the fridge.)

Thank you all for the positive encouragement on my last post! I'm really enjoying making videos of what I cook. I'm sharing a miso fried rice recipe that I absolutely love.

A note about the rice  Ideally, you would use day old rice, but if you are craving fried rice RIGHT NOW, you can make the rice fresh. Just put it in the freezer for 15 minutes while you prep your ingredients! It will give you something close to day old rice. :)

Total Time: 40 minutes

Servings: 5

Calories: 409kcal

* 2 tablespoons rice cooking wine
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon white miso paste
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 2 teaspoons sambal oolek or sriracha
* 1 teaspoon chili oil optional
* 4 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2 teaspoons ginger freshly minced

Fried Rice:

* 3 cups cooked rice See Note
* 2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil divided
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon miso paste
* 4 eggs beaten
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced

InstructionsPrepare the Miso Butter:

* Melt the butter in the microwave. Add the miso paste and gently mash it into a paste. Set aside.

Prepare the Sauce:

* Combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl and whisk. Set aside.

Cook the Eggs:

* Heat 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil in wide pan or wok over high heat. Once hot, add the eggs and half miso butter. Using a wooden spoon, break the eggs up quickly as they cook for 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Its okay if they arent cooked all the way through.

Cook the Mushrooms and Onion:

* Heat the remaining neutral oil in the skillet over high heat. Add the mushrooms and onion and cook, stirring often, for 5-7 minutes until beginning to brown all over. Season lightly with salt. Remove from the pan.

Cook the Remaining Vegetables:

* Add the remaining vegetables and cook in an even layer for 2 minutes. Stir and continue cooking for 4-5 minutes until softened but but still crisp. Return the cooked mushrooms and onions to the pan. Season very lightly with salt.

Add the Rice:

* Add the cooled rice and egg to the skillet and toss gently to combine.

Pour in the Sauce:

To Serve:

* Divide the cooked rice between bowls and garnish with sesame seeds and sliced scallion. Enjoy!

Notes

*Note: Ideally, you would use day old rice, but if youre pressed for time, simply transfer the freshly cooked rice to a bowl and place in the freezer for 10-15 minutes as you prepare the rest of the meal.*

2020-10-27,4,"Shrimp &amp; Andouille Nachos","Tyrks42","INGREDIENTS:

3"" piece of andouille sausage, grated

8 shrimp, peeled and cut into ~1/8"" slices

Gouda cheese, grated

Habanero Colby jack cheese, grated

1 large clove garlic, minced

1/4 onion, cut into thin strips &lt;= 1""

3-4 pickled pepperoncini peppers, cut in 1/8"" circles

3/4 tbs salted butter

Kosher salt

Ground white pepper

Cumin powder

Splash of sangria wine



STEPS:

1) Set oven to ~180°.  Preheat 6"" skillet for ~5 minutes over medium heat.  On my ceramic cooktop I'm starting to doubt the number scale so I did this a little below halfway up the knob.

2) Add butter and swirl to cover. Add onion, garlic, salt and pepper. Stir and swirl for a couple minutes until it starts to turn a golden color. Add peppers, shrimp, salt, pepper and cumin. Stir and cook 1-2 minutes. Add sausage and a splash of sangria. Stir and swirl occasionally until sausage is cooked. Set aside.

3) Spread tortilla chips on plate. Spread meat mixture across chips. Sprinkle cheese mixture over the top. I know you love cheese but sometimes less is more.

4) Place plate on oven rack until cheese is melted. I would typically nuke this in the microwave and be done. The oven prep keeps the chips crisp and the cheese from turning into plastic cement. Caution. The plate will be hot. 

5) Serve with sour cream in a side bowl.

Thoughts:
I wanted the sausage grated into wide, thin strips. It ended up half stringy, half crumbled. Next time I might partially freeze it. It was still bomb.",1485

###**WRITTEN RECIPE**

###**INGREDIENTS**

* Milk - 4 cups (1 lt)
* Dates - 10 (Unseeded and Peeled)
* Thin Vermicelli - 50 grams (aka nylon vermicelli)
* Cashews - 4 tbsp (chopped)
* Almonds - 5 tbsp (soaked, peeled and sliced)
* Golden Raisins - 4 tbsp
* Pistachios - 2 tbsp
* Green Cardamoms - 6 to 7
* Dried Rose Petals - 1.5 tbsp or Rose Water - 1 tbsp
* Chironji - 2 tbsp
* Saffron - a pinch or 0.25 gram
* Sugar - 1/2 cup or 125 grams
* Condensed Milk - 150 ml
* Ghee (Clarified Butter) - 2 to 3 tbsp
* Kewra Water - 1 tbsp

###**DIRECTIONS**

Step 1) Take a wok and add ghee. Keep the flame on low.

Step 2) Add raisins and cashews and lightly roast them until raisins puff and cashews get golden. Take them out and collect them in a bowl.

**Note: Be very careful in this step as they get burn very quickly.**

Step 3) Add Chironji and roast until they get golden and start releasing their nutty aroma.

Step 4) Now add broken thin vermicelli and roast it until it absorbs all ghee and gets golden brown. It'll also start releasing it's aroma.

Step 5) Now empty the wok and add milk in the same wok.

**Note: You can use a different utensil for this step but the wok in which we roasted nuts and vermicelli usually has lots of flavoured ghee so it's gets added to milk and nothing gets wasted.**

Step 6) Add dates and sugar in the milk and mix until dates get almost dissolve in the milk.

**Note: To remove seeds and skin of the dates easily, dip them into boiling hot water for five minutes.**

**Note: Date is the most important ingredient of this recipe as it provides the base flavour to the pudding which is why the dessert is named after the persion word of Dates ""Khurma"".**

Step 7) In the milk, add all the dry fruits, nuts, rose petals and saffron. Cook this for ten minutes on medium flame while stirring everytime milk rises.

Step 7) Once milk changes it's color add condensed milk and give it a mix. Cook for another 10 minutes.

**Note: Condensed Milk reduces the overall cooking time of the recipe by a lot as it thickens the milk. If you skip condensed milk, you'll have to keep boiling the milk until it's reduced to half.**

Step 8) Once milk's color has changed to almond pink/brown add in roasted vermicelli and give it a mix. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes on medium flame.

**Note: Once you add the vermicelli, milk will thicken very quickly. So make sure you have desired consistency of milk and added everything beforehand except for kewra water.**

Step 9) Turn off the flame and add kewra water.

You can serve it hot or cold as per your liking.",2649
2020-10-26,37,"Onigirazu with Okra &amp; Smoked Tofu","mienczaczek","This Japanese sandwich made with seaweed and sushi rice instead of bread has a lot of potentials to become the superfood of tomorrow. What's interesting it first originated from Japanese manga ""Cooking Papa."" In the comic book, Papa is the guy working for corporation but a secretly amazing cook that lies to his colleagues telling them that all the outstanding food that he brings to work is made by his loving wife but she, in fact, is useless in the kitchen :)

It is super fun to make this and I love the delicate flavours that come through together!

=÷=÷

**Ingredients for 4 sandwiches:**

* 8 Sushi Nori Seaweed Square Sheets (Best way to buy in bulk on Amazon)
* 350g (12.3oz) of Sushi Rice cooked and seasoned
* 8 Ladyfingers - Okra, blanched in hot water for 1 minute
* 100g smoked tofu, pan-fried and glazed with soy sauce
* Mixed salad (beetroot, spinach)
* 1 Avocado sliced
* 1 small carrot  cut into matchsticks
* Half red pepper cut into matchsticks
* Japanese mayo
* Soy sauce
* Nigella seeds for garnish
* Plastic Wrap
* Small round dish or metal ring **(11.5cm in diameter and 5cm tall) (4,5 inch /2 inches)** to assemble (I used one of my small serving pie dishes and it worked great)

**Instructions for the small dish method:**

**1.** Cut a piece of plastic wrap bigger than a sheet of seaweed (It helps to hold everything in the shape) and place inside the dish.

**2.** Place a square of the seaweed inside the dish to fill its shape.

=÷

**3.** Place a layer of rice at the bottom of the seaweed (use a small amount of water on your fingers to prevent the rice from sticking)

**4.** Create the mirror layers of your fillings with the main item in the middle finishing with rice layer at the top (push the layers down to compress and keep in mind where the cut will be) You can also drizzle some soy sauce inside the layers.

**5.** Remove from the dish by lifting the plastic wrap and cover the top with another piece of seaweed (big enough to overlap slightly on the previous seaweed)

**6.** Wrap tightly in the plastic wrap to hold the shape then cut.

**7.** Enjoy with a drizzle of Japanese Mayonaise!

 **Insight:**  


* I found it easier to work with seaweed that was soggier. Take a few sheets out the packet and leave them on the counter overnight.

You can clip the blooms and keep them growing for a time, but eventually they stop producing good leaves. If allowed to bloom they eventually die back. It's just the life cycle of an annual plant. 

Buying young plants will get you more for your money.

Here another recipe with pumpkin!! A delicious deep fried pumpkin meatball with a surprise!! When you open it you will find a melted heart of mozzarella, cheddar or fontina! This is not only a tasty recipe but it's very easy too!!! As always if you want to see the video recipe [HERE](https://youtu.be/3P4eV9RZ5sg) and if you like the recipe and want to join the yt channel i will be grateful \^\_\^

How to Vegetarian Pumpkin Meatballs :

Ingredients

* 500 gr pumpkin
* 100 gr parmigiano
* 100 gr breadcrumbs
* 1 egg
* 60 gr assorted cheese
* 3 sage leaf
* salt &amp; Black pepper

**INSTRUCTION**

* Cut the mozzarella in slices of 1 cm thickness. Arrange them gradually on a tray lined with absorbent paper and cover with other sheets of paper towels.
* Cut 500 gr pumpkin in slices, remove the peel and put on a oven tray
* Season with olive oil and salt
* cook for 30 minutes at 140°
* mash the cooked pumpkin in a mixing bowl with a fork
* Add 100 gr parmigiano and 100 gr breadcrumbs
* add 1 egg, salt, pepper and 3 sage leaf finely cut
* make a ball with the dough and put in the fridge for 30 minutes
* Cut the mozzarella and the other cheese in small dices. This time i made these pumpkin meatball in three variations, mozzarella, cheddar or fontina cheese. For all the meatballs you will need a total of 60 gr of cheese
* take the dough in the fridge and form balls of about 40 gr inserting in the center some cubes of the chosen cheese.
* Close the meatball as to seal the cheese inside and work with your hands to give it a round shape.
* Don't make the meatball too big or the cheese inside will not melt from these doses you should get about 15 meatballs
* put every meatball in the breadcrumbs
* At this point, bring frying oil to a temperature of 140° and immerse the meatballs in oil for a couple of minutes, so that the cheese inside melts
* When they are golden brown, drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil

That's all! Like i said this recipe is very easy and remember : Eat while it's still hot!

I originally found your stuff here on r/recipes and the last few weeks when meal planning, I've just gone to your user page and grabbed a random recipe. I work through one a week, if that's a data point that your content is consistently good :) 

In addition to just keepin' on keepin' on I feel a few directions could be interesting and edifying:

1. Other genres of dish. Looks like you're already getting into desserts, and I imagine you could branch out to everyday lunches, sauces (or seasonings in the vein of your fragrant oil), other cuisines, or even drinks. I do appreciate you centring about amazing Asian cooking though, so keep that going! It's getting cooler out, so I imagine soups/curries/congee might be good to that end.
2. Teaching more generic cooking skills that transcend a dish. Cooking Asian food involves unique and particular skills that are not super commonly taught. Think of all the videos on sous vide. How many are there for using a bamboo steamer? For example, when I teach others, I like to focus on cleaver skills for deboning and dicing and santoku skills for mincing or fine work. Similarly, I feel a lot of folks aren't super exposed to the particulars of tossing stuff in a wok so it doesn't burn (or properly caring for a wok in the first place!). 
3. If you live in a city with lots of interesting markets or food destinations, you could also walk through your ingredient sourcing/shopping/exploration process. Could have some BaoBei To-Go videos in addition to the main recipe content?

### Equipment

* Wide pot

### Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon neutral cooking oil for frying
* 1 pound loose hot Italian sausage
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper optional
* 4 tablespoons butter divided
* 2 small leeks thoroughly washed, trimmed, and cut thinly into rounds
* 1½ cups arborio rice
* 4-5 cups hot chicken broth low-sodium
* 1 bunch Swiss chard stems removed, leaves chopped
* 2 ounces sage leaves chiffonaded
* S cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Brown the Sausage:

* Heat the cooking oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks, for 10-12 minutes until well-browned and cooked-through. Season with extra crushed red pepper, if desired. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
* Drain off excess fat from the pot, reserving any fond stuck to the bottom of the pot.

#### Cook the Leeks:

* Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the pot. Once frothy, add the leeks and cook for 8-10 minutes until very soft. Season lightly with salt and pepper.

#### Start the Rice:

* Melt the remaining butter in the pot and add the rice. Cook over medium heat, stirring regularly, for 2-3 minutes until just beginning to turn translucent.

#### Cook the Risotto:

* Add 1 ladle of the hot broth (it should be enough to mostly cover the rice in the pot) and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat to low and stir often for 2-3 minutes until most of the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding a ladle of liquid and stirring for a few minutes until absorbed until 4 cups of the liquid has been added. If you need more liquid, add another cup and allow the liquid to absorb.

#### Cook the Greens:

* Once most of the liquid has been absorbed, add the chopped Swiss chard, sage, and reserved cooked sausage. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring regularly, until the Swiss chard is wilted. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

#### Finish the Risotto:

* Turn the heat off the risotto and allow it to rest for 5 minutes. Grate the parmesan cheese into the pot and stir to incorporate.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the risotto between bowls and add a little more parmesan on top, if desired. Enjoy!

2020-10-23,90,"Homemade Cinnamon Rolls with Cream Cheese Frosting","Breeschme","I've never made anything with dough before, here is my version of the recipe I found:

**Recipe: Cinnamon Rolls**

**Ingredients**

**Dough**

* 1 cup whole milk warmed (105-140°)
* 2 packages (or 5 teaspoons) active dry yeast
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 5 cups all-purpose flour separated (plus extra for rolling out the dough)
* 3 large eggs room temperature
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter room temperature, cut into chunks
* 2 teaspoons fine sea salt

**Filling and Glaze(Egg wash)**

* 1 egg, room temperature, slightly beaten for sealing edge and egg wash on top
* 3/4 cup firmly-packed light brown sugar
* 2 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1/3 cup unsalted butter, room temperature, separated

**Icing**

* 1 block Cream Cheese
* 1 cup Powdered Sugar
* 1 tbs unsalted butter
* 1/8 tsp vanilla

**Directions**

* Grow the yeast: Add the warmed milk to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or just in a bowl. The milk should feel very warm to the touch, but not scalding hot. Use a thermometer to gauge exact temperature if desired. Sprinkle over the yeast, and stir to moisten. Allow to stand until foamy, about 5-7 minutes.
* Make the dough: Add sugar, 4 1/2 cups of flour, eggs, butter and salt to the yeast. Place remaining 1/2 cup of flour in a small bowl. Mix on low just until the contents of the stand mixer come together. Do not over mix. Double check to makes sure you have added all of the aforementioned ingredients before moving on to the kneading stage.
* Knead the Dough: I kneaded by hand for 10 minutes, adding in bits of the last of the flour as necessary. Here is from the recipe: Remove the paddle attachment and attach the dough hook. Knead the dough on low speed (e.g. speed 2 if using a KitchenAid® stand mixer), and continue to so for 5-7 minutes, adding in the reserved flour 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed, to prevent the dough from sticking to the sides of the bowl. Alternatively, knead the dough by hand.
* Dough Rise: Have ready a large oiled bowl. Once the dough is properly kneaded, appearing smooth and elastic in texture, transfer to the oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap, and allow to proof in a warm, draft-free spot until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 - 2 hours.
* Filling:  Have ready a greased 9x13 baking dish, and prepare the egg wash by beating together the egg with 1 tablespoon of water. Set aside until ready to use. To make the filling, in a small bowl, combine brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Set aside until ready to use.
* Roll 'em out: Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Cut in half with a sharp knife. Set one half aside, and begin working with the other. Lightly dust the dough with flour. Pat out the dough into the shape of a rectangle. Using a rolling pin dusted with flour, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring close to 12 x 14. Rotate the dough (if necessary) so that one of the short sides is in front of you.
* Fill 'em: Spread half of the butter across the surface of the dough, stopping about 1 from the short side opposite of you. Sprinkle with half of the cinnamon sugar mixture, and rub across with the butter, patting to adhere and taking care to leave cleared space at end for egg wash. Brush the clear area lightly with the egg wash. Set aside egg wash and reserve.
* Roll 'em up: Starting on the short side closest to you, begin rolling into a log. Once rolled, pinch together the seam and place seam-side down on your work surface. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut off the tapered ends and discard.
* Cut Rolls: Cut the log into 6 equal pieces. Stagger the rolls evenly across half of the greased baking dish. Repeat with the remaining log, and proceed to fill the dish. You should have 12 cinnamon rolls total. I wasn't careful enough with forming, rolling out, or cutting, so I got 16 and cooked the ends also. Unflavored dental floss is best for cutting them, slide a piece underneath and wrap it around up to the top and cross the strings and pull.
* Second Rise: Cover the rolls loosely with a kitchen towel, and allow them to rise in a warm, draft-free spot until they have doubled in size, about 40 minutes.
* Bake: Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 350°. Brush the reserved egg mixture across the top of the cinnamon rolls. Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Set aside and allow to cool slightly.
* Icing: Whisk room temp icing ingredients until smooth. Pour across rolls and spread.
* Inhale",4566

### INGREDIENTS 

* 4 c all-purpose flour, sifted
* 1/3 c granulated sugar
* 3 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened
* 2-1/4 tsp instant yeast
* 1-1/2 tsp salt
* 1 c whole milk
* 1/4 c water, at room temperature
* 1-1/4 c (2-1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened (for laminating)
* 1 large egg + a few drops of water (for egg wash)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Day 1:

* Add flour, milk, sugar, 3 Tbsp unsalted butter, yeast, and salt to the bowl of a KitchenAid stad mixer with a dough hook attachment.
* Start mixing together on low-medium speed, then slowly pour in the milk, then the water.
* Mix until all ingredients are well combined and dough pulls away from sides of bowl (about 3 minutes).
* Remove dough from bowl and shape into a ball. Wrap dough in cling wrap and refrigerate (at least 8 hours, but preferably overnight).

#### Day 2:

* Prepare the butter youll use for laminating the dough.
* For this step, I like to use my 9 x 9 brownie pan and a pair of gloves. Line the brownie pan with cling wrap.
* Place the butter in the pan and press all the butter into one even layer (the reason for the gloves!).
* Lift it out of the pan using the cling wrap, then wrap the butter securely on all sides. 
* Place the butter in the fridge and let chill for 1 hour, or until its quite cold but still flexible.
* Once the butter is chilled, you can start rolling out the dough (but leave the butter in the fridge for the moment).
* On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to approximately 10 x 24. 
* Get the butter from the fridge, remove the cling wrap, and place it in the center of your rolled out dough.
* Then, fold the sides of the dough over the top of the butter. Cut off any overhanging edges of dough from the top and bottom.
* Turn the dough 90 degrees and roll out the dough to approximately 10 x 24. Then, fold it in thirds again, wrap in cling wrap, and chill in the fridge, laid flat, for 30 minutes.
* After 30 minutes, remove the dough from the fridge, turn it 90 degrees (as in the photo above) and again roll out the dough to approximately 10 x 24. Then, fold in thirds again, wrap in cling wrap, and chill in the fridge, laid flat, for 30 minutes.
* After another 30 minutes, repeat the above steps for a third time. Then, wrap it in cling wrap and chill in the fridge, laid flat, overnight (at least 8 hours, up to 24 hours).

#### Day 3:

* Roll out your dough one final time.
* Start rolling out the dough (to an eventual size of approximately 10 x 30). When youve reached about 8 x 10, cut the dough in half using a pizza cutter, wrap half of the dough in cling wrap and put it back in the fridge.
* Roll out the first half of the dough to approximately 10 x 15. Using the pizza cutter again, trim the edges so that theyre straight lines.
* Then cut out large, elongated triangles for your croissants.
* At the base of each triangle, cut a 1 long notch. 
* To roll up the croissants, start at the base of each triangle. Spread the notch open when beginning to roll. This will push the points of the triangle outward, to give the croissant those tails on the outer edges, for their classic crescent shape.
* Continue rolling, tightly yet gently (you dont want to flatten all those layers youve worked so hard creating!), all the way to the end. 
* Place them on a baking sheet, with the point of the triangle underneath the rolled croissant and the edges slightly curved forward.
* Repeat the steps above for the other half of your dough in the fridge. 
* Once all the croissants are in place on the baking sheets, cover them with a tea towel and let proof (aka rest) at room temperature for 2 hours. 
* Two hours later, preheat your oven to 375°F. 
* In a small bowl, whisk together one egg and a few drops of water. Brush this egg wash onto your croissants, making sure to get the tops and all sides.
*  Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until croissants are nicely browned (I rotate mine halfway through, to ensure even baking). Serve immediately and enjoy!",4473
2020-10-23,5,"Brown Butter Sandwich Cookies [Matcha, Almond, and Chocolate]","Forced2bike","**Video instructions if needed:** [**https://youtu.be/tonqCi-DFc8**](https://youtu.be/tonqCi-DFc8)

**Yield:** 18 sandwich cookies

**Ingredients:**

**-- Brown butter --** 

170 g unsalted butter, cook then weigh and divide into 3 for each cookie dough below 

**-- Almond cookie dough --** (6 sandwich cookies)

25 g granulated sugar 

76 g all-purpose flour 

[ tsp baking powder 

a pinch of salt  

½ tsp almond extract  

**-- Matcha cookie dough --** (6 sandwich cookies)

25 g granulated sugar 

72 g all-purpose flour 

[ tsp baking powder 

a pinch of salt  

¾ tsp matcha powder 

**-- Chocolate cookie dough --** (6 sandwich cookies)

25 g granulated sugar 

72 g all-purpose flour 

[ tsp baking powder 

a pinch of salt  

2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder 

**-- Filling --** 

100 g white chocolate, chopped small

**Instructions:**

**-- Brown butter --** 

1. Cut the butter into smaller pieces. Then cook them in a heavy-bottom pan over medium heat. 
2. Frequently stir until it melts, turns foamy, and starts to brown. While the color is changing, watch for specks of brown bits. Once you see them, transfer immediately into a measuring jar to stop it from cooking further in the hot pan. 
3. Weigh and divide it evenly into three equal portions. Stir the brown bits in the butter before each pours to distribute them evenly. Each portion will be used for each cookie dough.

**-- Cookie dough --** (same method for three of them)

1. Into a portion of the brown butter, add sugar and mix well with a silicone spatula. 
2. Let the butter comes to room temperature. Then sieve in flour and baking powder. Add salt and the flavoring ingredient (almond extract/ matcha powder/ cocoa powder). Mix well.
3. Form it into a ball. If the mixture is crumbly (this can happen when the brown butter has turned solid), simply knead it with your hand. The warmth from our hand will bring the mixture together. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
4. Place the dough in between 2 sheets of parchment paper. Using a rolling pin, press it down a couple of times to flatten it out before rolling. Roll to 1/4"" (0.6 cm) thickness. 
5. Remove the top sheet of paper. Cut out as many circles with a cookie cutter. Transfer them onto a tray lined with parchment paper, then repeat the rolling process. If using a 2"" (4.8 cm) in diameter cutter, you should be able to get 12 circles for each cookie dough. 
6. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 15 minutes or until lightly browned. 

**-- Filling and assembly --**

1. Melt the chocolate over a double-boiler. White chocolate can easily turn lumpy when overheated, so heat just until it melts. 
2. Turn half of the cookies up-side-down. Either with a spoon or piping bag, add enough chocolate filling onto the center of these cookies. Top each with another cookie to make a sandwich. Enjoy!",2860

2020-10-23,10,"Flatbread doesnt have to be difficult and only needs basic ingredients.","southerngentleman90"," 

In fact, all you really need to make a basic flatbread is flour, water, and salt. Even the salt isn't necessary really. Hell, you don't even need a bowl or a spoon. You can make a pile of flour on your counter (cleaned counter I hope), make a little well in the center, and slowly mix in water with your hands until it forms a dough. Then squish it and toss it on a hot surface and you've got a basic flatbread that could be made on a rock in the woods with no tools other than the means to make fire.

Now that we've gone to the extreme end of simplification and removed the mystery of making probably the world's oldest bread product, I'll go into a leavened version that is only a tiny bit more complex, but will yield fluffy, chewy flatbreads with those characteristic air pockets.

Note: These amounts are mostly a guideline, not a hard and fast rule. Think of it as a starting point, in no time you won't even need to get near a measuring cup to make it.

**Ingredients**

2 cups all-purpose flour

1 1/2-2 teaspoons baking powder

A pinch of salt

3/4 cup of water

1 tablespoon of oil

**Instructions**

If you want to get fancy, use a bowl. For the record though, you can absolutely make this using the pile of flour method if you want. That counter's gonna get flour on it anyway so why not.

Mix together flour, baking powder, and salt. If you'd like to flavor it up with other seasonings (garlic powder for example) add it now.

Add the water a small amount at a time and begin mixing together by hand, or with a spoon, or a stick or something.

Once a rough dough begins to form, add the olive oil and mix by hand until a cohesive ball has formed. Add flour/liquid if needed during this process. We want dough that is pliable, but not too sticky.

Dust the counter (for the love of god make sure it's clean first) with flour and plop that dough boy on there. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it slowly springs back when you poke it.

Now we will portion it into balls somewhere between golf ball and baseball sized. A bench scraper is ideal for this, but I use an old, dull knife to separate into chunks.

Make the dough flat. My favorite way to do this is by gently pressing it out with my fingertips until it is about 1/4 inch thick, occasionally picking it up by the edges to stretch it out. I find that by hand-working the dough, we preserve more of the gluten structure formed from the kneading process. You can also roll it out with a rolling pin, can of beans, beer bottle, whatever. It'll still be very good, just make sure it's flat.

Heat a skillet to medium-high, using a bit of cooking spray if you feel it may get sticky (totally optional). Slap a flat-dough on there and watch it bubble up for a minute or two. Once the underside has gotten nice and browned and it's puffed up a bit, gently flip and cook for another minute or two, until the bubbles on the bottom have browned up. After flipping I like to mush it down very gently with the spatula to slightly even out the browning, but honestly I mostly do that cause it's fun.

As flatbreads finish cooking, place them in a stack on a plate and cover them with a towel. The residual heat will slightly steam them, making them soft and pliable.

Enjoy with wraps, curry, or topped with softened butter.",3290

[**Step-by-step Video Instruction**](https://youtu.be/GElBe3vT3mE) for following along, and ingredients/substitutions comparisons.

**Ingredients:**

* 4oz spaghetti
* 2oz pecorino
* 1 tsp whole black pepper
* 1 tsp wheat starch
* 1 tbsp cold water
* salt
* cooking water

**Instruction:**

Boil pasta in generously salted water according to package instruction.   Dissolve the wheat starch with cold water. Finely grate the pecorino. 3\~5 minutes before the pasta finishes cooking, start toasting whole   black pepper in a pan, until you can smell it (\~30 seconds).

2020-10-22,7,"Simple Apple Fritters","ZenRowndys","Recipe from my site: https://bezeninthekitchen.com/simple-apple-fritters

Ingredients

Fritters

2 Large Apples, peeled &amp; cubed/diced

2 Tsp. Lemon Juice

1/2 Tsp. Ground Cinnamon

1 Cup All-Purpose Flour

2 Tsp. Baking Powder

1/2 Tsp. Kosher Salt

1/2 Tsp. Ground Cinnamon

2 Large Eggs

1 Tbsp. Granulated Sugar

1 Tbsp. Light Brown Sugar

1/4 Cup Whole Milk

Vegetable Oil, for frying

Sugar Glaze

1 Cup Confectioners Sugar

2 Tbsp. Unsalted Butter, melted

3 Tbsp. Whole Milk

Steps

Fritters:

1. Peel and chop apples into 1-inch cubes and place in a large mixing bowl. Pour over lemon juice and sprinkle cinnamon on top then toss with a rubber spatula to evenly coat the apples. Set aside.

2. Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon into a small bowl, set aside.

3. In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat together eggs and sugar until fully combined, starting at a slow stir then slowly increasing to medium speed. (Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to ensure no sugar is sticking to the bottom and not mixing.)

4. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl and stir together at low speed until fully combined, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary.

5. Continuing to stir at low speed, slowly pour in the milk and continue to stir until just combined.

6. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and fold in the apples by hand with a rubber spatula until thoroughly distributed in the batter.

7. Fill the bottom of a large frying pan with vegetable oil, about 1 to 2 centimeters deep and heat on a stovetop set to medium heat until temperature of the oil has risen to 375 degrees F or 190 degrees C. (Wow, Im using the metric system now!)

8. Once the oil has reached the right temperature, turn the heat down to low or medium-low and drop 1/2 Cup of the batter into the oil. Cook until the bottom turns a deep golden brown color, then flip and continue cooking until color is even all the way around the fritter.

9. Using a spatula, slotted spoon, or kitchen spider, remove the fritter from the oil and place on a wire rack over a baking tray.

10. Repeat steps 8 &amp; 9 until out of batter, adjusting the heat of the oil as you go. (When the temperature dips below 375/190, turn the heat up slightly to bring back up, or if the temperature gets too high, turn down the heat.)

11. Optional: if you want to make bite sized apple fritters, just drop in individual batter-coated apple chunks and fry until golden brown using the same process described above! (Apple Fritter Donut Holes!)

12. Let fritters cool completely before covering with a sugar glaze.

Glaze:

1. Sift confectioners sugar into a small-to-medium sized bowl.

2. Pour melted butter &amp; milk over the sugar and stir with a spoon or small whisk until fully combined.

3. One by one, dip one side of the apple fritters into the glaze and then hover over the bowl to ensure excess glaze drips off.

4. Flip over and set the non-glazed side on a baking tray lined with a silicone mat. Repeat steps 3&amp;4 until all fritters are glazed. (If making Apple Fritter Donut Holes, simply drop each one into the glaze and roll around to evenly coat.)

5. Let glaze fully set before serving.

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/food/red-wine-braised-short-ribs/](https://maplewoodroad.com/food/red-wine-braised-short-ribs/)

### INGREDIENTS 

* 2.2 lbs beef short ribs, bone-in
* 2 Tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 head of garlic, unpeeled, cut in half lengthwise
* 3 medium shallots or onions, chopped
* 2 medium carrots, chopped
* 3 celery ribs, chopped
* 1 Tbsp tomato paste
* 1/2 bottle dry red wine
* 2 sprigs oregano
* 2 sprigs rosemary
* 3 sprigs thyme
* 2 c beef stock (or as needed)
* Kosher salt
* Freshly cracked black pepper

#### Gremolata

* Bunch of flat-leaf Italian parsley (about 1 c chopped)
* 2 tsp lemon zest
* 2 tsp orange zest
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 c extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Pat dry short ribs.
* Generously apply kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper on all sides of the ribs.
* Heat a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil in your Dutch oven until it sizzles when you drop a drop of water into it. 
* Sear the ribs on all sides (dont forget the corners) for about two minutes per side or until its nicely browned. Dont move them around while searing. And please dont crowd the pan. 
* When theyre all nice and brown, remove from the pan and set aside.
* Preheat oven to 300°F.
* If your ribs were very fatty, remove some of the liquid and leave about 2 tablespoons remaining in the pot. 
* Add the two halves of garlic, cut side down, and let them sizzle undisturbed for 1 to 2 minutes.
* Add chopped vegetables and 1/2 tsp each of kosher salt and pepper.
* Cook for 5 minutes while stirring occasionally. Adjust the heat so nothing starts to burn. 
* Add a tablespoon of tomato paste and stir so that all vegetables will get lightly coated and caramelized, about 2 minutes. 
* Add 1/2 bottle red wine and cook for about 2 minutes (now its time to use a wooden spoon and scrape all the delicious morsels from the bottom of the pan).
* Add the seared ribs back into the Dutch oven, top with all the herb sprigs, and add beef stock. Add enough liquid so the ribs are just about covered. 
* Place the lid on top and transfer it to the oven, leaving the lid on throughout the entire time its in the oven.
* Patiently wait for 3 to 3-1/2 hours. 

#### Gremolata

* Chop a bunch of flat-leaf Italian parsley and some garlic cloves and put in a bowl. 
* Add about 2 tsp each of lemon and orange zest, and a 1/2 c of olive oil, and mix. 
* Taste it before adding salt and pepper and see how you like the balance. If its too thick for your taste, add some more olive oil.
* Finally, add about 1/4 tsp kosher salt and 1/4 tsp freshly cracked pepper. 
* Taste again and adjust accordingly. Dont forget that this little herb sauce has to compete with big flavors, so make it count. 

#### Serving

* While this meal is delicious if served immediately, its one of those dishes that gets even better the next day. Just let it cool, leave it in the Dutch oven with the lid on, and put it in the fridge overnight. Reheat the dish over low heat until the sauce starts to simmer.
* Plate some pappardelle pasta or polenta in a deep dish. Place a rib on top (hopefully with the bone still in, for presentation), spoon the sauce over everything, and top the meat with gremolata. ",3365
2020-10-21,88,"Prime cut sirloin on a salt block","Supper_Champion","Ok guy, science is just a lie. All you're doing leaving a steak sitting out is allowing the surface dry out a little when you let it sit on the countertop, which is probably why it's turning out ""better"". The internal temperature of a 1.5"" steak will not change more than a few degrees in 30-60 mins on a countertop, not enough to affect cooking time or results.

Just because three ignorant people downvoted me doesn't mean the ""public"" agrees with you. The fact is, that despite your results, you are simply wrong and no amount of arguing will change that. Actual professional chefs have done actual controlled experiments to see if room temperature changes the interior temperature of a cut of meat in 30-60 mins and if it actually makes any difference to the final product. The answer again and again is no. 

Ultimately, letting a steak sit on the counter isn't hurting anything or making anything worse, so you can keep doing it. But telling other people that it is a technique that does affects the final outcome is just flat out incorrect.",1047

2020-10-20,3,"My Mini Pumpkin Pies Recipe","zippopwnage","Hey o/ I'm George and I'm back with another recipe. This time to be in theme with the season I made Mini Pumpkin Pies!

If you'd like to see some pictures : https://imgur.com/gallery/ZrDBwS2

If you don't make the pie crust at home, this is a very easy recipe, and anyone can make it.
I personally chose to not make my pie crust because after researching a little, it takes a lot of time, and the one from the store is good enough.

So Recipe (You can make 1 whole big pie or 15-20 Smaller ones like mine)

 - 750gr Pumpkin Puree
 - 140gr Sugar
 - 10-15gr Vanilla Sugar
 - 175ml Milk
 - 2 Eggs
 - 25gr Butter
 - 1tsp Cinnamon
 - 1/2tsp Salt
 - 1/2tsp Nutmeg(or a little less since nutmeg is really strong)

Now to make the pumpkin puree...that's easy. Cut your pumpkin in half, remove the seeds, brush it with a little vegetable oil, and cook it in the oven at 170 degree Celsius until your fork can go VERY easy trough them.

 - Now scoop out the puree from the pumpkin, mash it a little and when it gets to room temperature you can start making your filling.
 - Add the eggs to the pumpkin puree and mix until everything combines nicely.
 - Add the butter. Recommended here is melted butter, but I personally used one that was in shape but warm enough that it melts when you mix it with the filling. I got a great result. The point is to mix everything until you won't see the butter anymore if you want to do it like me.
 - Add the sugar, milk, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg. And mix until everything looks nice.

And now how to prepare the rest:

 - Prepare your pie crust to not be super cold when you try to put it in the tart shapes, but it should be cold before putting it into the oven. Use non-stick spray or butter to coat your pie forms.
 - You have to precook the pie crust. Make some holes in the bottom with a fork after you put them in the shape and put some weight on them with a baking paper (Beans, Stones, Rice) and cook them at 170-180 degree Celsius until you spot the first color change. At this point you want them to cook JUST ENOUGH for the base to not get fluffly. This steps take like 5-10 minutes.
 - Now remove the weight from them and cook them like 5-8 more minutes so you won't have a moist base. You want it to be crispy! It should be done when the base is starting to get color. Don't make them golden brown all the way, because there's a chance to burn them when you cook the pumpkin.
 - Add the filling to your pie crust or mini pie crusts, and cook them for another 15-20 minutes at 170 degree celsius, or until you see the crust having a great golden brown color. You don't want to burn the crust.
 - Now add whip cream and decorate them as you want...and Enjoy them! 

My SO made some little shapes with the remaining pie crust that we had. Some small pumpkins leaves and mushrooms. I don't know to tell you how to make them because I have no talent into shaping them. But, if you want to do it, all I know is that you need the pie crust to be cold when you shape them, and cold when you cook it.

I was SUPER HAPPY with the end result, even though I had a weird tube of whip cream and the blob of whip cream was a little weird. Now, I would love to hear if any of you have different secrets or ingredients that goes into this kind of pie?

2020-10-20,34,"Homemade Hot Dry Noodles","mienczaczek","Reganmian is a traditional Chinese dish where noodles are served with flavourful beef stock - lou mei and other garnishes like crushed peanuts, pickled carrots or beans, sesame sauce, soy sauce, fresh garlic, chilli oil, coriander and scallions.

Noodles are the main element of this dish so making fresh is the best way to go. My favourite is Udon, easy to make and tastes fantastic, I bet you will enjoy it as much as I did at the moment when everything mixes together and you take the first bite.

You don't have to add all of the toppings to make it delicious. Instead of chilli oil, I used my homemade chilli sauce and it worked great. I also pickled carrot with my quick hot pickle.

**Ingredients for Udon:**

* 500g (17.6oz) of plain flour
* 250g (8.8oz) of warm water
* 20g (0.7oz) of salt
* cornstarch for dusting

**Ingredients for lou mei:**

* 400ml (0.42quarts) of beef or stock
* 3tbsp sesame oil
* 20g (0.7oz) of fresh ginger peeled and sliced
* 3 garlic cloves peeled and sliced
* 1 small shallot sliced
* 1spring onion sliced
* 3tbsp Shaoxing wine
* 1tbsp brown sugar

**Spices for lou mei:**

* 2 small cinnamon sticks
* 3 bay leaves
* 10 peppercorns
* 20 fennel seeds
* 10 cloves
* 5 cardamon pods
* 3 star anise

=÷=÷

**Instructions for Noodles (4 portions) :**

**1.** Dissolve the salt in warm water and mix into the flour, knead for **8 minutes** until a smooth dough ball is formed (it may be hard at the beginning but it will soften as gluten forms) Then rest it covered to prevent drying for **30 minutes**.

=÷=÷

**2.** After resting it is time for final kneading and the easiest way to get it done is by placing the dough in a plastic bag and stepping on it until it spreads out then folding it into a ball again and repeating this two more times. You can also roll it with a pin but it is a lot harder to do so. After you finish rest the dough for at least **2 hours or overnight**.

**3.** Roll the dough flat to **1/4 of an inch** then fold it on itself and slice equal noodles.

**4.** Boil the noodles in salty water for **12 minutes** (do it in 3 batches) then run them  under cold water to set the starch on the outer surface (this makes them silkier and prevents from sticking)

**5.** To serve the noodles, deep them in boiling water for **15 seconds** then place in the bowl, add a small ladle of lou mei and garnish with other toppings.

**Instructions for Lou mei:**

**1.** Heat **3tbsp of sesame oil** in a medium pan then add, garlic, ginger and onion. Fry for couple minutes then add seven spices, fry for another couple minutes to release the aroma.

**2.** Add Shaoxing wine, beef stock and brown sugar then simmer for about **30-60 minutes.**

**3.** Once ready you can store in the fridge for up to 4 days.

 **Quick Pickled Carrot:**

* 100g (3.5oz) carrot, peeled and chopped into matchsticks
* 100ml (0.1quarts) of red wine vinegar
* 50g (1.8oz) of brown sugar

Combine vinegar and sugar then bring to boil and remove from the heat, add carrot matchsticks and make sure it is submerged. After 15 minutes the pickle is ready, you can store it in the fridge for future use.

**Homemade Chilli sauce:**

* 5 chillis (green or red) seeds removed
* 20g (0.7oz) of ginger, peeled and diced
* 8tbsp of chopped tomato
* 1/2 lime juice
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt

2020-10-20,6,"Chicken Katsu Wings","dosfiend2","So these wings are basically just wings made in the same style as pork tonkatsu. Utilizing the same sauce you'd have with tonkatsu as the base of the wing sauce with just a little bit of extra heat for flavor .

**Ingredients**

- 2 lbs Chicken Wingettes or Full wings (your choice)
- 1 cup Corn Starch 
- 2 Eggs
- 2 cups Panko Bread Crumbs
- 1 cup Tonkatsu Sauce (I use Bull-Dog Fruit and Vegetable Sauce)
- 2 table spoons Chili paste
- Green Onion
- Sesame Seeds

**Recipe**

1. In a large pot, heat a couple inches of vegetable oil to 325° F. (I find anything over 350° tends to brown the panko too quickly)

2. In 3 separate bowl place the corn starch, egg (beaten), and panko.

3. Coat each wing in first, corn starch, egg then panko insuring an even coating of each. (Don't be afraid to get a thicc coating of panko.)

4. Then carefully add the wings to the frying oil. (Depending on the size of your pot you can cook multiple at a time. I use a 9 quart dutch oven and could fit 10 wings in without dropping the oil temp too much)

5. Fry the wings for 8 minutes or until they reach and internal temp of 165°.

6. Let the wings sit out side of the oil for a minute or so then add to a large bowl for tossing.

7. In a separate bowl add your Tonkatsu Sauce (about 1 cup for every 20 wings) and chili paste and mix. (Add as much chili as you want based in your heat preference.)

8. Add the sauce to the wing bowl and gently toss the wings for an even coating. 

9. Plate wings, sprinkle chopped green onions and sesame seeds for garnish.

* Colander

### Ingredients

* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and diced
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper trimmed and minced (or use crushed red pepper to taste)
* 1 cup roasted red bell peppers diced
* 14.5 ounce can crushed or diced tomatoes
* 14.5 ounce can whole-peeled tomatoes
* 2 sprigs of basil
* 1 teaspoon sugar optional
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 16 ounces dry pasta of your choice
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Parsley dry or fresh, optional for serving

### Instructions

#### Start the Sauce:

* Melt the butter into a wide pot over medium heat. Once frothy, add the onion and cook for 7-8 minutes until softened and beginning to brown.
* Add the garlic, minced red pepper, and roasted red pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

#### Simmer the Sauce:

* Add the crushed tomatoes and whole peeled tomatoes and turn the heat to medium-high. Once the sauce begins to bubble, turn the heat to low. Add the basil sprigs and sugar, if using. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened and the flavors have melted. Add water, as necessary, to loosen up the sauce if it sticks.

#### Cook the Pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.

#### Finish the Sauce:

* Add the cream and pasta cooking water to the sauce and turn the heat to medium. Once it begins to bubble and thicken, about 5 minutes, turn off the heat and add the cooked pasta and toss to coat it with the sauce. Taste and season again to your preferences.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the cooked pasta between bowls and garnish with parsley. Enjoy!

As a suggestion, I say roast it, OR cut it into bite sized pieces to make a gravy. If you live somewhere where it's available, get some Tony Chachere's seasoning and mix it with mustard, we do that in the south a lot.

If you want something not so heavily seasoned, cayenne pepper and salt, or lemon pepper solo, and if you feel like exploring, there are many other seasoning blends and recipes for pork loin, just look around, or heck, ask your neighbor!",558

**Ingredients:**

1. Plain flour  3 cups
2. Salt  1/2 tsp
3. Sugar  1 tsp
4. Baking soda  1/2 tsp
5. Baking powder  1 tsp
6. Oil  4 tbsp
7. Yogurt  3 tbsp
8. Milk  1 cup
9. For garnishing:
10. Fresh coriander
11. Kalwanji or nigella seeds
12. Garlic butter

**Method:**

* In a bowl, add plain flour, salt, sugar, baking soda, baking powder and oil. Mix well.
* Then add warm yogurt and milk, and make smooth dough.
* If you need some more water, feel free to add more, and if you feel like the flour is too thin, you can add dry flour.
* Add a bit of oil and then cover it. Leave it for half an hour so it can rise a bit, then divide dough and make balls. Leave them for 5 minutes to set. Then roll them and make naan.
* Now leave the frying pan to warm up a bit and roll the dough balls.
* Add some coriander, and some Nigella seeds. Roll this slightly so they dont fall. Apply water to the other side so it sticks to the frying pan. Carefully put the naan on the frying pan and press on the sides to make it stick.
* When you see bubbles starting to form, turn it the other way and turn up the heat.
* When its cooked from both sides, take it out.
* Make the rest of the naan in the same way.
* Apply desi ghee so they look more delicious and beautiful.
* If you want, you can also add garlic while rolling or apply garlic butter when the naan is ready, like the recipe I already taught you to make. Whatever you prefer.",1620

They aren't going to win any beauty contests, but they are delicious, easy, and cheap.

I always eyeball the ingredients to scale for how many I need to cook, but here's a basic list so you can see the ratios:

**Ingredients**

2 cups AP flour

2 to 2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder (in general you want about 1 teaspoon of baking powder per cup of flour)

1 teaspoon white sugar

Pinch of salt to taste

1/2 cup chilled butter (make sure it's cold)

1 1/4 cups whole milk (also make sure it's cold)

**Method**

Mix the flour, baking powder, and sugar together. I like to put a bit of salt as well, although it's not necessary.

Take the cold butter and cut it into small pieces and add to the flour. At this point I use my hands to coat the butter chunks in flour and break it up by hand. I do this mostly because I'm lazy with dishes so I just do this whole recipe mixing with my hands. I've seen folks lightly freeze the butter and then use a cheese grater to add it in, which seems clever. I just keep it simple, the goal is simply to end up with small (maybe pea-sized) bits of still solid butter.

Add the cold milk a little bit at a time, mixing until a wet shaggy dough forms. Once again, I use my hands, but a spoon is probably the preferred method. What we want is a texture similar to an extra-thick flapjack batter, but a big thicker. It will be a bit sticky so don't worry about that. This is a fast and loose recipe, so don't worry about perfection.

Once a loose dough/batter is formed, it's time to drop those biscuits. Lightly oil a baking sheet and grab chunks of the dough and drop 'em on there. I go with slightly larger than golf ball sized, but this recipe ain't about being precise. Don't worry too much about shape, these are supposed to be tasty, not necessarily pretty.

Bake until golden brown at about 425 degrees. Usually this will take about 12-15 minutes, but just keep an eye on them and pull them when they look nice.

Try to contain your excitement and give them a minute before devouring. Give in, take a bite while they are still really hot, then do that funny breathing thing to keep them from scalding your tongue ;)",2166

Ingredients

Cake

16 oz. (1 lb) Fresh Strawberries, sliced &amp; quartered, divided

1 Tbsp. All Purpose Flour

2 1/4 Cups All Purpose Flour

4 Tsp. Baking Powder

1/4 Tsp. Kosher Salt

1 1/4 Cup Granulated Sugar

2 Large Eggs

2/3 Cup Vegetable Oil

1 Cup Greek Yogurt (2% or 5% milk fat)

1/4 Cup Lemon Juice

2 Tsp. Vanilla Extract

Glaze (Optional)

1 Cup Confectioners Sugar

2 Tsp. Unsalted Butter, melted

3 Tbsp. Whole Milk

1 Tsp. Vanilla Extract
Steps

Cake:

1. Wash and prepare the strawberries. Slice the tops off of the strawberries and separate into chunks and slices, (see image above). Set the strawberries on the flat end and cut two slices from the tallest point. Take the two remaining ends and slice into quarters. Place the quarters on a paper towel to pat dry and the larger slices into a separate bowl.

2. Toss the quartered strawberries in a bowl with the 1 tablespoon of flour, throughly coating the strawberries by using a rubber spatula in a folding motion, scraping down the center, then around the outside of the bowl, (this is so they dont all sink to the bottom of the cake). Set aside.

3. Grease the bottom and sides of a 9 springform cake pan with butter and line the bottom with a circle or parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and adjust the rack to the middle position.

4. In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

5. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, yogurt, lemon juice, and vanilla until smooth.

6. In one addition, add all of the flour mixture to the bowl and whisk until mostly smooth, but still a few lumps remain in the batter.

7. Using the rubber spatula, add the flour-coated strawberries to the cake batter, folding after each addition to evenly distribute throughout the batter.

8. Pour the cake batter into the prepared springform pan, then slam the pan a few times against the counter to remove any air pockets. Top with the sliced strawberries, (get creative!).

9. Place in the oven and bake for 45-55 minutes, or until the cake is set and a skewer comes out clean.

10. Let cool completely before releasing the sides of the springform pan.

11. Top with either confectioners sugar or a vanilla glaze, (HIGHLY recommended, see below), before slicing and serving.

12. Enjoy!

Glaze (if using):

1. In a small bowl, sift or whisk confectioners sugar to remove any large clumps.

2. Add the butter, milk, and vanilla and stir until combined. (Add more milk if needed to reach a good consistency for pouring over the cake.)

3. Once desired consistency is reached, pour over the top of the cake, spreading it evenly so it falls down the sides as well.

4. Let dry/set completely before slicing and serving.

5. Enjoy!",2837

Ingredients: 

1 3.5-4lb whole chicken

2 tbsp kosher salt, plus more

2 tbsp Black Pepper 

1/2 cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)

1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil

2 heads of garlic

1 1/2 inch piece of fresh ginger

1.5 lb baby Yukon Gold potatoes, about 1.5 inches in diameter

5 scallions

2 limes

Equipment:

1 Large fireproof pot

1 Charcoal grill

Apple or Cherry wood for smoking

1 Medium-sized bowl

1 Sauce brush

1 Sheet pan

Directions:

 1. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and put on a baking sheet. Season chicken all over with 2 Tbsp kosher salt and a copious amount of black pepper, making sure not to forget the inside of the chicken cavity. Let the chicken sit uncovered in the fridge overnight. 

 2. Preheat the grill/oven to 300 degrees. 

 3. Combine 1/2 cup gochujang and 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil in a bowl. Mince 5 garlic cloves into mixture. Peel and mince the fresh ginger, and then mix to combine. 

 4. Cut the rest of the garlic cloves longwise. Place at the bottom of the pot.

 5. Brush the gochujang mixture over all of the chicken, both sides. 

 6. Toss potatoes in the rest of the gochujang mixture, season with some additional salt and pepper. 

 7. Line the bottom of the pan with coated potatoes, next to the garlic. Then, place the chicken on top of the potatoes 

 8. Let chicken smoke/roast for about 2.5 hours. I recommend using apple or cherry wood for this recipe if able, any wood would be a good choice though. Then let rest for 10-15 minutes (be patient).

 9. Slice 5 scallions thinly. Cut the 2 limes in half. Slice one lime into wedges and the other use as juice to add to the flavor of the potatoes. Sprinkle scallions onto potatoes. 

 10. Carve chicken and combine ingredients-enjoy!

* Large pot
* Colander

### Ingredients

* 1 pound pasta of your choice

* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 leeks trimmed, rinsed, and thinly sliced into rounds
* 1½ pounds cherry tomatoes or 1 or 2 15-ounce cans crushed or diced tomatoes

**Note: If you want it super soft then cook for 4-5 whistles more and let it depressurize naturally.**

Step 2) Now take a wok and add clarified butter (ghee) and add green chillies and yogurt. Cook them on low flame for 4 minutes while continuosly stirring. 

Step 4) Add all of dry spices and mix well. Cook until it starts releasing oil.

Step 5) Add salt as per taste. Keep in mind that the Chickpeas water that we'll be adding in this will also have salt.

Step 6) Add Chickpeas/kidney beans and roast them in the oil for 3-4 minutes.

Step 7) Now mix rice flour in 50 ml of water and make a slurry. Add this to Chickpeas. This will add thickness to the gravy.

**Note: You can also add corn flour instead of rice flour but traditionally rice flour is used.**

Step 8) Now add the Chickpeas stock in this and cook it covered for 25 minutes on low medium flame. In 25 minutes it'll thicken up and become smooth and silky.

Garnish it with chopped green chillies and onion rings. Serve it hot with rice, flatbread and salad.",1966

4. One at a time, beat in the eggs at low speed until combined. Then add vanilla and maple syrup and stir to combine.

5. In two additions, mix in the dry ingredients and stir together at low speed until combined, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary.

6. Add oats to the mixture and stir to fully combine. Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir the dough a few times with a rubber spatula to ensure everything is evenly distributed.

7. Using a 1/3 Cup scoop, form balls of dough and generally space each cookie apart on the prepared baking trays. (This recipe produces 10 cookies, so 5 cookies should fit on each tray!)

8. One sheet at a time, bake the cookies for 14-20 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown, turning the tray once halfway through.

9. Allow to cool almost completely before applying the glaze.

1. Once cookies are properly cooled, one by one dunk the tops of the cookies into the glaze and hold upside down briefly to drip off the excess.

2. Place back on the baking tray and allow glaze to set, about 30-60 minutes.

3. Enjoy!",2368

Also after making the dip you could put mozzarella or gruyere on top, this will give it a nice crust. You should thin the cream cheese out with a veggie or seafood stock. I would love to hear if you revised anything and how it turns out.

\- 60g dried rice noodles

\- 80g tofu

\- 6 large deveined tail-on shrimps

\- 60g bean sprouts

\- 2 green onions

\- 1 large egg

**Pad Thai sauce:**

\- 1 tbsp fish sauce

\- 3 tbsp rice vinegar

\- 2 tbsp brown sugar

\- 1 tbsp white sugar

\- 1 tbsp sriracha (adjust as necessary)

**Garnish:**

\- 1 lime wedge

\- crushed peanuts

\- chili powder

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/GYwvb2RefWg)

**Directions:**

1. Soak the rice noodle in warm water for 30 min if your time is limited. (I usually soak them in cold water overnight).
2. Cut the tofu into cubes. Turn on the stove to medium to high heat, add oil and pan fry the tofu for 2 min or until golden brown. Flip the tofu to pan fry the other side. Add shrimp and pan fry each side for 45 seconds to 1 min.
3. Make some space for the noodle. Add a little bit oil and the rice noodles. Stir fry for 45 seconds. Then add the sauce, mix all the ingredients together, stir and let it soak up the sauce.
4. When the sauce is mostly absorbed (it took me one minute and 45 seconds), make some space for the scrambled eggs. Add a little bit oil and crack one egg into the open area. Let it fry up for 10 seconds before scrambling.
5. Mix everything in the pan together and add bean sprouts and green onions. Cook for 1 min. (Use half of the bean sprouts and leave some for plating)
6. Garnish and enjoy!

**Notes:**

1. Usually the pad Thai sauce is made with tamarind which is a sweet and sour fruit. The tamarind paste is sold in some Asian markets. But if you don't have access to tamarind, you can substitute with a combination of rice vinegar and brown sugar as demonstrated in this recipe.
2. The pad Thai noodle should be moist, if you overcooked the noodle, just sprinkle some water to re-hydrate the noodle.",1850
2020-10-13,3,"I made Scallion Pancakes With Cheese for the first time!","zippopwnage","Hi, I'm George and I come with a new recipe! Today I made Scallion Pancakes for the first time!
I really enjoyed eating these. That crispiness and the fluffly layers in the middle, with the cheese...is just a pleasure when you bite into them.
This recipe wasn't really hard to make, especially as you don't need to wait for the dough to rise and nothing is sticky. 

I used this recipe : 

Ingredients : 
 - 5 Cups of Flour
 - 2 Tsp salt (or a little more if you want them salty)
 - 2 Cups of Almost boiling water

For the oil that you need to brush them before rolling

 - 6-7 Tblsp of vegatable oil + 1 tblsp of sesame oil
 - Salt and spices that you enjoy. Garlic, Onion powder. 
 - 4 Tblsp of flour

Procedure : 

 - You start by adding the flour in a bowl along with the salt and then the hot/almost boiling water. Mix it at low speed with the mixer, or use a wooden spoon.
 - Mix until everything combies and is not sticky. When you put your finger on the dough it should come out clean.
 - Let it rest for 10-15 minutes to cooldown a little covered with a plastic sheet and prepare the oil.
 - Put everything in a sauce pan and mix it at a low heat constantly to not get lumps of flour. When it starts to boil, you're done. 
 - Now, cut the dough in how many peices you would like. I cut mine in 8 smaller ones because is easier to fry them.
 - Roll them thin enough with a rolling pin, but not really thin. You should not be able to see trough it. You should have in mind 2 things. 
 - Long ---- and wide |   You should make it longer than wider. But keep in mind that the wider it is, the more layers you will have and those are a pleasure when you eat it.
 - After you roll the dough, brush it with the oil, this will help keeping those layers to not stick. Add the fillings Cheese, Scallions but be sure to not overfill.
 - After that, roll it as tight as you can from the wide part with your hand. Now you should have a roll. Take 1 end and roll it to the other. Press everything with the palm of your hand, add a little flour, and use the rolling pin to thin and form the pancake. Don't press TOO hard on it, and it doesn't matter if it brakes a little here and there. 
 - Fry in hot oil (don't deep fry), 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.
 - You can enjoy it with some cream cheese!",2311

2020-10-13,3,"Lemon Chicken Orzo Soup","Breeschme","This is a combo of several recipes I found for this. I like how it turned out.

Recipe: Lemon Chicken Orzo Soup

**Ingredients**

* 1 to 1.5 lbs shredded chicken
* 1 large onion or 2 small, I used white.
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 carrots, cut and diced small
* 2 celery stalks, cut in thin half moons
* Juice and a lil zest of 1.5 lemons (2 for more lemony flavor, I did two and wanted a little less lemony next time, recipes I pulled from called for 1.5 to 2)
* 1/4 tsp oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning
* 1/4 teaspoon thyme
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black ground pepper
* 1 bay leaf
* 8 cups of water + 8 tsp of Chicken Better than Bullion OR 8 cups of chicken broth
* 1 bunch Italian Parsley
* 1 cup baby spinach
* 2 tbs olive oil
* 1/2 to 1 cup of Dry Orzo (recipes varied wildly on amount of pasta, I used 1/2 cup and it seemed good)
* Garlic powder, salt, and pepper to taste on chicken
* Chicken Stock or Broth to cook shredded chicken, Better than Bullion can work for this, too. 

**Directions**

1. Heat pan on medium heat and then add 1 Tbs olive oil to pan and heat. Add salt, pepper, garlic powder to raw chicken on each side and brown in pan for a few minutes each side. Add chicken stock and water until liquid reaches one inch above chicken. Bring to a boil and cook until mostly or completely cooked (it will cook some in soup). Shred and set aside.
2. While chicken is cooking you can chop up veggies. Heat up large stock pot on medium heat (I dont have a Dutch oven, not sure if it would work here) and add 1 tbs olive oil and heat. Add veggies and cook and stir until onions start to get translucent. Add minced garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Then add spices and stir until fragrant (about 30 more seconds).
3. Add broth or water. If you use water, add the bullion once it starts to heat up. Add lemon juice and zest. Bring it to a boil.
4. Once its boiling add orzo and chicken and bring to a boil and then cook until orzo is cooked (usually 15 minutes or however long package says)
5. Once its finished, add spinach and parsley. I added only a little in the bowl I was going to eat and saved the rest fresh. The recipes online said to add it all but I am storing this for later so Ill add the fresh greens as I eat it.

1. Pour the water into a pot and heat over medium high heat until boiling
2. Then pour in the sago and stir to ensure there are no clumps and none of the sago sticks to the bottom of the pot
3. Simmer for 15-20 minutes or until almost all of the sago balls are completely translucent throughout
4. Strain out the water from the sago and wash the sago pearls under cold water
5. Leave the sago pearls to sit in a bowl of cold water until the mango base has cooled and it is time to fill the donuts

Donuts

1. In a large bowl combine the wet ingredients (milk, egg yolks, and melted butter)
2. In a small bowl combine the dry ingredients (flour, yeast, sugar, baking powder, and salt)
3. Slowly add the dry ingredients from the small bowl, into the wet ingredients in the large bowl and mix until the dough is formed
4. Continue to knead the dough for another 10 minutes or until it is no longer sticky (this is a pretty wet dough, but if after 10 minutes the dough is too sticky to touch, add an additional 1/4 cup of flour)
5. Transfer the dough to a well oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap
6. Allow the dough to proof for \~1 hour or until doubled in size
7. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll until about 1/2 inch thick
8. Cut out 4 inch rounds from the dough and place on a lined baking tray
9. Once all the rounds are cut, cover the baking tray with plastic wrap and allow to proof again for 30 minutes
10. Pour vegetable oil into a pot (enough to reach about 3 inches from the bottom of the pot) and heat to 350F
11. Once the donut rounds are done proofing, fry each donut, two at a time, in the hot oil. \~1-2 minutes each side or until golden brown
12. Once the donuts are done frying and are still hot, roll the donuts in some granulated or powdered sugar if desired
13. Allow the donuts to cool completely before attempting to fill

Assembly

1. Once the donuts and mango base are cool, remove the mango base from the fridge and pour in the sago (strained out of the cold water) and mix to combine
2. Fill a piping bag with the mango sago mixture
3. Take a donut, cut a small hole into the middle of it, and pipe in the mango sago filling
4. Repeat for all the donuts

1 tsp Garlic powder

1 tsp Cajun spices

1 tsp Mixed herbs

2 pinches Salt and pepper

Instructions

Mix your two bowls separately in preparation for frying. One bowl should contain the batter mix, the other should be the same but without the added milk.

Individually dip the mushrooms into the batter mix and then into the flour mix, making sure the mushroom is completely coated. Set aside until all the mushrooms are coated and ready for frying.

In a deep pan (we use a wide base iron skillet), heat the oil on a high heat. When boiling, fry the mushrooms in small batches and turn every couple of minutes with tongs. Keep turning for roughly 8-10 minutes until golden brown.

Set aside to cool and set on some paper towels to soak up some of the extra moisture otherwise it may be too saturated still with oil.

2020-10-12,39,"Chinese Braised Pork Belly (Hong Shao Rou)","poor_coIIege_student","This is one of the tastiest Chinese dishes of all time! 

### INGREDIENTS

* 1.5 pounds thick pork belly (about 1.5 inches wide; skin on)
* 3 cups water
* 2 cloves garlic (crushed)
* 1/2 inch ginger (sliced thin)
* 2 star anise
* 10 Szechuan peppercorn (optional if cant find at grocery store)
* 1/2 cinnamon stick
* 2 tablespoons cooking oil
* 7 tablespoons brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 4 tablespoons dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)

### DIRECTIONS

* In a wide pot or pan, add the three cups of water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat (the water level should be at least half the thickness of the pork belly). Add the pork belly and parboil for a minute on each side, just until the exterior is a bit firm. Remove the pork belly to a cutting board, and set the hot water aside (dont pour it out!)
* Add the garlic, ginger, star anise, Szechuan peppercorn, and cinnamon stick to the water and keep over low heat (we need this water to be hot since we will be adding it back to the pork and if it gets cold then it might cause the meat to toughen up)
* Cut the pork belly into cubes about 1.5 inches on each side
* In a Dutch oven or large pot, start heating up the oil over medium-low heat. Add 3.5 tablespoons of the brown sugar. Let the sugar sit undisturbed until you see it start to melt. Once it starts melting, you can use a single chopstick to mix it up a bit to speed up the melting process
* When all the sugar has melted and turned into a dark amber color, add the pork belly. Cook while flipping the pieces for a few minutes until almost every side of each piece is covered with the caramel. Be gentle so you dont break the pieces!
* Add the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine and cook for a minute. Then add the water with all the spices and aromatics. Braise the pork belly over medium-low heat for 2 hours, stirring once every 30 minutes
* After 2 hours, the pork should be fully tender. You can check by sticking a chopstick into the meat through the bottom. The chopstick should be able to easily pierce the entire piece. If you want it to be more tender, put the lid back on and keep braising until it reaches your desired tenderness
* Remove the lid and raise the heat to medium. Add the remaining 3.5 tablespoons of sugar and mix. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the sauce has reduced significantly and thickened up. Stir every few minutes to prevent the meat from burning. Youll know its done when the sauce is thick enough to start sticking to the meat
* Remove the meat from the pot and then drizzle with some of the extra sauce. Serve hot with a side of rice and vegetables

2020-10-12,3,"My Red Curry With Tofu","Zentij","Thanks to the clout on my brother's post on /r/FoodPorn, I'm obliged to share this recipe.

My recipe varies depending on desired consistency and spice level, but for this one I used:

14 or 16 oz package extra firm Tofu

4oz red curry paste

5-6 kaffir lime leaf

1 inch minced ginger

1-2 bulbs minced garlic

About 750ml coconut milk

2 cups broth (Use 1 cup if you want it extra spicy)

2-3 Tbsp fish sauce

2 Tbsp palm sugar

About 2 cups yardlong beans

4oz canned bamboo shoots

1 red bell pepper

1 green bell pepper

Handful of basil (I used Taiwanese this time)

Spur chili for garnish (its not spicy)

**Instructions:**

I don't really measure times, so time are approximate

&amp;#x200B;

1. Slice bell peppers and cut in half. Cut yardlong beans into 1-2 inch slices. Or cut them however you want.
2. Drain tofu package, set it on a paper towel lined plate. Put more towels on top and place another plate on top to press out more moisture. Cut it however you want it. Over medium high heat, fry until browned to preference and slightly crispy on the outside (Its fine to just fry two sides.
3. Add 250 ml of coconut milk to a medium high heat pot or nonstick wok (what I used), cook down until fat starts to separate. Then mix in ginger, garlic, and curry paste. Then add tofu and coat in curry mixture.
4. Tear and add kaffir lime leaves, then add another 250 ml coconut milk, add palm sugar and 2 Tbsp fish sauce. Let simmer for about 8 minutes.
5. Add yardlong beans, and bell peppers. Cook until vegetables start to soften. Add remaining coconut milk and broth. Let simmer some more until you reach desired consistency of curry and vegetables. Add bamboo shoots, and a handful of basil. Taste, and season with fish sauce to taste.

Comments/tips:

Curry should be slightly salty/over-flavorful as rice will dilute the sauce.

Use plenty of paper towels as tofu carries a lot of moisture.

I've thought of using another 250ml of coconut milk and just 1 cup of broth to thicken this recipe up and keep it at a manageable spice level for my family. If anyone tries it, let me know how it goes!",2109

- 2 pounds of skirt steak or flank steak
- Flakey salt and black pepper for grilling

CHIMICHURRI SAUCE:
- 1/2 cup of olive oil
- 1/3 cup of red wine vingear
- About 1 cup of fresh parsley, chopped (rough estimate)
- About 1 cup of fresh cilantro, chopped (rough estimate)
- 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes
- 1 tablespoon of minced garlic
- Flakey salt to taste

STEAK MARINADE/ CITRUS MARINADE:
- 1 cup of fresh squeezed orange juice
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons of minced garlic
- 1 cup thinly sliced onions
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano 
- 1 teaspoon of cumin

INSTRUCTIONS:
Prepare marinade and pour into a gallon bag. Add churrasco and let it marinate for 4 hours or overnight. While they rest, prepare the chimichurri sauce. A traditional chimichurri sauce is prepared by finely chopping fresh herbs, so do not use a food processor. The chimichurri sauce should resemble a loose oil-based condiment not a paste. 

When ready to grill, season the churrasco with flakey salt and black pepper, then cook on high heat, for 3 - 4 minutes on each side or until preferred doneness. I recommended cooking to medium or medium well. Once cooked, rest the churrasco for 10 minutes and slice aganist the grain. This will keep your skirt steak tender and juicy.

You can use any other squash like Butternut, Acorn, Crown prince, Carnival and super sweet Japanese Kabocha. They will give you slightly different results but this is the fun in cooking and experimentation!

Ambercup Squash puree incorporates to the cheesy bechamel adding another layer of creaminess and nutty notes of flavour. Crunchy seeds and panko breadcrumbs breakthrough delicacy of the sauce making it more fulfilling. The recipe can be baked or eaten once pasta gets mixed with the bechamel depending on your preference.

2020-10-10,3,"How to make stuffed pumpkin","My-k0","INGREDIENTS :

-pumpkin
-cream
-cheese
-old bread 
-onion
-lard (bacon ???)

RECIPE :

Cut your onion and lard, put them in a small pan without any fat and add salt, black pepper and nutmeg. When cooked put them in a bowl. 

Add cream, your bread cut in bit size pieces and your grated cheese, mix well.

Cut the top of the pumpkin and put away the seeds. Stuff your pumpkin with the mixture you just made (put the top back) and place it in the oven at 180°C or lower for minimum 1h30.
It's cooked when the flesh is soft.

OTHER :

You can reserve the seed and make roasted seed, you just need to clean them, add salt and whatever spice you like (I like to put paprika and cinnamon), then put them on a baking tray in your oven at high temperature (or grill mode) until crispy.",777
2020-10-10,1,"Quick Turnip Greens","CapnJacksPharoah","I like greens but I dont have the smoked meats (turkey neck, ham hock, etc.) that many recipes call for, so I experimented with alternatives and wound up with the recipe below.You can substitute diced ham for the salt pork if you want to - hope you enjoy it!

INGREDIENTS:

1 package (14 oz) frozen turnip greens (the brand I used includes some chopped turnip)

6 oz sliced salt pork (half of a 12 oz package)

2 medium yellow onion (or 1 large and 1 small, 2-3 cup chopped)

4 cloves garlic or 2 tsp pre-minced

1 cup vegetable stock

Water

3 tsp apple cider vinegar

¼ tsp black pepper

Cayenne pepper to taste

Salt to taste

Vegetable oil

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Halve, peel and finely chop (\~1/4 inch) the onions
2. Peel and mince the garlic
3. Cut the sliced salt pork into ¼ to ½ inch pieces
4. In a medium to large pot, heat a splash of vegetable oil over medium high heat, then saute the salt pork until the fat is rendered and the pork is getting a little crispy; remove the meat and pour out the fat (see notes below).
5. Heat a splash of vegetable oil in in the same pot over medium high heat, then cook the garlic, stirring constantly, until fragrant  around 30 seconds.
6. Add the onion and cook until it starts to soften.
7. Add the vegetable stock, frozen turnip greens, and cooked salt pork to the pot.
8. Let the greens thaw enough to remove any lumps, then add just enough water to cover.
9. Add the apple cider vinegar.
10. Add the ground black pepper and a couple shakes of cayenne pepper (if desired).
11. Stir everything together and bring to a boil, then cover and reduce the heat to simmer.
12. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
13. Remove from heat, spoon greens with some of the liquid into a bowl and serve with pepper vinegar. Add a little salt to taste  I find that the vegetable stock and salt pork bring enough salt to the recipe.
14. Add a piece of jalapeño cornbread (search Bernard Clayton jalapeño cornbread recipe) for a perfect accompaniment. 

NOTES:

1. If you are not on a low saturated fat diet (which I am) you can cook the salt pork in the cooking pot, remove the cooked meat to a bowl and use the drippings to cook the garlic and onions.  I sacrificed a good bit of flavor by cooking in a separate pan and leaving the drippings behind.
2. The Bernard Clayton jalapeno cornbread recipe uses creamed corn, shredded cheese, and grated onion to make a moist and tasty cornbread.  I happen to have the source book (Bernard Claytons New Complete Book of Breads) and have made this cornbread  found the recipe on blogspot but not allowed to link to it. 

Edit: tried to fix the cornbread recipe link - removed after finding out that blogspot is not allowed. Updated notes accordingly.",2734

2020-10-07,5,"I made Calzone!","zippopwnage","Calzone? Seinfeld? 
Hey I'm George again, and today I'm making my first Calzones! And not only that, but I'm trying the fillings from Seinfeld. (In a way)
I made pizza before but not Calzones. I think the hardest part was to seal them. 

Recipe for the dough : 

 - 650g flour
 - 7g dried yeast
 - salt
 - 25-30ml olive oil
 -325 ml of warm water
 - pinch of sugar for the water and yeast.
 - I also added 25 ml more of water later after some kneading. 
 - Cooked at 180 degree Celsius until golden brown
 - Butter to brush after is done

Filling :

 - (For the Seinfeld one) Eggplant, Ricotta Cheese, Mozzarella, Pepperoni
For my own fillings (I made more than 1)
 - (Precooked) : Bacon, Onion, Kapia Peppers, Eggplant
 - Mushrooms, Salami, Pepperoni, Mozzarella, Smoked Cheese, Tomato Sauce with Basil.

If you have any questions..please ask. I'm more than happy to answer or talk about this recipe (Or any recipe tbh).

Procedure :

 - Add the flour into a bowl. Add the yeast into the warm water with a pinch of sugar and mix it together.
 - Let it sit for 5 minutes. 
 - Cut the eggplant in slices, and salt both sides. Let it sit for 20-30 minutes to release the bitter water, that you will have to wipe off with a napkin.
 - Now put the water with the yeast into the flour. Mix with a wooden spoon or your dough mixer. I personally only used 1 bowl with 1 wooden spoon.
 - Mix until everything almost combine. Then use your hand. At this time it should not be super sticky and is gonna be easy to kneed.
 - After mixing with your hand for 2-5 minutes, if everything's too dry, add 25 ml of water more (I needed to add). 
 - Now mix a little more, until the dough is not sticky anymore. Mine was not sticky at all. When you press it with your finger it should not stick to it.
 - Let it rest for at least 1 hour
Now you can precook some of the ingredients. 
 - After wiping the eggplant, put some oil on it, and put it in the oven at 180 degree celsius for 30-ish minutes.
 - Get the kapia/redbell pepper and an onion and cook it in a pan with a little oil + some butter until the onion is translucent and the kapia/bellpepper is soft. 
 - Add salt and pepper
 - Bacon, you cook it in the oven on a cooking rack until crisp. 

Now the hardest part (at least for me) shaping the Calzone. I cut my dough in 8 small/medium calzone's. You can cut yours how you want.
You need to shape the dough in an oval shape. (For me shaping the dough is really hard)
After that, don't overfill your Calzone, otherwise you will have problems sealing it. For the Seinfield one, you need to add Cheese, Pepperoni and Eggplant. 
For the rest, fill them as you'd like. I suggest starting with a layer of Tomato Sauce or Ricotta Cheese. After that, use whatever your hearth tells you.
You need to cover the filling with a part of the dough, and shape it. To seal it, I did a twist in the back corners, and the rest I rotate it and pinch it. 
You can mix some water with flour into a small bowl and use that as a ""glue"", but you still have to pinch it.

Now cook it at 180 degree Celsius until golden brown. When you get them out of the oven, have some melted butter to brush on top of them.

Enjoy!

Whenever I go to a Korean restaurant that serves them, I always end up asking for refills because they're so addicting! In this recipe I added gochugaru (red pepper powder) to give it some heat.

* 2 tbsp neutral oil (ex. canola)
* 1 tbsp gochugaru (red pepper powder)

Instructions:

1. Peel two potatoes, cut into cubes, wash them and soak them in water. This is to remove some starch and prevent the dish from being mushy.
2. Combine minced garlic, soy sauce, rice syrup/honey, neutral oil, and gochugaru.
3. Drain and saute the potatoes with some oil over medium heat, until a translucent skin forms. This will help create a chewier texture.

###**Garlic Cream Pasta :**

###**Ingredients**:

* Penne Pasta - 200 gram (uncooked)
* Milk - 200-250 ml
* Butter - 10 gram
* Olive Oil - 1 tbsp
* Garlic - 4 tbsp (minced)
* All purpose flour - 1 tbsp
* Salt as per taste
* Black pepper as per taste
* Cheese (optional)
* Oregano (optional)
* Coriander Leaves (cilantro)

###**Directions**:

Step 1) Add butter and oil to a pan.

Step 2) Add minced garlic in butter and oil and let it cook until raw aroma of Garlic goes away.

Step 3) Cool it down and blend the garlic with some water. You can either blend it super smooth or leave it a bit chunky as per your preference.

Step 4) While the garlic is cooling down, boil the penne pasta al dente. Drain off the water and wash them under running water to stop cooking and spread them in a plate.

**Note : Always boil the pasta as per the package instructions. There should be a bite in the pasta.**

**Note: Don't rub oil on the pasta as while doing that prevents them from sticking, oil rubbed pasta doesn't hold sauce that well. So, just cool the pasta under running water and spread them on a plate. This will ensure that your pasta doesn't stick to each other while they'll also hold the sauce well.**

Step 5) Add garlic in the same pan and add all purpose flour. Roast it on low flame until you get a nutty smell.

Step 6) Add salt and pepper.

Step 7) Add milk and bring it to a boil.

Step 8) (Optional) Grate cheese into the milk and sprinkle some oregano to it.

Step 9) Let the cheese melt and thicken the milk. You'll notice that milk will soon reduce in quantity.

Step 10) Now add boiled penne pasta and coat it with sauce.

Step 11) Since pasta is undercooked, it'll absorb the sauce and cook completely.

Step 12) Turn off the flame and add coriander leaves.

Your creamy garlicky pasta is ready.

My favorite Malaysian dish is satay ayam, or Malaysian-style chicken satay skewers! Served with a spicy, aromatic, umami peanut sauce, satay ayam is so lip-smackingly good that there are never leftovers at the table when its served! Who could NOT love the combination of aromatics such as lemongrass, galangal, garlic, shallots, and more?! 

This recipe is no joke: Malaysian chicken satay with peanut sauce is truly a labor of love, as theres lots of chopping, pounding, grinding, and grilling/pan-frying, but trust me, the effort is worth it: Each bite is an explosion of flavors in your mouth, and anyone who tries this will be hankering for more!**To watch this recipe in action**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A4p2Va6tJk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A4p2Va6tJk)

3. When ready, thread 3-4 pieces of the chicken meat onto soaked bamboo skewers.

1 1/2 cups (195 grams) all-purpose flour

3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar, plus 1 tablespoon for muffin tops

1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt

2 teaspoons baking powder

1/3 cup (80 ml) neutral-flavored oil; canola, vegetable and grape seed are great

1 large egg

1/3  1/2 cup (80 ml  120 ml) milk; dairy and non-dairy both work

1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

6 to 8 ounces fresh or frozen blueberries; see note below about frozen berries (about 1 cup)

## DIRECTIONS

* **PREPARE OVEN AND MUFFIN CUPS**

Heat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. For big-topped muffins, line 8 standard-size muffin cups with paper liners. For standard-size muffins line 10 muffin cups. Fill the remaining cups with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to help the muffins bake evenly.

* **MAKE BATTER**

Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.

Add oil to a measuring jug that holds at least 1 cup. Add the egg then fill the jug to the 1-cup line with milk (1/3 to 1/2 cup milk). Add vanilla and whisk to combine.

Add milk mixture to the bowl with dry ingredients then use a fork to combine. Do not over mix. (The muffin batter will be quite thick  see note below for more details). Fold in the blueberries.

* **BAKE MUFFINS**

Divide the batter between muffin cups. (If making big-topped muffins, the batter will come to the tops of the paper liners). Sprinkle a little sugar on top of each muffin.

Bake muffins 15 to 20 minutes or until tops are no longer wet and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out with crumbs, not wet batter. Transfer to a cooling rack.

To store, place them in a plastic bag, seal, and store at room temperature for 2 to 3 days. To freeze, wrap them tightly in aluminum foil or place them in freezer bags. Freeze for up to 3 months.",2004

- 2 teaspoons of Salt
- 1 teaspoon of  Black Pepper
- 1 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper
- 1 teaspoon of Paprika
- 1 teaspoon of Garlic Powder
- 1 teaspoon of Onion Powder
- 1 teaspoon of Red Pepper Flakes
- 1 teaspoon of Dried Oregano

LEMON BUTTER SAUCE
- 2 to 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter
- 1 lemon juiced
- 1 tablespoon of garlic paste 

INSTRUCTIONS:
Pick your desired cut of fish. I chose 6 oz of cod filets. Rinse them in white vinegar and lemon, to remove any fishy smell.

Apply your cajun/blackening seasoning (to your desired taste or level)and massage well. Set aside for 10 minutes for a quick marinade. Cajun seasoning recipe is large enough for 4-5 servings of fish. 

When ready, sear your filets on medium-high heat. Place the filet down &amp; don't move it. Allow it to build a crust (approx. for 4 minutes) then flip to other side. Splash some water into your pan and cover. The steam will finish cooking your filets, leaving them juicy and flaky. 

Remove filets and begin building your butter sauce in the same pan. Don't clean your pan before this step. Any leftover blackened bits will flavor your sauce. Deglaze your pan with butter, garlic and lemon juice. Whisk until your sauce is glossy. Season to taste and serve over your cod.

Pair your cod filets with your favorite side dish, I chose garlic mashed potatoes but creamy polenta or risotto would work too.

Enjoy!

Using miso paste with dashi in it, will change your life forever. Dont have to just use it in Asian inspired foods. Anyways heres: 

The Best Butternut Squash Soup Ever	

* 1 large butternut squash peeled and chopped	

* 2-3 medium red or russet potatoes chopped

3. Cover the aromatics with about half of 1 qt of chicken or veggie stock and bring to a soft boil. 

4. Once squash and potatoes are done, scrape everything into the pot then cover completely with the rest of the stock (add more or less depending on how thick you like it). 

5. Add the miso paste and lemon/lime. Take off the heat and blend directly in the pot with a stick blender.

Stuffed squash is a great healthy and simple way to kick off the fall cooking season! It's also a great way to use up leftovers. I happened to use some leftover chicken for the filling, but if you dont have that, any ground or shredded turkey or chicken can work as a substitute. The quinoa &amp; garlic was also leftover from the prior day, but that can be cooked as needed as well.

* 1 cup of shredded chicken (or cooked ground chicken)
* ½ cup cooked quinoa
* 2 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro
* S squeezed lemon juice
* ½ cup chopped walnuts
* 2 cloves of roasted garlic
* ½ cup blueberries
* 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* S cup chopped feta cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
2. Cut the squash in half, lengthwise, and oil both sides. Remove seeds from squash. Place it face down on a lined baking sheet and bake at 450 for 30 minutes.
3. In a bowl, mix all ingredients together except the feta cheese. Save a small amount of the cilantro for topping.
4. When squash is finished, scoop out a small cavity to make the hole larger, and combine scooped squash with the other ingredients.
5. Fill the squash halves and top with feta cheese.
6. Bake for 10 minutes at 450.

* Peanut Butter as required

###**Directions**-

1) Melt Dark Chocolate with oil over double boiler or in the microwave for 30 seconds.

3) Fill halfway through and refrigerate it for 15 minutes.

4) Take them out of the fridge and put peanut butter on top of the cups. You can use as much peanut butter as you like.

**Note : I like using unsweetened crunchy peanut butter but you can use smooth and sweet one as well.**

5) Cover peanut butter with melted chocolate and tap the cups again to level the Chocolate.

2020-10-01,35,"Pork Loin with Apples Recipe - A traditional way to make pork loin in Tuscany","italian_cook","ok let's start.  First thing you need a mortar &amp; pestle. my grandmother always said that if you cut the sage with a blade it will become more bitter so... mortar &amp; pestle :D

Ingredients: 

15 sage leaf ( normal sage leaf size 4/5 cm long.  you can fry the larger leaves if you want  but that is another recipe :D ) 

40 g parmigiano reggiano or grana ( not already grated cheese pls. the quality of the ingredients must be the first concern )

15 g almonds

1 garlic clove if you like

extra virgin olive oil

coarse salt a pinch

&amp;#x200B;

the preparation is like the genoese pesto so you put the salt and sage in the mortar and start to crush it, then a little of oil, crush again, then almonds ( the garlic if you like it )  and a little more oil, work with the pestle, and to finish parmigiano and more oil. The consistency must be creamy but firm. Adjust with salt.

At this point you can use it ( personally i prefer it with stuffed pasta like ravioli ricotta and spinach but other kind of pasta should be also be good)or put in a  glass jar cover the pesto with oil and use it in the winter \^\_\^ 

I hope this recipe could be useful and sorry if my english it's not great but honestly i haven't idea of the right translation for the work to do with the mortar :D",1284

### INGREDIENTS 

* 4-1/2 lb pork roast
* 3 Tbsp kosher sea salt
* 3 Tbsp granulated sugar
* 3 Tbsp neutral cooking oil
* 1 onion, cut into three pieces

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Prepare the Roast

* Dry the roast with a paper towel and, if necessary, trim excess fat with a sharp knife. 

#### Dry Rub

* Put the roast in a baking dish. 
* Mix salt and sugar in a bowl.
* Use your hands and rub the mixture evenly over the entire roast. 
* Cover with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for about 24 hours.

#### Cooking the Roast

* Preheat the oven to 300°F. 
* On the stove, heat 3 Tbsp neutral cooking oil in the Dutch oven.
* Brown roast evenly for 3 minutes on each side.
* Remove roast and place a large onion, cut in 3 pieces, on the bottom of the pan. Put the browned roast on top (the onions will act as a shelf and prevent the roast from sitting too deep in its own liquids). 
* Place the lid on the Dutch oven and stick it in the oven for 3 hours. 
* Carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven. Carefully, remove the hot lid from the Dutch oven. And now, very carefully lift out the pork roast and place it on a large cutting board, preferably one that has a juice groove.**Tip:** If youre not sure if your roast is ready, you can always use a meat thermometer and a fork. The meat thermometer should read 190°F and the fork should easily pull apart the meat. 
* Use a couple large forks and rip into it. The roast will fall apart effortlessly. Shred it with the forks to the fineness you like and enjoy any way you want (toss with BBQ sauce, mix together with juices and onions from the pan, etc). Definitely taste it just as it is first, though!",1904

In the article, you will even find an instructional video! :)

*To summarise:*

""Sambal"" is simply a type of hot relish or chilli paste. Traditionally, you would pound the chillies with a stone pestle and mortar on the floor. 

""Belacan"" is a shrimp paste comprising fermented dry krill with salt, and is an essential component in a lot of Malay or Indonesian cooking. 

Therefore, ""sambal belacan"" is a type of chilli paste with fermented shrimp added to it!

**What you'll need:**

* 10 to 15 fresh okras, *remove stem and cut into pieces*
* 3 chillies (I used 1 red chilli and 2 bird's eye chillies), *sliced thinly*
* 3 cloves garlic, *peeled and chopped*
* 1 tbsp (15g) dried shrimps, *washed and soaked for 10 minutes to soften before chopping*
* ¾ inch cube belacan (shrimp paste), *toasted*
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* A pinch of salt to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Rinse okra well .
2. Pound (or blend) chillies, garlic, dried shrimp, belacan with 2 tbsp of water into a pastethis is your **sambal belacan**.
3. In a large pan or wok, heat oil.
4. Saute sambal belacan mixture for 4 to 5 minutes until it is fragrant.
5. Add a pinch of salt.
6. Add 1/4 cup of water.
7. Add okra and fry on high heat for 2 to 3 minutes before vegetables are wilted; you still want that crunch!
8. Remove and serve immediately with steamed rice.

2020-09-29,9,"Banana bread with chocolate, caramelized walnuts and caramelized bananas","alikrex","# Recipe

## Ingredients for the batter:
- 125 g soft butter
- 120 g sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla sugar
- 2 eggs
- 4 ripe bananas (~400 g when peeled)
- 300 g AP flour 
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon 
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg 
- ~ 10 g baking powder (slightly more than half of a whole 16g packet)
- a pinch of salt 
- 60 g chocolate

## Method:
1. Mash peeled bananas into a puree.
2. Beat butter with sugar and vanilla sugar until fluffy. Mix in both eggs one by one. Beat until properly incorporated. 
3. Stir in the mashed bananas
4. Combine the dry ingredients, mix until homogeneous 
5. Using a spatula fold the dry mixture into the butter/Banana/egg mixture.
6. Now add chopped  chocolate,  caramelized walnuts,...
7. Butter and dust your pan with flour. Pour batter into pan. (I used a 25cm loaf pan and oil instead of butter, because it's easier to spread)
8. Bake in preheated oven (170°C)  for 70-80 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. 
9. Leave in pan for 10 min, then put the banana bread on a cooling rack. 
10. Enjoy! :)

## caramelized walnuts:
- 70 g walnuts (I chopped them, but You can leave them whole)
- 30 g sugar (might need more or less, I eyeballed it)

1. Roast the walnuts in a pan until they start to smell nice. Take them out of the pan
2. Pour sugar into pan. Melt sugar on high heat until it's golden brown. (You can add some water before melting the sugar to help it distribute more evenly)
3. Put walnuts back into pan. Mix until they are evenly coated with the melted sugar.
4. Spread them onto some parchment paper and put them into the fridge until they are solid.
5. Break them into little pieces and put those into banana bread. 

## caramelized bananas:
- 1/2 Banana cut into semi-circles
- 30 g sugar

Melt sugar, put bananas in,...(same as for walnuts)

The bananas didn't turn out crispy, but turned into something liken a fudge. Maybe frying them before putting them into the molten sugar could fix that.


With the caramelized walnuts and bananas I only used about 100g of sugar for the batter. 
I added the ""banana-fudge"" in between two layers of batter. You can kind of see the banana-fudge layer in the middle of the bread.",2164

2020-09-29,2,"Ive been cooking a lot in quarantine. My first time making eggplant parmesan!","iamthemarysue","I received a really beautiful big eggplant in my CSA box so I had to do something with it. :) This was a fun, all-day-leisurely-cooking kind of recipe; it's definitely time-intensive. But it came out beautifully: not mushy but soft with give, and there was no soggy moisture left in the pan! I basically followed [this](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-eggplant-parmesan) recipe but with a few adaptations due to what I had in my fridge/pantry and based on the comments, i.e. halving the ingredients and using way less eggplant.. I listed the changes below with the OG recipe by Claire Saffitz:

**MARINARA**

* ¼ cup olive oil
* 1 head of garlic, cloves crushed
* 1 large red onion, chopped
* 3 oil-packed anchovy fillets
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* ¼ cup cooking sherry (used instead of white wine)
* 1 28-ounce cans whole peeled tomatoes (I used San Marzano)
* 2 teaspoons-ish dried basil (the grocery store was out of fresh!!!)
* ½ teaspoon dried oregano
* Kosher salt

Preheat oven to 350°. Heat oil in a large heavy ovenproof pot over medium. Cook garlic until golden and fragrant. Add onion, anchovies, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring often, until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until slightly darkened, about 2 minutes. Add cooking sherry, bring to a boil, and cook until almost completely evaporated, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, breaking up with your hands, and their juices; add basil and oregano and stir to combine. Swirl 1½ cups water into the large tomato can, to rinse, and add to pot; season with salt. Transfer pot to oven; roast sauce, stirring halfway through, until thick and tomatoes are browned on top and around edges of pot, 22½ hours.

Let sauce cool slightly. Pass through the large holes of a food mill or process in a food processor until mostly smooth. Taste and season with salt.

**EGGPLANT PARMESAN**

* 1 big eggplant, sliced into rounds about 1/2 inch thick
* Kosher salt
* 3 cups panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
* 1½ teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1½ cups finely grated Parmesan, divided
* 1½ cups all-purpose flour
* 3 large eggs, beaten to blend
* 1S cups olive oil
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* 1 teaspoon dried parsley
* 6 ounces low-moisture mozzarella, grated (about 1S cups)
* 8 ounces fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced

Lightly season eggplant slices all over with salt; place in a single layer on several layers of paper towels inside a rimmed baking sheet. Top with another layer of paper towels and more slices; repeat as needed. Top with a final layer of paper towels, then another rimmed baking sheet; weigh down with a heavy pot. Let eggplant sit until it has released excess liquid, 4560 minutes. This step gives the eggplant a creamy texture when baked.

Meanwhile, pulse panko, oregano, pepper, and ¾ cup Parmesan in a food processor until very finely ground. Transfer to a shallow bowl.

Preheat oven to 350°. Place flour in another shallow bowl and eggs in a third shallow bowl. Working one at a time, dredge eggplant slices in flour, then dip in egg, allowing excess to drip off. Coat in breadcrumbs, packing all around, then shaking off excess. Place on wire racks.

Heat T cup oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook as many eggplant slices as will comfortably fit in pan, turning once, until deep golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels and immediately press with more paper towel to absorb oil. Working in batches, repeat with remaining slices, adding remaining T cup oil and wiping out skillet as needed. Let cool. Taste and season with more salt if needed.

Toss basil, oregano, low-moisture mozzarella, and remaining ¾ cup Parmesan in a medium bowl. Spread 1 cup sauce over the bottom of a 13x9"" baking pan; top with a layer of eggplant slices (trim as needed). Drizzle 1 cup sauce over and sprinkle with one-third of cheese mixture. Add another layer of eggplant, followed by 1 cup sauce and half of remaining cheese mixture. Repeat layers with remaining slices, sauce, and cheese mixture. Cover with foil and bake on a rimmed baking sheet until eggplant is custardy, 4560 minutes.

Remove from oven and arrange fresh mozzarella over eggplant. Increase oven temperature to 425° and bake, uncovered, until cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, 1520 minutes longer. Let rest 30 minutes. Top with basil leaves just before slicing.",4480

    3 cups flour
    1 diced onion
    1 cup chopped celery
    1 chopped green bell pepper
    1/2 a stick of butter
    6 diced garlic cloves
    1 tbsp white pepper
    1 tsp cayanne
    3 tbsp paprika
    1 tsp sugar
    1 tsp black pepper
    3 quarts chicken stock (If you use low sodium stock you'll have to add salt to taste later)
    2 quarts water
    1 whole chicken 
    1/2 pound Andouille sausage
    1/2 pound smoked sausage
    2-3 bay leaf
    1 tsp kitchen bouquet
    1 tbsp smoked chipotle tobasco (that's my favorite anyway)
    1 cup diced green onion tops 

#Prep time

About 5 hours, really. I'm sure someone more efficient than me could get it down to 2 or 3. 

#Instructions

#""First you make a roux..."" 

A dark roux of vegetable oil and flour, cooked on medium-high heat in a cast iron skillet for ~30 minutes (or longer if it isn't dark brown yet). We're going for a **dark** roux here. Past chocolate colored. You have to stir it *constantly* with a metal whisk or wooden spoon. Your arm will be tired. Push through. Don't let that roux burn or you will have to start over, and it burns very easily.

Add your 

    3 cups oil
to the cast iron and get it hot, then gradually stir in

    3 cups flour

Some folks will say it should be equal parts flour and oil by *weight* rather than volume. Feel free to try it that way. 

Keep stirring until it has a nice deep brown color. Some smoke is ok, but it shouldn't be setting off detectors. The consistency should be smooth. 

Take the roux off the heat but **don't stop stirring**. The pan is still hot, the roux is still cooking, it can still burn. Stir for another 5 minutes or so. It will get even darker. Then set it aside to cool to room temp.

Then you take

    3-4 cups of ""the trinity"":
        1 diced onion
        1 cup chopped celery
        1 chopped green bell pepper  
    6 diced garlic cloves
    1/2 a stick of butter

and stir fry them in the bottom of your gumbo pot until the onions are clear. (Another option is to toss them in the hot roux to stop it from continuing to cook/burn, and to cook the trinity in the roux before transferring it all to your gumbo pot. Just make sure you either slowly add *cold roux to hot liquid* **OR** *cold liquid to hot roux*. If you do hot-to-hot or cold-to-cold the roux will separate, and instead of a nice thick gumbo, you end up with an oily soup with bits of burned flour floating around, not nearly as appetizing.)

Then add the following spices to the trinity in the gumbo pot:

    1 tbsp white pepper
    1 tsp cayanne
    3 tbsp paprika
    1 tsp sugar
    1 tsp black pepper

and stir it around into a paste for 1-2 minutes on medium heat. Then add

    3 quarts chicken stock
    2 quarts water

and let it come to a boil.

While that is still coming to a boil, you get the meat ready. Take

     1 whole chicken 

and strip the skin off (leaving it on makes it a little too greasy) and of course remove any gizzard or other organs, and chop up

    1/2 pound Andouille sausage
    1/2 pound smoked sausage

And brown them in your nonstick pan. I don't know why, but having 2 kinds of sausage really seems to make a difference. 

When the water is at a low boil, add 

    2-3 bay leaf

And by now the roux you made is cooled off, so you can slowly, scoop by scoop, stir in

    The roux (Obviously if you tossed the veggies into the roux to stop it cooking earlier, you don't add it here.)

Now add in your whole skinless chicken and sliced sausage to the low boil.

Leave it simmering for 45 minutes. If you boil it too hard, the roux can separate. 

Then scoop the whole chicken out and strip off the meat (which should fall right off the bone). Put the meat back in, add

    1 tsp kitchen bouquet
    1 tbsp smoked chipotle tobasco (that's my favorite anyway)
    1 cup diced green onion tops 

boil low for another 5 minutes, then chill it until the next day when you want to serve it. At this point, the grease should all be at the top, and you can carefully laddle it out. You will probably have about a quarter inch thick layer of grease to remove, the topmost part of which will have hardened and you can remove pretty easily.

#To Serve

Heat up what you want on the stove and serve over white rice. Some people add a pinch of gumbo filé as well to their bowl, but *use it sparingly* since the gumbo will get a slimy texture if you add too much filé, and I usually splash it with some more Tobasco.",5163
2020-09-29,20,"Indian Food","Testher75","Thank you for saying this. Even in India, being an Indian, I've found many restaurants use almost the same ""masala"" for recipes with varying names - vegetarian &amp; non-veg both. Same goes for many ""desi Chinese"" recipes too! I think they compromise on flavour trying to cut costs and serve food faster. Please note that the way these spices are used in the recipe makes a significant change in flavour too. But, I assure you, a good restaurant will serve you dishes with varying flavours.

Also, it could be that you haven't yet developed a taste for the base spices - cumin, ginger, garlic, turmeric, etc. The use of ""garam masala"" has roots in dealing with the hot climate. 

They are quite strong flavours for someone from Europe or Northern America. For example, I love the light flavour of ""continental"" dishes that use only a seasoning of herbs, but many in India don't - or they do but they sabotage it with tomato/chilly sauces and pepper powder.",956

## INGREDIENTS

## Apple Pie Crust

* 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp granulated sugar
* 1 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into pea-sized pieces
* Ice water
* Extra butter for greasing pie pan
* 1 egg
* splash cream
* coarse sugar

## Apple Pie Filling

* 6 to 7 apples, peeled, cored, and sliced
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup flour
* 4 Tbsp unsalted butter
* 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg

## Apple Pie Topping

* 1 large egg
* Splash of cream
* Coarse sugar

## INSTRUCTIONS

## Apple Pie Crust Recipe

* To begin, simply mix together the flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor. 
* Next, add in the cold pieces of butter and briefly pulse a few times to mix them in, just until theyre covered with the flour mixture. 
* Lastly, gradually add the ice water, 1 Tbsp at a time until it all starts to stick together without crumbling apart. 
* Separate the dough into 2 equal balls. Wrap each ball in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for up to an hour.

## Apple Pie Filling Recipe

* Place apple slices in a bowl and toss with sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
* Toss everything together with your hands
* At this point, preheat your oven to 425	.

## Rolling Out the Dough

* Take the dough out of the fridge after about 45 minutes. 
* On a lightly floured surface, working quickly, roll out one at a time and leave the other ball in the fridge, so the butter in the dough doesnt get too warm in the meantime. 

## Putting It All Together

* Place the bottom crust in a lightly greased pie pan and dump all that apple-y goodness inside.
* Place a few pats of butter on top of it all and then your top crust goes on top. Slice a few steam vents on top and create whatever artistic edge youd like on your pie crust.
* Brush the top with an egg wash (beat one egg and a splash of cream and brush it all over the top crust). 
* The final step is to cover the top of the pie with a *crazy* amount of coarse sugar, which you can find at a bulk spice store.
* Bake your apple pie for 40 to 50 minutes or until it smells so delicious you cant take it anymore&the nose knows!
* Serve with ice cream or homemade whipped cream.",2415

The end result color can vary between an insipid yellow to a toasty beautiful brown. The whole process takes about 45 min so its not like the humidity or temperature has fluctuated.

The Garash cake is a hazelnut cake without flour. The recipe was created in 1885,  Ruse by pastry cook Kosta Garash. Garash cake is very popular and truly loved in Bulgaria. Here is the recipe I use:
 
**EQUIPMENT**  
* metal ring 

**INGREDIENTS**


*For 4 walnut cake layers*
* 250 g of raw walnuts
* 6-7 proteins
* 1 full tsp. powdered sugar / 130 g /
* 1 tbsp. flour / 15 g /
 
*For the cream*
* 250 g natural chocolate / couverture /
* 200 ml milk / vegetable / cream
* 1 incomplete tsp sugar / 75 g /
 
*For the glaze*
* 100 g of natural chocolate
* 1 tbsp. oil
* 30 g raw / roasted / pistachios for decoration
 

 
**INSTRUCTIONS**

*The Layers:*

In  a dry bowl, beat the egg whites, which should  B.C.be at room temperature, and when they become foamy, gradually add the powdered sugar. It breaks until it becomes fluffy snow.
Grind walnuts powder, along with 1 tbsp. crystal sugar so as not to become a puree. Transfer to the egg whites and mix gently with a spatula.
Sprinkle with flour and mix well. We take a tray with baking paper on the bottom. On it we put a metal ring with a diameter of 22 cm, in which we transfer 1/4 of the products for bread. Spread well and place in the middle of a preheated oven.
Bake at 150 degrees for 20 minutes. In the same way, shape and bake the rest of the dough so as to obtain a total of 4 cake layers. Wait for them to cool completely.
 
*The cream:*

Put pieces of natural chocolate in a saucepan. Melt in a water bath / should not exceed 50 degrees / or in a microwave oven. stir periodically until the pieces melt. Let it cool slightly.
In a separate saucepan pour the cream. Add sugar and heat the mixture to melt the sugar.
Add the cream to the slightly cooled chocolate, stirring constantly with a silicone spatula.
 
Once a homogeneous mixture is obtained, beat with a mixer, on low for two or three minutes. In a cake form with a detachable bottom and a diameter of 22 cm, the first layer is placed and spread with a little cream, alternating layer, cream, layer as the top is covered with cream. Remove the ring and spread the side edging.

*The Glaze*

Melt chocolate in a microwave oven at 500-600 watts for about 2 minutes. Pour oil and mix well. Pour the cake on all sides and let the icing harden.
At the very end, sprinkle with crushed pistachios. Put the cake in the refrigerator for a few hours to harden, cut into pieces and serve.

Check out the channel as well, lots of amazing recipes!

Recipe:

* Mung Bean Starch (100 grams)
* Water (950 grams)
* Bao Bei Chili Oil (4 tbl)
* Black Vinegar (2 tbl)
* Soy Sauce (2 tbl)
* Sesame Oil (a touch)
* Sugar (a pinch)
* Sichuan Peppercorn (a pinch)
* Garlic (2 cloves)
* Toppings: A handful of Cilantro, Scallions, Peanuts

&amp;#x200B;

1. Mix Starch with 200 grams of water. Heat up some water (750 grams) until you see small bubbles form but not yet boiling. Pour in the starch mixture while stirring, keep the heat on a medium until you feel it start to thicken, then put the heat to the lowest. Keep on stirring until it becomes a bit transparent and thick.
2. Pour into a tray and let it cool down, then fridge it for 2 hour minimum. Take out of fridge and cut into noodle size pieces. Wet the knife while doing so to prevent sticking.
3. Mix the sauce using all ingredients and set aside. For the toppings, dice the cilantro and scallions. Roast peanuts if needed and then crush with a hammer into small bits.
4. Assemble the noodles pouring on your desired amount of sauce and adding on toppings. You can also dilute the sauce a bit with water if you want a more liquid consistency.

2020-09-26,28,"Hazelnut maple madeleines","sweetchild-o-wine","**Ingredients**

* For greasing each pan: ½ tablespoon melted butter, 1 teaspoon all purpose flour
* 90g (¾ cup) all purpose flour
* 50g (½ cup) finely ground hazelnut
* ¾ tsp baking powder
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 2 eggs, room temperature
* 90g (½ cup) caster sugar
* 45g (3 tablespoon) milk
* 25g (2½ tablespoon) maple syrup
* 145g (T cup / 11 tablespoons) unsalted butter, browned and kept warm

**Directions**

1. Grease a 12-hole madeleine tray with melted butter and lightly flour pan with all-purpose flour. Tip pan over sink and tap side of pan to knock out extra flour.
2. In a medium bowl, sift all purpose flour, ground hazelnut, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
3. Brown butter in a saucepan until it smells nutty and has turned amber. Set aside.
4. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar with an electric whisk, for about 5 minutes on medium-high speed until the mixture is pale, thick and doubled in volume.
5. Fold the flour mixture from step #2 into the egg mixture from step #4. Add milk and maple syrup and mix.
6. Pour warm brown butter and mix until fully incorporated.
7. Spoon half the batter into the prepared madeleine tray (each hole should be half-full). Cover with cling film and refrigerate overnight. Transfer remaining madeleine batter into a container and cover batter with cling film, pressing to the top of the batter to prevent batter drying out.
8. The next day, preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F). Bake madeleines for 10 minutes until lightly golden and firm to touch.
9. Remove from oven and leave to cool for 5 minutes before gently removing from pan (I find using a fork or small offset spatula really helpful).

# Instructions
1. [Tuna Kimchi Rice Ball] - Combine the tuna, kimchi, mayo, and 1/4 of your sliced green onions. Mix well.
2. In a large bowl with about 2 cups of white rice, add a drizzle of sesame oil, 1 tsp of salt, and a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds. Mix well.
3. Take a handful of rice and flatten it in your palm. Add a couple of spoons of the tuna kimchi mixture and wrap the rice around the filling. Press firmly so that it holds together.
4. In a large mixing bowl, Add the Korean seasoned seaweed and crush it into small flakes. Add a rice ball to the seaweed and mix to coat. Continue with the rest of the rice balls and serve.
5. [Bacon Kimchi Rice Ball] - Cook your bacon in a pan until it begins to brown slightly. Add the kimchi and continue to cook until most of the excess moisture has evaporated.
6. Add the mixture to 2 cups of white rice, along with sliced green onions and mix to combine, being careful not to mash the rice. 
7. Squeeze firmly into balls and serve immediately.
8. [Bulgogi Rice Ball] - Combine ground beef, half the garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, and sugar in a bowl and mix well. Allow to marinate for 10 minutes.
9. Heat a pan over medium heat and add in the carrots. Cook for 3 minutes. Add in the onions and cook for another 2 minutes.
10. Add in the marinated beef and cook until the meat is completely cooked through, about 5 - 6 minutes.
11. In a large bowl with about 2 cups of white rice, add the bulgogi mixture, along with sliced green onions and the rest of the crushed seaweed flakes. Mix gently to combine.
12. Roll the rice mixture into balls and squeeze firmly. Serve immediately.
13. [Rolled Egg Rice Ball] - Heat a pan over medium heat and add oil. Cook minced carrots for 3 minutes. Add in minced garlic and cook for another minute.
14. Add in sliced spinach and cook for another minute. Add in toasted sesame seeds and mix well.
15. In a large bowl with about 1 cup of white rice, add the vegetable mix along with salt, and mix gently. Taste and readjust seasonings.
16. Grab a small handful of rice and shape it into an oval. Continue with the rest of the rice.
17. Beat the eggs well in a bowl with soy sauce and sugar.
18. Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Lay a strip of nori seaweed down onto the pan and hold the ends down until it lays flat on the pan.
19. Gently pour a spoonful of the egg mixture onto the pan. This works best if you only use the very liquid parts of the egg, rather than trying to use the mixed egg whites.
20. Once you pour the egg mixture onto the pan, use the underside of the spoon to """"paint"""" the egg across the seaweed strip. Add and shape the egg so it creates a large rectangle around the seaweed.
21. While the top of the egg is still uncooked, add one of the ovals of rice to the end of the egg, then using a pair of tongs and a spatula, gently roll the rice and egg towards the other end of the omelette.""",4275
2020-09-25,13,"Lemon Blueberry Poke Cake","neatoburrito___","Followed [this recipe](https://beyondfrosting.com/lemon-blueberry-poke-cake/) almost exactly except I used lemon and vanilla extract instead of lemon zest in the mascarpone whipped cream topping, as well as adding some lemon slices and homegrown rosemary for garnish.

INGREDIENTS

For the cake:

- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 3 large eggs
- 2 lemons, zested
- 1 teaspoon lemon extract, or pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup light sour cream
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup lemon juice, (23 small lemons)
- 1 cup buttermilk

For the blueberry sauce: 

- 16 ounces blueberries, rinsed
- 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour or corn starch
- 1 tablespoon water

For the pudding filling: 

- 1 pkg (3.4oz) instant lemon pudding
- 1 ¾ cups milk

For the topping: 

- 8 ounces mascarpone cheese
- 1 ¼ cups heavy whipping cream
- ½ cup powdered sugar
- Zest of 1 lemon (optional)

INSTRUCTIONS

For the cake: 

Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, vegetable oil, eggs and lemon extract. Beat on medium speed until the eggs and oil are well incorporated and the batter is lighter in color, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the bowl as needed.

Next, add the lemon zest and the sour cream and beat until well combined.

Combine the dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Add half the dry ingredients followed by the lemon juice and half the buttermilk and mix just until the flour starts to incorporate.

Finally add the remaining dry ingredients and buttermilk and beat until all of the ingredients are well combined. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl and stir the batter from the bottom to the top to ensure its well mixed.

Pour the batter into a 9×13-inch pan and bake at 350°F for 28-32 minutes. Test the cake for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the cake. If the toothpick comes out clean, your cake is done. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.

For the blueberry sauce: 

Start by rinsing the berries. In a medium-sized sauce pan, combine blueberries, sugar, flour and water; stir well. Cook over medium-high heat until mixture starts to bubble, stirring often. Turn down heat and let simmer to allow the blueberries to soften. Cook until sauce thickens; around 10-15 minutes. Stir often so the bottom does not burn. Allow to cool for 20 minutes, refrigerate if necessary.

While the cake is still warm, take the end of a wooden spoon or another round object and poke holes all over the top of your cake. Allow to cool for another 20 minutes.

For the pudding filling: 

Combine lemon pudding with milk and whisk until the pudding is dissolved. Pour pudding over top of cake, filling the holes. Refrigerate at least 10 minutes until the pudding is firm.

Pour blueberry sauce over top of the pudding and refrigerate until cake and toppings are cooled.

For the frosting: 

Place the mixing bowl and whisk attachment in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes to chill.

Pour the heavy whipping cream into the chilled bowl and use an electric mixer to beat the heavy cream on medium-high speed until the cream starts to thicken. Slowly add the powdered sugar, vanilla extract and lemon zest and continue beating on high speed until soft peaks form.

Next, spoon the mascarpone into the bowl and continue beating at a high speed until stiff peaks form. Spread over top of cake, be sure the cake is completely cooled before spreading the whipped cream on top.",3527

Malfatti in italian means ""poorly-made"" because of the irregular shape. But don't worry the taste is superb! For the video recipe [HERE](https://youtu.be/DSieZFgoZoA)  
 

&amp;#x200B;

 **INGREDIENTS:**

*  Ricotta cheese  500 gr ( cow or sheep ricotta)  
* 00 flour  135 gr   2 eggs ( 100 gr app)  
* Parmigiano or Grana cheese  40 gr   
* Boiled spinach  135 gr
*  Nutmeg 
*  Salt 
*  A spoon of extra virgin olive oil  
* Garlic clove 
*  Black Pepper 

&amp;#x200B;

 **FOR THE SEASONING**:  

*  Butter   
* Sage  
* Parmigiano or Grana cheese  

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTION**

* Take the ricotta cheese and put in a colander for 30 minutes, and let it drain off the excess liquid in the fridge  
* In a pan, put in the olive oil and the garlic clove. When the garlic starts to brown put in the spinach and the salt. Let them flavor in the oil for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally.  
* Remove the garlic and let the spinach cool.  
* Take the food processor and put all the ingredients and add a sprinkling of nutmeg, salt  and black pepper. Mix until the ingredients are well blended ( a couple of minutes are enough normally).  Leave the mixture to firm up in fridge for about 1 hour. 
*  Now with the help of two spoons shape the malfattI ( you should look the video for the technique but  don't worry they are good even if with a different shape and Malfatti in italian means ""poorly-made""  )
*  When the Malfatti comes to surface they are ready. Keep/Reserve  a half glass of the cooking water. 
*  In a pan put the butter and the sage in. Let the butter start to melt and add the cooking water. When the butter is completely melted add the malfatti and let it cook for minute with the butter.
* And that's all, grated over the parmigiano and serve until they are hot

2020-09-22,3,"How to Make Mozzarella with White Vinegar and No Rennet","cookingwithRobin","**Ingredients:** 

\- 1.5L low temp pasteurized whole milk (can substitute with raw milk or pasteurized milk) 

\- 90ml (3oz) white vinegar 

\- 1 tbsp sea salt (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/avZ67Uu_Fc0)

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Pour the milk into a pot and heat it up to 120-125	, turn off the heat and add white vinegar. Stir the pot gently for 20 seconds to incorporate the milk and the vinegar. 
2. Cover it and let it sit for 5 minutes to form curds.
3. Form the curds into a ball and squeeze out the liquid.
4. Heat up the whey to 165-180	, turn off the heat, put on food safe gloves. Put the cheese back into the whey and let it sit for 15 seconds.
5. Squeeze out the liquid, knead and stretch the curds. Repeat this three to four times to make mozzarella stretchy and stringy. 
6. To shape the mozzarella, take the cheese and push a segment through your thumb and other fingers in a C shape and pinch the bottom off.
7. Leave the mozzarella balls in cold water for 10 minutes before serving.

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. Raw milk, low temp pasteurized, pasteurized milk all work for this recipe. Low fat milk works too, but I like using low temp pasteurized grass fed whole milk due to safety and taste. 
2. If you don't have a thermometer, I demonstrated how to guess the temperature in the video. 
3. Feel free to add salt when kneading the cheese, it will add some flavor.

In this recipe, milk and white vinegar are very accessible, the mozzarella tastes creamy and soft and full of milky flavor, but it won't be as smooth as a cheese made with citric acid and rennet. If you want to make mozzarella very often, I suggest using citric acid and rennet to extract more cheese from the milk.",1799
2020-09-22,24,"Brown Butter Hen of the Woods Pappardelle","saucesandwich_","Wild mushroom pappardelle with brown butter, sage, pecorino, and a raw egg yolk. This is one of my favorite times of year and also one of my favorite wild mushrooms - Hen of the Woods, or Sheepshead, or Maitake, Grifola frondosa. Theyre easy to miss if you dont know what to look for. This could be substituted for any of your favorite mushrooms, but I personally love how the meatiness of the Hen of the Woods stands up against the heft of the pappardelle. Recipe as follows [and a short video about the process can be found here.](https://youtu.be/Lj8cB_371Kw)

**Pappardelle**

Ingredients

450 g 00 Flour

250 g eggs (beaten before mixing)

\*Portioned for 5 - 6 people

Directions

&amp;#x200B;

1. Dump out the weighed      flour onto a clean work surface.
2. Use your hand to      form a well (like a volcano) in the center of the flour.
3. Carefully pour      your eggs into the center and begin slowly mixing together with a fork.      Gradually, carefully, work your way all around to incorporate the eggs      with the flour, without breaking the outer wall.
4. After about 5 -      10 minutes it will start coming together into a shaggy mass. Begin using      your hands to knead the dough together. Work diligently for another 5      minutes until it is no longer shaggy.
5. Use the edges of      your hands, knuckles, to work the dough until it starts to form a smooth      ball. Roll it, applying pressure, into the work surface. Fold it. Roll it      again. After about ten minutes it should be a smooth, and ready to rest.
6. Cut the dough      into two and wrap each in plastic wrap. Set into the fridge for at least      30 minutes.
7. The following      steps revolve around using a pasta attachment on a Kitchenaid - but you      could also do this by hand with a rolling pin. Remove one of the dough      balls, unwrap, and cut off a portion of the dough. Lightly flour and cover      the rest back with plastic. Press gently and form a rectangle.
8. Pass the dough      through the sheet pasta attachment at its widest setting. If it feels      sticky, add a little more flour. Gradually tighten the settings of the      pasta attachment, one click at a time, and pass the pasta sheet through      until it is light and delicate. For pappardelle, I normally go to the 5th      setting.
9. Allow the sheet      of dough (sfoglia) to dry for 2-3 minutes and fold in half. With a knife,      trim off irregular edges. Gently fold the dough into about 3 inch folds,      over and over until you have a nice compact roll.
10. Using your      knife, carefully begin cutting strips of the roll into about 3/4 - 1 inch      (1.9 - 2.5 cm) pieces. I like my pappardelle nice and wide. With your      fingers, unroll each strip and sprinkle with a light coating of semolina.      You can make little nests with each batch that is finished. Repeat until      all of your dough has transformed unto tagliatelle.
11. Cook right away      or store in the fridge covered with a towel.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Pasta**

Ingredients

Wild mushrooms thinly sliced (.5 lb or 250 g)

Butter (1 stick or 120 g)

Garlic (3 cloves finely minced)

Pecorino romano

Black pepper

Sage

Egg

Pasta Water

Directions

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bring a large      pot of water to a boil.
2. Bring a large      skillet to medium heat.
3. Add the thinly      sliced mushrooms to the pan and dry saute for a few minutes, stirring      frequently and careful not to burn. This will remove some of the water      weigh of the mushrooms before you add the fat. Add a drizzle of olive oil      and a sprinkle of salt. Stir again.
4. Add in the      butter and bring to a low simmer, continuing to stir.
5. Add the sage and      garlic, continue to saute and stir for another ten minutes until the      mushrooms are completely cooked through and tender.
6. Meanwhile, cook      your pasta to your liking and be sure to reserve a little pasta water to      lubricate the noodles if necessary.
7. Drain the pasta,      and transfer the noodles directly into the pan with the mushrooms and      browned butter. Toss well so all the noodles are completely covered in the      sauce. Add pasta water (or any extra browned butter) as necessary if it      feels too dry.
8. Plate each dish      with the pappardelle and mushrooms. Create a small well in the middle of      each plate for the egg yolk.
9. Very carefully,      crack and egg and discard of the egg white. Gently place an egg yolk in      the middle of each plate without breaking it.
10. Add a generous      sprinkle of freshly grated pecorino to each plate, along with black pepper      to taste.
11. Enjoy!

***For the sponge cake base:***

* 5 egg(s)
* 175 g sugar
* 1 pck. vanilla sugar
* 125 g flour
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 40 g cornstarch
* 40 g cocoa powder, unsweetened

***For the cherry filling:***

* 350 g sour cherries from the jar
* 30 g cornstarch
* 25 g sugar
* 3 tbsp. cherry brandy

***For the cream filling:***

* 1200 g whipped cream
* 40 g sugar
* 1 pck. vanilla sugar
* 2 pck. cream stiffener

***To decorate:***

* 100 g grated chocolate
* 50 g cherry(s)

**Instructions:**

1. Separate the eggs. Beat the egg whites with half of the sugar until stiff. Beat the egg yolks with the remaining sugar until creamy. Then pour the egg yolk mixture onto the egg whites and stir in. Mix the flour with baking powder, cornstarch, vanilla sugar and cocoa and sieve carefully onto the dough mixture. Mix all ingredients with a spoon.
2. Smooth the dough in a springform pan (26 cm) lined with baking parchment, put it on the rack in the preheated oven and bake at 180°C top/bottom heat for about 25 minutes. **Note that the form must not be greased/buttered, otherwise the cake can't rise.** After baking, remove the edge of the springform pan, let the cake cool completely.
3. For the cherry filling, drain the sour cherries well on a sieve. Collect 250 ml of the juice. Mix the starch with sugar and 4 tbsp. of the juice. Bring the remaining juice to a boil, remove from stove, stir in the starchy liquid. Bring to the boil again briefly, stir in the cherries and refrigerate. Add cherry brandy to taste (skip if the cake should be non-alcoholic).
4. Cut the cooled sponge cake twice horizontally with a large, sharp knife or with a thread. Place the bottom cake base on a cake plate, put a cake ring around, this makes it easier to stack the cake.
5. Whip the heavy cream with sugar, vanilla sugar and cream stiffener until very stiff. As there is a lot of cream, it is recommended to whip the cream stiff in two stages.
6. Spread the cherry mixture and 1/3 of the cream on top. Place the middle cake layer on top, press it down slightly and spread half of the remaining cream on top. Place the top cake layer on top and press down lightly. Save some cream (3-5 tbsp.) from the remaining cream in an icing bag. Tip: Between layers, sprinkle some cherry brandy (or some of the sour cherry juice) on the cake before the cream, so the cake can absorb the liquid and offers a more juicy cake. 
7. Spread the top and the edge of the cake with the remaining cream. Decorate with the saved cream, grated chocolate and cherries.",2543

Pandan juice

1. Cut the pandan leaves into 1 inch strips and place in a blender with the water
2. Blend the leaves together with the water and strain out the liquid
3. Press the broken up leaves through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth in order to get as much pandan juice out of it as you can! (the more fresh the pandan leaves, the more juice they'll have!)

Kaya

1. In a medium sauce pot, whisk together the eggs and sugar
2. Then pour in the coconut milk and pandan juice and mix to combine
3. Put the pot over low-medium heat (double boiler method is encouraged but not absolutely required if the heat remains low) and constantly whisk until the mixture has thickened (anywhere from 30-50 minutes depending on desired end consistency)
4. NOTE: if the eggs curdle at any point, this is completely fine! just keep whisking together the mixture until it has thickened to the desired consistency, then pour it all into a blender and blend until smoooooth!
5. After the kaya has finished thickening (blend the mixture if a smoother consistency is desired), transfer to a lidded, air tight container and keep refrigerated until ready for use

Kaya is basically a jam made from coconut milk, and the nonya variety has pandan juice in it! The jam is nice and sweet, creamy and coconutty from the coconut milk, and soft and fragrant from the pandan! It's traditionally added to toast and eaten as a breakfast item in Singapore!

# Ingredients for Zucchini Flan

&amp;#x200B;

* 3 medium sized zucchini
* 4 green onions
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 4 eggs
* 1 cup sour cream (can use creme  fraiche if you want a creamier flavor and can actually find it at your grocery store)
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1/2 cup of grated Gruyere or Swiss cheese

# Ingredients for Tomato Coulis

&amp;#x200B;

* 2 ripe tomatoes
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 bay leaves
* 1 clove garlic (\~1 heaping tsp of minced garlic)
* 1/2 tsp thyme
* 1/2 basil
* 1 tbsp honey (can also use sugar if making for a baby who can't have  honey or just leave out the sweetener all together if your tomatoes are  sweet)
* small handful of parsley
* salt and pepper to taste

# How to Make Zucchini Flan

&amp;#x200B;

1. Steam your zucchini. There are lots of ways to do do this. I bring a  little bit of water to boil in a pot then insert a steamer basket with  my zucchini in it.
2. Slice up your zucchini very thin.
3. To make filling, cut up green onion very small and saute them with  olive oil until the pan sizzles slightly(this should be pretty short)  and then turn off and let cool by just abandoning the entire recipe and  going and doing something else (like making the tomato coulis).
4. When its cool mix together green onions, olive oil, eggs, sour cream, salt and nutmeg.
5. Put wax paper in your casserole dish and spray so it doesn't stick.
6. Place thin slices of zucchini until it  covers the dish in one layer  and cover by pouring a thin layer of egg and creme mixture on top of  it. Add another layer of zucchini and cover with egg and creme mixture.  Keep doing this until you are out of zucchini. I usually do about 2.8  layers with not quite enough zucchini to do a complete 3rd layer and  then just pour the rest of the creme mixture over the top.
7. Spread cheese over the top of this.
8. Put in oven and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 30-40 minutes.  Its done when the cheese is slightly light brown and your mouth is  watering.

# How to Make the Tomato Coulis

&amp;#x200B;

1. Dice tomatoes and put in saucepan with olive oil on stove.
2. Add the other ingredients.
3. Warm up the pan until it seems that the contents are hot. Then turn  off and remove from heat. Let cool. You don't want to cook it too much  because then it gets too mushy we just want it slightly cooked.
4. Serve this on top of the zucchini flan and place a little bit of parsley on top to make it look great.",2555

2020-09-21,19,"Cajun Chili","CapnJacksPharoah","Throw-together from things I had on hand; happy with how it turned out so sharing here:

\*\*Ingredients\*\*

1 cup chopped onion (\~1/4 inch chop or a bit finer for all)

1 cup chopped celery

1 cup chopped pepper (I used sweet banana pepper from my garden, green bell pepper would be more traditional)

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 lb Andouille sausage, sliced 1/4 - 3/8 thick

1 can (15 oz) chick peas, drained

1 can (15 oz) black beans, drain liquid from the top

1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes

1/2 to 1 can (10 oz can) diced tomatoes with chilies

1 tsp dried basil

Canola oil

Salt and pepper, to taste

Cayenne pepper, to taste

Dried parsley (for garnish)

Grated cheese (for serving)

Louisiana style hot sauce, as desired

Cooked pasta or rice, as desired

\*\*Directions\*\*

1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a good-sized skillet over medium high heat, cook the sausage until it has a nice sear and is thoroughly hot.  Remove sausage to a bowl, leaving the oil / grease behind.
2. Add chopped celery and peppers to the skillet, season with salt and pepper to taste and cook until they just start to soften, remove from heat.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat and cook the garlic until fragrant, about a minute, then add the chopped onion.
4. Add the partially cooked celery and peppers and cook until they have come back up to temperature.
5. Add the sausage and cook until it has come back up to temperature.
6. Add the crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes with chilies, season with salt, pepper and basil to taste (add cayenne pepper if desired for a bigger spice kick).
7. When the mixture has come up to temperature, add the black beans (with part of the liquid) and drained chickpeas.
8. Reduce heat to simmer, cover pan and cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
9. Serve over pasta or rice, garnish with grated cheese and dried parsley (would be good with a spicy crema as well - see notes below).

\*\*Notes\*\*

I did not add any cayenne pepper and only used 1/2 can of the diced tomatoes with chilies; my wife isn't big on heat.

I think a spicy crema would be a good addition to this dish: Mix 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (or more to taste) into 2 Tbsp of sour cream and mix in enough water (1 tsp at a time) so that the mixture can be drizzled on; let it sit a few minutes for the flavor to develop before using.

### Equipment

* Two bowls
* Electric hand mixer
* 9×5 loaf pan

### Ingredients

* 1¾ cup flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 2 teaspoons allspice
* 1 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 15 ounce can pumpkin purée or fresh
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 3 tablespoons maple syrup
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

#### Maple Glaze:

* ½ cup confectioners sugar plus more, if needed
* ¼ cup maple syrup plus more, if needed
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* Heavy cream or whole milk as needed

### Instructions

#### Mix the Dry Ingredients:

* Preheat oven to 375ºF. Grease a 9×5 loaf pan.
* In a bowl, combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, and salt and mix together with a fork.

#### Mix the Wet Ingredients:

* In a large bowl, combine pumpkin purée and sugar and whisk until smooth. Add the eggs and maple syrup and whisk again. Add vanilla extract and vegetable oil and whisk again until smooth.

#### Combine the Wet and Dry Ingredients:

* Add half the flour mixture to the bowl of wet ingredients and whisk until just combined. Add the remaining flour and whisk until no lumps remain. Do not over mix the ingredients! Set aside.

#### Bake:

* Pour the pumpkin mixture into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 20-24 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.

#### Make the Maple Glaze:

* Combine all the ingredients except for the cream for the maple glaze and mix with an electric mixer until completely smooth. If the glaze needs thinned out, add a splash or two of heavy cream or whole milk. If youd like a stiffer glaze, add more confectioners sugar and mix again until smooth.

#### Glaze the Loaf:

* See note in recipe. If you want a traditional, thick glaze on the loaf, allow the bread to cool completely before glazing. If you want to have the loaf absorb a bit of the glaze, pour it on the loaf after it has cooled mostly but is still a bit warm.
* Slice the loaf and serve. Enjoy!

2020-09-20,12,"Persian Saffron Rice with Tahdig (Crispy Bottom Rice)! (Recipe included)","yvonnemeetsfood","In Persian cuisine, rice is often prepared by steaming with oil or butter to create a crispy layer of rice on the bottom of the pot called tahdig. Tah"" means bottom and *dig* means pot in Farsiits literally what happens *at the bottom of the pot*. Thus, its known as bottom of the pot rice, or scorched crispy rice. 

Many cultures have a variation of this (hello, paella and Cantonese claypot rice!), and as a child, I always looked forward to the crunchy rice on the bottom of the rice pot that my grandma made, as well as in Cantonese claypot rice. The bottom of the pot rice was always our favorite!

Tahdig is oftentimes the one dish at the Persian table that immediately disappears, as diners can even fight over the last crispy bits! Let me know if you give this recipe a try and what you think! 

  
**Persian rice with Tahdig - Recipe**

**To parboil the rice:** 

* 2 cups extra-long grain white basmati rice, rinsed of excess starches until clear (4-5 times), then soaked for about 3-5 hours
* 7 cups water
* 2 Tbsp kosher or sea salt

**To steam the rice:** 

*Part 1 (Preparation and to parboil the rice):*

* 2 Tbsp vegetable oil 
* 2 Tbsp butter or ghee 
* 1/2 tsp saffron threads + 1 pinch of salt; 3 Tbsp hot water 

*Part 2 (to add right before steaming):*  

* 2 Tbsp oil
* 1/4 C water

&amp;#x200B;

1. Take your soaked rice and drain.  
2. In a mortar and pestle or in a small bowl, add saffron threads with a pinch of salt, then using the pestle or the back of a knife, crush the threads against the salt grains. Then, add in 3 Tbsp of hot water to the saffron and mix. Set aside and allow the water to infuse with the glory of the saffron.  
3. In a large, non-stick pot (that isnt too deep! 5-6 qt capacity and 5 inch deep at max is ideal) and has a tight fitting lid, bring about 7 C water to a boil on medium-high heat. Add kosher salt to this water.  
4. Add drained rice to the boiling water, then bring the water back to a boil on medium-high heat for about 7-10 min, or until the grains are long and soft on the outside, but still hard in the center (al dente). Drain the rice in a colander and rinse with some cool water.  
5. Wash the rice pot out with water and return to medium heat. Add 2 Tbsp vegetable oil, 2 Tbsp butter, and 1 tablespoon of the liquid saffron to the bottom of the pot, moving around so that the bottom is evenly covered with the saffron liquid and the fats.  
6. Remove the pot from the heat, and quickly return the parboiled rice back into the pot, building a mound shape with the rice so that most of the rice is away from the sides of the pot. To allow for the steam release, poke 5-8 holes in the rice with the end of a wooden spatula.  
7. Place the pot back on medium-high heat, uncovered. After about 7-10 minutes, some steam should be coming out of the pot. At this point, pour 2 Tbsp oil, 1/4 C waters and the remaining saffron liquid over the rice. Cover with the lid wrapped in a tea or kitchen towel. This will ensure the condensation will not go back into the pot.  
8. Turn the heat down to low, and steam for about 1 hour. Then, remove from heat. Loosen edges of the rice from the sides of the pot with a spatula. Then, place a flat plate larger than the diameter of your pot over your pot. Flip over so that the bottom of the pot rice is on top now. Serve with your favorite Persian stews, grilled meats and vegetables, or fish. ",3413

* The dough should be soft but still thick

**3. Rest**

* Store the cookie dough sealed in the fridge at 4-6°C (39,2-42,8°F) for 30 minutes

**4. Shape**

* Take 2 baking plates and cover them with parchment paper

**7. Glaze**

* 100 g Powdered sugar
*  Lemon juice
* -----------
* Fill a small bowl with powdered sugar
* You will have to decide how thick you want the glaze to be because the less lemon juice you add the thicker the glaze will be
* Therefore take the lemon juice that you prepared beforehand, add just a bit of it to the powdered sugar and stir until well combined
* If you want to have the glaze less thick, just add a bit more juice and stir again until well combined
* After you get your preferred thickness with a small fork or spoon pour the glaze over the lemon sugar cookies creating little stripes
* Wait at least 30 minutes and check if the glaze has hardened enough
* If not, just give it some more time",2998

Lunch today is salmon fried rice with leftover rice and salmon from last night. Super easy and incredibly delicious. I have about two cups of rice and maybe 3/4 lb salmon, flaked. Will stir fry garlic and ginger and diced veggies in the pan, add rice and soy sauce and oyster sauce, then the salmon and chopped green onion at the end.

Dinner is a snap - a couple in my neighborhood just had a baby and I volunteered for meal train tonight. I'm marinating chicken thighs in our fave barbecue sauce. Hubby will cook it on the grill. I'll serve with grilled corn, mashed red potatoes, and roasted broccoli. It is easy to pack in a foil pan and deliver, and easy for them to keep warm in the oven until they're ready to eat.

And it's not quite fall here in Texas but I'm craving soup!! I'm eying this mushroom soup for Sunday lunch: https://cafedelites.com/creamy-mushroom-soup/. My kids will eat any soup if I make an ooey-gooey grilled cheese with it.

Sunday dinner, I'm thinking a boneless leg of lamb with parmesan potatoes and a bright vinegary veggie salad. Or leftovers. Whatever feels right. >*",1663

## Equipment

* Medium pot
* Wide pan or deep skillet
* Skillet
* Colander

## Ingredients

## Brothy Farro:

* 1 cup farro
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 4 cloves garlic peeled and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 4 cups water
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 6 scallions trimmed and minced
* 4 Roma tomatoes quartered
* Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

## Swordfish:

* 1 pound swordfish cut into 4 ounce portions
* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

## Cook the Farro:

* Bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a pot. Add the farro and 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to a low boil and cook for 25-30 minutes. The farro should be tender but not overcooked. Drain and set aside.

## Prepare the Broth:

* While the farro cooks, prepare the broth. In a wide pot, heat the extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, for 5-6 minutes until translucent. Do not let the onion brown.
* Add the sliced garlic and cook another minute or so.
* Melt the butter into the pot. Once frothy, add the water and bring to a boil. Season liberally with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Add the thyme.

## Simmer the Broth:

* Reduce heat on the broth to low and stir in the scallions and the cooked farro. Simmer the broth for 20 minutes. Add the Roma tomatoes and cook for 5-10 minutes more. Taste and season again to your preferences.

## Cook the Swordfish:

* After adding the tomatoes to the broth, cook the swordfish.
* Pat the swordfish dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
* Heat the oil in a skillet over high. Once very hot, add the swordfish and cook without moving for 2-4 minutes. *Note: Depending on the size of your skillet, you may need to cook the swordfish in batches. Do not overcrowd the skillet.*
* Flip the swordfish and add the butter. Cook an additional 2-4 minutes, using a spoon to baste the swordfish as it cooks. Turn off the heat.

## To Serve:

* Divide the brothy farro between shallow bowls and place a seared swordfish filet on top. Garnish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, if desired. Enjoy!

###**Written Recipe**

###**Ingredients**

* Oil : 3 tbsp
* Pumpkin cut into cubes : 1/2 cup
* Salt to taste
* Turmeric Powder : 1.5 tsp
* Ginger Garlic Paste : 1 tbsp
* Chopped Onions : 1 medium size
* Coriander Powder : 1 tbsp
* Dry mango powder : 1 tbsp
* Pumpkin (pureed) : 1 cup
* Boiled Chickpeas : 1 cup
* Cashewnut paste : 1/2 cup
* Sugar : 2 tbsp

**For Tempering -**

* Ghee (or oil) : 1 tbsp
* Cumin seeds : 1 tsp
* Fenugreek Seeds : 1/2 tsp
* Asafoetida : a pinch
* Dried Red Chillies : 2
* Cashewnuts : 12-15
* Kashmiri Red Chilly Powder : 1 tbsp

* Finely chopped and unseeded Green Chillies to Garnish.

###**Directions**:  

Step 1) Add oil to a wok and add pumpkin cubes to it. 

Step 2) Add turmeric and salt to season.

Step 3) Fry them until golden and crisp from all sides. Take them out and keep them aside. We'll need these later.

Step 4) In the same oil, add ginger garlic paste and cook until raw aroma goes away.

Step 5) Add chopped onions and saute it until golden.

**Note: Don't let the onions get brown or the dish will come out in darker color which we don't want.**

Step 6) Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, salt and roast for 1 minute on low flame.

Step 7) Add dry mango powder to it. You can use tamarind pulp as well.

**Note: Always dissolve dry mango powder in some water before adding it to the dish. This prevents it from getting lumpy.**

Step 8) Add pureed pumpkin to it and cook for 7-8 minutes or until you see it's color getting bit dark and the puree reduces in quantity a bit.

**Note: To make puree, just grind small pieces of raw pumpkin without adding any water.**

Step 9) Add boiled chickpeas to it and give it a mix.

Step 10) Add cashewnuts paste to it and mix thoroughly.

**Note: Soak cashewnuts in water for 2 hours and then blend it using the same water. Please do not use blanched cashews in this recipe because they do not give the same texture.**

Step 11) Cover it and cook for no more than 4 minutes on low flame otherwise the mixture might start sticking to the bottom because of the cashews.

Step 12) Add sugar to it. You can also twice the amount of honey as well. 

Step 13) Now add fried pumpkins cubes to it and give it a mix.

**Note: This step is optional. You can completely skip adding pumpkin cubes but they give a nice crunchy texture to the dish.**

**Time to make a special tempering**

Step 1) Add ghee or oil to a pan and heat it on low flame.

Step 2) Add Cumin seeds, Fenugreek seeds, asafoetida, dried red chillies and cashewnuts and roast on low flame for 40 seconds.

Step 3) Now add Kashmiri Red Chilly Powder to it and turn off the flame immediately or the color will quickly get spoiled. 

**Note: If you feel like your tempering is too and and it might burn the chilly powder, add a tablespoon of water immediately after adding chilly powder.**

Step 4) Pour this tempering over the pumpkin and mix well.

**Note: Adding tempering in the last like this enhances the flavour many folds.**

Step 5) Add chopped and unseeded green chillies to finish it off.

**Creamy, Tangy and Savory Pumpkin - Chickpeas Pot is ready.**

**Serve it alongside Lentil, Plain rice &amp; Puri for a wholesome meal combo**",3259

**Yield:** 15 cm cake

**Ingredients:**

**-- Crust --**

110 g graham cracker or digestive biscuit 

60 g unsalted butter, melted 

36 g brown sugar (optional) 

**-- Cheesecake --**

35 g water 

4 g (1¼ tsp) gelatin powder 

150 g cream cheese, at room temperature 

50 g granulated sugar 

10 g lemon juice (optional) 

60 g plain yogurt 

150 g whipping cream 

**Instructions:**

**-- Crust --**

1. Crush the biscuit into fine crumbs using a food processor. Or seal them in a Ziploc plastic bag and roll them with a rolling pin. 
2. Transfer to a bowl. Combine well with butter and sugar (if using). 
3. Transfer a third of the mixture into a 15 cm cake mold. Spread evenly before using the bottom of a glass to press the mixture onto the base. Pack it down as much as possible. 
4. With the glass sitting on the crust center, spread the remaining crumbs around the cake perimeter. Move the glass to pack the surrounding crumbs as even and tight. Refrigerate while you prepare the filling. 

**-- Cheesecake --**

1. Sprinkle gelatin evenly onto the water. Let it sit for at least 5 minutes to bloom. 
2. In a medium bowl, smoothen the cream cheese with a rubber spatula until creamy. Mix in sugar. Then add lemon juice (if using) and yogurt. Mix until the mixture becomes really smooth. 
3. In a cold bowl, whip the cream until thick and creamy with a cold whisk. Cold equipment will simply speed up the whipping process. 
4. Melt the bloomed gelatin in a microwave or bain-marie. Heat just until it is fully dissolved. Then, mix it well with the cheese mixture. 
5. Lastly, fold in the whipped cream until fully combined. 
6. Pour mixture into prepared crust base. Spread and smoothen the top with an offset spatula. 
7. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or best overnight. To remove the cake ring, wrap the sides with a hot wet towel until it loosens up. Then, slice and enjoy!",1996

3/4 cup of almond milk

3 tablespoon of white granulated sugar

Step 1:

Peel and cut ripe bananas into 13 thick pieces. Freeze the bananas in the freezer until completely frozen. This will allow the powder blender or food processor to easily break down the banana.

Step 2:

Add 4 cups of the frozen bananas, 1 1/2 cup of frozen strawberries, 3/4 cup of almond milk, and 3 tablespoons of white granulated sugar into your blender. Blend on high until mixture is well blended and is a soft serve ice cream texture. Be sure to pause and scrap down the sides of the blender in between blending to insure ice cream is well blended.

Step 3:

Your ice cream is now ready to be eaten (if you like a very soft serve texture) or you can pour your ice cream mixture into an ice cream container and freeze for a stiffer ice cream texture.

If you do not have an ice cream container, any airtight container will work. Some plastic containers will get brittle in the freezer so check to make sure it is freezer safe.",1328

2020-09-15,11,"Air-fryer Bread Pudding","Kibology","Another alternative method for making bread pudding: I occasionally make bread pudding in a rice cooker! This recipe was in the manual for one of my rice cookers:

[imgur - rice cooker bread pudding recipe](https://imgur.com/a/Jusirjx)

It's not quite the same as baking it in a casserole dish because the top won't crisp, but the ""white rice"" cycle in a rice cooker is excellent for bread pudding because it will cook until it senses it's getting solid on the bottom. I've found it to be very forgiving about what type and quantity of bread are used, and what mix-ins (such as dried fruit, or chopped nuts) are added. (Mix everything in a large bowl, so that all the bread is moistened, before dumping the mixture into the cooker.)

Obviously I haven't tested this in *every* rice cooker there is, but it has worked well in the two I have.

Bread pudding is my favorite way of using up leftover or stale bread (or rolls or buns.)",930

* 3 tablespoons butter
* 2 cups arborio rice
* 6 cups vegetable stock

* Salt and pepper to taste

## For Serving:

## Instructions

## Marinate the Tomatoes:

* In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, minced garlic, 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Set aside for 15 minutes.

## Start Risotto:

* Heat the stock in a small pot on the stove until warm. Keep the heat on low.

## Sauté the Onion:

* In a large pot, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring often, for 5-7 minutes until it begins to soften and turn golden brown.

## Cook the Tomatoes:

## Incorporate the Stock:

* With the heat on medium, spoon 1-2 ladles of stock into the rice. Stir gently until the liquid is absorbed. Repeat, adding 1-2 ladles of stock and stirring gently until the stock is absorbed. Continue on until the rice is al dente. You may not use all 6 cups of stock.

## Finish the Risotto:

* Once the rice is tender, turn off the heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Add the grated parmesan cheese and stir to incorporate. Allow the risotto to rest for 5 minutes before serving.

## To Serve:

* In a small bowl, combine the reserved halved cherry tomatoes, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper and toss to combine.

* Onions (Thinly Sliced) : 250-300 gm
* Cashews : 15 
* Yogurt : 250 gm 
* Ghee (or Oil) : 3 tbsp

**Dry spices** 

* Coriander Powder : 3 tbsp 
* Red Chilly Powder : 1/2 tsp 
* Turmeric Powder : 1/2 tsp 
* Kashmiri Red Chilly Powder : 1.5 tbsp
* Cumin Powder : 1 tsp  

**Whole Spices**:

* Cloves : 5-6 
* Black Peppercorns : 6-7 
* Green Cardamoms : 6 
* Black Cardamoms : 2 
* Star Anise (Chakra Phool) : 1 
* Cinnamon (Dal Cheeni) : 1 inch 
* Nutmeg (Javitri) - 1
* Mace (Jayphal) 

* Kewra Water - 1 tbsp 
* Ginger Juliennes - 7-8 
* Ginger Garlic Paste - 1 tbsp 
* Coriander Leaves : handful 
* Salt to taste.

###**Directions :**

**Preparing Soya Chaap:**

Step 1) Boil soya chaap for 15 minutes (or as per instructed on the tin).

Step 2) Take them out and pat dry with a paper towel.

Step 3) Fry soya chaap until they get golden from both sides. (This step can be done right before frying onions like in the video).

Step 4) Take them out and dump them into salty water. This step ensures the chaap remain soft and moist.

**Preparing Gravy**

Step 1) In a bowl, add yogurt.

Step 2) Add all the dry spices.

Step 3) Whisk it well.

Step 4) Now in a bowl, add cashews and add hot water to it. Keep aside.

Step 5) In a wok, heat ghee and add thinly sliced onions.

Step 6) Fry it on high flame until they get golden brown. 

_**Note: Make sure to take them out before they reach brown stage as onions have carryover cooking and they get burnt quickly.**_

Step 7) Take the onions out, cool them down and grind them along with blanched cashews into a fine paste.

Step 8) Add all the whole spices to the ghee and roast for 30 seconds.

Step 9) Add ginger juliennes and ginger garlic paste and cook until raw aroma goes away. 

Step 10) Add Yogurt and spice mixture and cook on low flame.

_**Note: Yogurt has lots of water and we need to evaporate it completely. You'll see it bubbling in the beginning. We need to cook until the bubbling gets minimum and oil/ghee comes on top.**_

Step 11) Cover and cook it for 6-7 minutes or until ghee comes on top.

Step 12) Add the paste of fried onions and blanched cashews and mix thoroughly.

_**Note: Onions and cashews are already cooked so we don't need to cook them for long.**_

_**Note: If you're using chicken instead of soya chaap, then add chicken pieces here and roast them on high flame for 4 minutes.**_

Step 13) Add water to it, cover it and cook it on low flame for 10 minutes.

**After 10 minutes, the gravy will thicken a bit and oil will come on top again.**

Step 14) Add Soya Chaap to it and coat it with gravy. Cover it again and cook for 10 more minutes.

Step 15) After ten minutes, add grated nutmeg, mace, coriander leaves and kewra water to it.

_**Note: It's important to not skip the above ingredients as they give korma their unique taste.**_

Step 16) Turn off the flame, cover it and let it sit for 10 minutes. Korma is ready.

_Serve it hot with naan, roti and rice._",3083

2020-09-14,42,"[Monday] What are your recipe questions?","paraclete01","This is a good question that I'd like to learn more about too.  I make several recipes that use wine and different vinegars, but I haven't considered why one is better than another in each situation, but they just feel right for each dish.  
  
Red wine(cab sav/pinot noir) for beef+paprika goulash.  The plum/cherry/oak flavor of the wine just melts well into the beef and potato flavors.  The recipe calls for adding 1-2 Tbsp of vinegar just before serving.  
  
White wine for saffron risotto.  The floral aromas of the wine go well with the saffron and parmesan.  
  
Apple cider vinegar for my coleslaw.  The apple flavor with the mustard and celery seed yum.  
  
Red wine vinegar I like better than regular vinegar for salad dressings.  It's easy to say here that the rw vinegar is a necessity over red wine for the acidity and milder flavors.  If I'm making a oil,vinegar, mustard, lemon, oregano dressing I use white vinegar.  But for roasted red pepper, cilantro, shallot dressing it's gotta be rwv.  
  
Lemon juice adds acidity to the oil, but the citric acid isn't aromatic.  I think the vinegar has that distinctive aroma that is sour but pleasant in the right mix.  Maybe the vinegar acts to almost lift the aromas of the other flavors up to better perceive them.   
  
I made a [rhubarb shrub drink mix](https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-a-shrub-759919) a few years ago and kept it in my frige for about 4 weeks.  They're an interesting way to experiment in vinegar/fruit mixing.",1499
2020-09-13,1,"Peanut Butter Banana Pudding","captainthomas","**PEANUT BUTTER BANANA PUDDING**

makes H 2 quarts by volume

**INGREDIENTS** 

* 5-6 ripe bananas, cut into 1/2-inch slices, divided

* 2 1/4 cups dry roasted unsalted peanuts, divided, plus more for garnishing

* 3/4 cup smooth, commercial, stably-emulsified peanut butter, divided

* 4 eggs, separated 

* 3 tbsp cornstarch

* 2 1/4-1/2 cups water

* 1/2 cup granulated sugar

* 1/3 cup brown sugar

* 3/4 cup powdered sugar

* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

* 12 tbsp unsalted butter, divided, plus more for greasing pans

* 1/4 tsp salt or to taste

* 1 tsp vanilla extract

* 1/2 cup-ish banana liqueur (Tempus Fugit, Bols, 99 Bananas, etc.)

* optional: whipped cream, hot fudge, marshmallow fluff, chocolate chips, grape/raspberry/strawberry jelly, etc.

**PUDDING**

1. The night before, soak 1 cup peanuts in cold water in the fridge.  When youre ready to make the pudding, strain out the peanuts and place them in a blender with the water.  Blend until smooth, about 2 minutes.  Strain mixture through a cheesecloth and discard the solids.  If you end up with less than 2 cups of peanut cream, top it off with heavy cream and whisk to combine.

2. In a heatproof glass container, combine the 4 egg yolks, 3 tablespoons cornstarch, and 1/4 cup peanut cream.  Whisk to combine.

3. In a saucepan, combine the rest of the peanut cream, the granulated sugar, and the salt and bring it to a boil over medium heat.  Slowly drizzle several tablespoons of the hot cream mixture into the yolk mixture, whisking the yolk mixture constantly and vigorously.  Pour the tempered yolk mixture into the saucepan, whisk to combine, return to the heat, and keep whisking at a more leisurely pace until it thickens.

4. Remove the pan from the heat and immediately whisk in 1 tbsp butter until incorporated.  Then whisk in 9 tbsp peanut butter.  The pudding will be very thick.  Whisk in the vanilla and 2 tbsp banana liqueur.  Scrape the pudding into another vessel and set aside to cool to room temperature.

5. Toss 3 bananas-worth of sliced banana with the brown sugar and place in an 8 x 8 inch baking dish.  Dot with 1 tbsp butter.  Bake at 400ºF for 40 minutes, until golden brown.  Immediately remove from the oven and scrape the pans contents into a blender or food processor and puree until smooth.  Let stand until cooled to room temperature.  Whisk the caramelized banana puree into the pudding until evenly incorporated, and chill until ready to assemble  the final product.

**PEANUT BUTTER FINANCIERS** 

1. In a food processor, grind 3/4 cup peanuts with the powdered sugar and flour until fine.

2. In a small saucepan, melt 10 tbsp butter on low heat, stirring occasionally to break up foam on the surface, until it boils, then slowly turns golden brown and the solids turn dark brown and sink to the bottom.  Keep warm until ready to use.

3. In a stand mixer, beat the 4 egg whites with the whisk beater on medium speed until foamy.  Slowly mix in the contents of the food processor on low speed until incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula as needed.

4. Raise the speed to medium-low and very, very slowly drizzle in the warm browned butter, as if you were making mayonnaise.  The batter should be thick, shiny, and fully emulsified with no lumps.  Add 3 tbsp peanut butter and mix on medium-low speed just until it is incorporated.

5. Scrape the batter into a greased financier pan, filling the cavities about 2/3 full (This recipe makes 15-16 standard financiers.  If your pan only fits 12, the overflow can be baked in a muffin pan.).

6. Bake at 375ºF for 15-18 minutes.  Let cool to room temperature in the pans.

**ASSEMBLY**

1. Fold as much of the remaining banana slices and peanuts into the chilled pudding as you like, until youve achieved your desired density/texture.  If you want to add the optional chocolate chips or some other small, hard mix-in, you should fold them in at this step.

2. Spread a layer of the chilled pudding on the bottom of your serving container.  Cut the financiers into eighths and arrange a layer of these on top.  Brush them with additional banana liqueur, as you would do for ladyfingers in a tiramisu.  If adding any optional soft, spreadable mix-ins, spread them in a layer on top of the soaked financiers.

3. Repeat this layering until you run out of financiers and pudding.  Top with the optional whipped cream, and garnish with more peanuts.  Chill until ready to serve.

4. Make yourself a nice cocktail with the rest of the bottle of banana liqueur you probably had to buy especially for this recipe.  You deserve one after all your hard work.  I like to mix a couple fingers of it with some butterscotch schnapps and a nut-flavored liqueur in a tumbler and top it off with Baileys.  It goes great with peanut butter banana pudding.",4823

Insight:

* Meat surface browning intensifies the flavour thanks to Millard reactions. In the process, carbohydrates react with amino acids creating hundreds of delicious compounds.
* At a temperature of 70C (158F) connective tissue collagen begins to dissolve into gelatin making meat significantly more tender.

4. Once the red beans are done cooking, remove all but 1/4 cup of water from the pot
5. Pour in the sugar
6. Heat the red beans, sugar, and water over medium heat
7. Constantly stir the red beans until the paste slowly forms and the mixture thickens (once you're able to stir and see the paste sticking together nicely you're done)

2020-09-13,8,"[Sunday] Your recipe of the week!","LavaPoppyJax","I made enchilada sauce in the instant pot (I use more chile powder and less salt). I use pure Ancho chile powder, about a heaping Tbsp. There is also chipotle in this, but you could just add more chile powder and some smoked paprika. We like this recipe as it is more tomatoey, and I always have the ingredients on hand. I use red or green bell pepper. After I open the chipotle can, I freeze the rest in ice cube tray, one chile with sauce in each cube, lined with plastic wrap, then bagged.

I then cook the chicken breast in the sauce 10 min, natural release and shred. I roll the enchiladas with chicken and cheese and diced ortega green chiles added to the sauce, instead of doing a casserole like she does. This is from the 'Butter Chicken Lady's' book Easy Instant Pot recipes. But many recipes are on her website Two Sleevers by Urvashi Pietre.

2020-09-12,6,"Chicken Meatball Gravy - Cooked with cashew based gravy and cream","keescuisine","**Description:** This is a versatile dish that can be made in several ways using different meats. I used chicken (ground/ minced) to make this recipe. The meatballs are so juicy that when you take a bite into them, they instantly melt in your mouth. Using cream and butter is the key to make chicken balls fluffy and succulent. The balls are incredibly flavorsome as they are coated with thick creamy gravy with a touch of tomato puree. You can just have meatballs as it is without adding in gravy as a starter with some sauteed vegetables as a side dish too. In this video, I showed my version of making chicken meat ball gravy with Indian touch. Kids will love these meat balls due to its mild flavors. This curry goes well with flavored rice or can be served as a side dish to Roti / Naan.

**Video instructions** \- [Quick 4-minute video for anyone who would like to see the process](https://youtu.be/9tcfVyk0b6s)

**Directions:**

1. Heat a pan and add some butter. Add finely chopped onions and garlic and saute till golden brown. 
2. Take minced / ground chicken boneless meat in a bowl and add sauteed onion garlic mixture, salt, chopped spring onions, green chillies, garam masala, pepper, cream and butter to it. Mix with your finger tips until just combined.
3. Grease your palm with some oil. Take chicken mixture, make it into small round balls (as shown in video) and keep them aside. 
4. Heat a pan with oil, shallow fry the meat balls until golden brown and take them out onto a paper towel.
5. Take the same pan, with oil. Add onions, tomatoes, soaked cashews, crushed ginger, crushed garlic, turmeric, coriander powder, garam masala, chilli powder and salt. Cook until tomatoes turn mushy. Blend everything to fine puree by adding some water.
6. Now, add some cooking butter to a pan and heat it. Then add your puree to it and let it come to boil. At this level, adjust salt and add a pinch of sugar. When the gravy comes to boil, slowly immerse your meatballs into the gravy and simmer for 5 min.

Author: Kylie Perrotti

### Equipment

* Wide braising pot or soup pot
* Food processor

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil
* 2 pounds chuck roast cut into cubes
* 4 celery stalks a few leaves reserved for garnish
* 2 medium onions peeled
* 2 tablespoons harissa paste
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1/4 cup flour
* 4 large carrots trimmed, scrubbed and cut into thirds
* 3-4 cups beef stock
* 1 28- ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes
* 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* Cayenne powder to taste
* ½ teaspoon celery salt
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Heavy cream optional, for serving
* Olive oil for browning the beef

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Aromatics:

* Add the onion and celery stalks (with leaves) to a food processor and pulse until roughly chopped. Remove some additional celery leaves from the stalk and mince and reserve for garnish. 

#### Brown the beef:

* Pat the beef dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed soup pot or braising pan. Once very hot, brown the beef in batches. Cook the beef cubes for 3-5 minutes on each side until well browned and crisping up around the edges. *Note: If there seems to be a lot of excess oil in the pot, you can drain it off, but dont remove anything stuck to the bottom of the skillet.*

#### Start the Stew:

* Add the celery and onions to the hot pot and cook for 5 minutes or until softened. Add the harissa paste and tomato paste and cook for 3-5 minutes or until the paste starts to turn a deeper red color. Add the flour and stir to coat everything in the pot and cook for 1 minute more.
* Add the beef stock and reduce heat to medium low and whisk continuously until the flour is completely incorporated into the liquid and the broth is smooth. Add the can of tomatoes and their liquid.
* Add the cumin, paprika, ground ginger, garlic powder, cayenne powder to taste and celery salt. Season with salt and pepper.
* Carefully add the beef and the carrots and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and cook for at least 1 hour 30 minutes, stirring occasionally throughout cooking.

#### Finish the Stew:

* Taste the stew and season to your liking. Use a spoon to lightly mash some of the tomatoes to break them up a bit.

#### Shred the Beef:

* Remove the beef cubes from the pot and transfer to a bowl and lightly shred the meat and return it back to the pot. *Note: You do not have to completely shred the beef; simply break apart some of the cubes. You will want a mix of some shredded and some cubed beef throughout the stew.*

#### To Serve:

* Ladle a few spoonfuls of the stew between bowls. Sprinkle a few minced celery leaves on top and drizzle with heavy cream, if desired. Enjoy!

2020-09-12,1,"Pan Seared Tofu With A Surprise Center!","_adventurousbaker_","Full step by step video [here](https://youtu.be/TT3bWddW6IU)

This recipe is based on a Hakka stuffed tofu dish - the difference is that the traditional version is open on one side to reveal the filling whereas the filling is completely enclosed in this one to seal in the flavour.

**Ingredients** (for 6 pieces):

* 1 block firm tofu
* Green onion
* Ginger
* 80g ground pork
* 3-4 raw shrimp
* A pinch of white pepper
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp corn starch

**Directions**

1. Divide the block of tofu into 6 cubes, and halve each cube.
2. With a knife, carefully score a square in each half, leaving around 3-4mm of wall thickness. Then, slowly scoop out the center portion and try to make the recess as square as possible. Its very easy to scoop out too much and leave the bottom of the recess too thin, or broken through completely, so take out the tofu a little at a time.
3. For the filling, mince the shrimp, green onion, and ginger, and add them to the ground pork along with the seasoning. Stir well in one direction only until the filling is evenly mixed and the meat forms sticky strands. You can change up the ingredients a little, but make sure to add substances that allow the filling to bond to the tofu. In this case, the shrimp paste and the corn starch help with the bonding.
4. Fill both halves of each cube of tofu and gently press the 2 halves together. Its recommended to overfill a little bit, because when the halves are closed, theres filling to flow into the corners of the tofu and create a better adhesion interface between the stuffing and the tofu.
5. Now, on medium heat, place the tofu in with one of the non-cut surfaces facing down first. Do not try to stand the tofu up on a cut surface, because the raw filling doesnt have the strength to keep the 2 halves together. Sear for around 3 minutes, or until a light golden color forms, then flip upside down to cook the other non-cut surface. Sear for around 2 minutes, or until golden, and sear each of the 4 remaining faces for an additional 2 minutes each.
6. Transfer to a plate and top off with your favorite sauce and some fresh scallions. Now you have a dish thats sure to surprise and impress your friends and family.",2229

# Japanese Fried Chicken (Karaage)
[Here's a video for those of who would like to see how it all comes together!](https://youtu.be/sE1PJ8ivXUw)
# Ingredients
- Skinless boneless chicken thigh, 1 lb (about two large thighs)
- All-purpose flour 2 heaping tbsp
- 1 egg
- Potato starch or corn starch for battering
- Oil for frying
- Marinade
- Minced garlic 5 cloves
- Minced ginger ½ inch piece
- Soy sauce 3 tbsp
- Cooking sake 2 tbsp
- GARNISH
- Japanese shishito (substitute with seeded jalapenos)
- Japanese Kewpie Mayo
- Japanese 7 spice powder Shichimi

[Full written recipe with ingredients and instructions here.](https://straightupeats.com/crunchy-japanese-chicken-recipe/)

# Instructions
1. Slice the chicken thigh into 7-8 large chunks (refer to the video for a visual aid) and add into a large mixing bowl.
2. Add the **MARINADE** ingredients to the chicken and mix well. Allow the meat to marinade for 10 minutes.
3. Pour out the excess marinade liquid into a separate bowl and set aside.
4. Beat 1 egg and add it to the meat and mix to combine.
5. Add the flour and mix well until no dry flour is visible.
6. Pour the potato starch into a shallow tray and pour in the reserved marinade liquid. Mix the liquid into the starch and press down on any large lumps to create small nuggets. These will add extra crunch to the batter.
7. Batter the chicken pieces in the potato starch one by one (refer to the video for a visual aid). Then lay them onto a sheet, making sure that they are not touching each other. Allow them to sit in the open for five minutes for the outside to dry out. This ensures a crunchier crust on the chicken.
8. Add enough oil for frying to a large pot and heat it to 180 celcius (about 350 F). I highly recommend the use of a kitchen thermometer, as it will ensure that your oil is at the perfect temperature.
9. TRIPLE FRY TECHNIQUE:
10. Add the chicken to the oil, piece by piece. Be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Allow the pieces to sit in the oil, undisturbed for about 15 seconds. Then, gently move them around, making sure that they dont stick to the bottom of the pot. Allow them to continue frying for another 45 seconds (1 minute in total), gently agitating them in the oil.
11. Remove the pieces from the oil onto a draining pan and allow them to rest for 30 seconds.
12. Add the partially cooked chicken back into the oil and fry them for 1 minute.
13. Remove the pieces from the oil again for another 30 seconds.
14. Add the partially cooked chicken back into the oil for one final minute. Remove from the oil and drain well. Continue cooking the rest of the chicken using this triple fry technique.
15. *Optional* Add the shishito peppers (or jalapenos) to the oil and fry until the skin begins to blister, about 30 seconds - 1 minute. Be careful of popping oil. Remove from oil and allow to drain.
16. Pile the chicken onto a plate. Garnish with peppers and slices of lemon. Add a dollop of mayonnaise and sprinkle Japanese 7-spice powder onto the mayonnaise. Serve immediately.",3088

2 shallots peeled and thinly sliced

2 tablespoons butter

2 cups carnaroli or arborio rice

1 pound tomatoes cherry or heirloom

1 head garlic halved crosswise

2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

1 cup extra virgin olive oil

Salt and pepper to taste

#Instructions

**Prepare Tomato Oil (Optional)**

Preheat oven to 375ºF. Arrange the tomatoes and garlic on a lined baking sheet and drizzle with 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. 

Transfer to the oven for 1 hour until the tomatoes are very soft and the garlic is well-roasted.


Using tongs, carefully pop the cloves of garlic from the skin. Transfer the tomatoes and garlic cloves to a blender and pulse until completely blended. Transfer to a fine mesh sieve over a bowl and strain the liquid from the pulp. Discard the pulp.


Whisk the 1 cup extra virgin olive oil into the strained tomato liquid and season with salt and pepper. Cover and transfer to the fridge until needed.


**Start the Risotto:**
In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, sliced garlic, 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Set aside for 15-20 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat the stock in a small pot on the stove until warm. Keep the heat on low.

**Sauté the Shallot:**

In a large pot, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced shallot and cook, stirring often, for 5-7 minutes until it begins to soften.

**Cook the Tomatoes:**

Add the marinated tomatoes and cook for 8-10 minutes until they just begin to soften.

**Cook the Rice:**
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter into the tomatoes and add the rice. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring gently occasionally.

**Incorporate the Stock:**
With the heat on medium, spoon 1-2 ladles of stock into the rice. Stir gently until the liquid is absorbed. Repeat, adding 1-2 ladles of stock and stirring gently until the stock is absorbed until all of the stock as been added.

**Finish the Risotto:**

Once most of the stock has been completely absorbed, add the grated parmesan cheese and half the basil leaves. Taste and season again with salt and pepper. The rice should be tender, but not mushy. Turn off the heat.

**To Serve:**

Divide the cooked risotto between bowls and garnish with the remaining basil leaves and more parmesan cheese. Drizzle with the reserved tomato oil, if desired. Enjoy!

Author: Kylie Perrotti

## Equipment

* Wide pot
* Medium pot

## Ingredients

## Squid:

* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 5 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2 red Fresno chili peppers trimmed and minced; or use crushed red pepper
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 4 Roma tomatoes chopped
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes left whole
* 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* ½ cup fresh basil leaves a few leaves reserved for garnish
* 1 pound squid cleaned; tentacles left whole, tubes cut into rings
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* ½ lemon juiced
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Grits:

* 1 cup yellow corn grits
* 3 cups water
* 1 cup whole milk or ½ cup heavy cream
* 3 tablespoons butter
* Salt, pepper, and paprika to taste

## Instructions

## Cook the Sauce Aromatics:

* Heat 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil in a wide pot. Add the onion and cook for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and minced chili pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

## Cook Tomatoes:

* Melt the butter into the aromatics and add the chopped and whole tomatoes. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the tomatoes begin to break down a bit. Season with salt and pepper.

## Simmer the Sauce:

* Pour in the stock and bring to a bowl. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer over a very, very low boil for 10-12 minutes until the broth is thickened and reduced. Taste and season again to your preferences, adding more crushed red pepper if a spicier sauce is wanted.
* After the sauce has simmered, tear the basil leaves in half and stir into the sauce.

## Prepare the Grits:

* While the sauce is simmering, cook the grits. Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot. Stir in the grits and whisk constantly until they begin to thicken, about 5-10 minutes, reducing heat as necessary to keep the grits from bubbling over too much.
* Whisk in the butter and milk or cream and reduce heat to low, simmering for 10 minutes and whisking occasionally. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika to taste. Keep warm.

## Cook the Squid:

* As the grits finish simmering, cook the squid. Turn to the broiler on high. Pat the squid dry and arrange in an oven layer on top of the tomatoes. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of salt.
* Transfer to the pot to the broiler for 7-9 minutes, checking the squid occasionally, until the squid is opaque and cooked through. Don't overcook the squid.

## Finish the Squid:

* Transfer the pot back to the stove and add the lemon juice.

## To Serve:

* Divide the grits between shallow bowls and pile the squid and tomato sauce on top. Garnish with lemon slices (if desired) and reserved fresh basil leaves. Enjoy!

It is a major test for chefs in Cantonese cooking. The amount of oil needs to be controlled very well, if too dry, the noodle will stick on the pan, but if too wet, the excess oil will ruin the dish and make people feel greasy.

**Ingredients:**

\- 120g top sirloin or flank steak

\- 100g dry wide flat rice noodles

\- 2 green onions

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/CWLGN3nZ99o)

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Soak the dry rice noodle in water for at least three hours. Cut the beef into 2mm slices, and marinate for 30 minutes.
2. Wash bean sprouts, cut onions and green onions. Make a cooking sauce.
3. Turn on the heat to high, add 2 tbsps oil into the hot pan and stir fry the beef slices for 1 minute. Add onion slices and stir fry them for 2 minutes. Put the beef and onions aside for later use. 
4. Strain the noodle and use chopsticks to stir fry the noodle for 2 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent the noodle from sticking to the pan. Add bean sprouts and stir fry for 1 minute.
5. Add the cooking sauce and stir fry for 2 minutes. 
6. Add beef and onions, stir fry until the noodle is fully cooked. 
7. Add green onions and stir fry for 30 seconds. Done! Enjoy!

Note: for octopus i simmered it in a bath of water, a lemon cut in half, dill, bay leaves and pepper corns. (Add a wine cork as many Mediterranean countries believe this helps to tenderise) bring to a boil and then simmer for 20 minutes for a 1kg octo or for slightly larger ones 25. Test with a paring knife it should go straight through. Turn off the heat and let sit for another 20mins and then shock in cold water. Peel off the purple skin, remove beak and viola. I then proceeded to grill it for this recipe with some more paprika, but this is a good base for a caparcio or salad...",2278

&amp;#x200B;

Instructions

Milk Tea Custard

1. Pour the milk and sugar into a small saucepot and place over medium  heat until just barely boiling (it should not foam over and remember to  constantly stir so nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot!)
2. Remove from heat and then pour in the black tea leaves and cover with a lid
3. Allow the tea leaves to steep in the milk for \~7 minutes 
4. In a small bowl, combine the flour and cornstarch
5. In another bowl, whisk together the egg yolks
6. Pour the dry ingredients into the whisked egg yolks and mix until combined
7. Once the tea is done steeping, strain out the leaves and then slowly  pour in the warm milk into the egg yolk mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, and  whisk together
8. Keep pouring in the warm milk into the egg yolk mixture until all of  the milk is incorporated and you end up with a thin, smooth custard  base
9. Pour this custard into a small saucepot and place over medium heat 
10. Constantly stir the custard until it thickens (\~5-10 minutes)
11. Keep stirring the custard over heat until you're able to see the  bottom of the pot (custard will just magically thicken at some time  point so keep watch!)
12. Remove from heat and stir in the butter until it is fully incorporated
13. Transfer the custard to a deep plate and cover with plastic wrap  (push the plastic wrap down so that it touches the top of the custard)
14. Then refrigerate until completely cooled (1-2 hours)

Snow Skin Wrapper

1. In a medium bowl, combine the dry ingredients (glutinous rice flour, rice flour, cornstarch, and powdered sugar)
2. In a small bowl, combine the wet ingredients (milk and oil)
3. Slowly pour the wet ingredients from the small bowl, into the dry  ingredients in the medium bowl and stir until it is well combined (the  resultant mixture should be quite thin)
4. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a steamer for \~20 minutes
5. After 15 minutes, insert a knife into the dough and if it comes out  clean with the dough feeling firm, then it is ready to remove (if not,  allow to steam for a couple more minutes)
6. Remove the bowl from the steamer and allow to cool for 5 minutes
7. Transfer the dough to a cleaned surface and knead by hand until it  is smooth and no longer sticky (no extra oil or flour should be needed)
8. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until cool to the touch

Brown Sugar Boba

1. Boil the boba balls in a small sauce pot for 30 minutes
2. Drain out the liquid and then pour in the brown sugar and stir until it has all melted
3. Allow the boba to soak in the brown sugar for 10 minutes

Assembly

1. Place the remaining 1/4 cup of glutinous rice flour into a small pan  and toast over medium heat until it starts to smell nutty and turns  slightly brown
2. Remove from heat and reserve for dusting later
3. While the dough chills in the fridge, remove the cooled milk tea custard
4. Form the custard into balls by taking a heaping tablespoon of each  and shaping it with your hands (optionally fill the centers of the  custard balls with brown sugar boba!)
5. Once all the custard balls are formed, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the mooncake dough is cooled
6. Remove the mooncake dough from the fridge and shape it into 1 tablespoon round balls as well
7. Take a dough ball and place it onto a clean surface
8. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a \~4in disk
9. Place a custard ball in the center of the dough and wrap the skin around the custard, creating a nice seal at the base
10. Roll the mooncake ball around in the toasted glutinous rice flour and shake off any excess
11. Lightly dust the inside of your mooncake mold with the toasted glutinous rice flour
12. Place the mooncake ball into the mold, seam side away from the pattern and press firmly into the mold
13. Remove and then repeat the above steps with the rest of the dough balls
14. Keep these mooncakes refrigerated in an airtight container as they're best served cold!

2020-09-07,19,"[Monday] What are your recipe questions?","Bouddi","If you want to go fancy pants European flavour I would confit the garlic in extra virgin olive oil, with bay leaf, brown onion and a pinch of salt. Remove the bay leaf and blend it smooth.
Add your confit blend to the soy milk and gently simmer and stir until the flavour is infused, season with white pepper to taste. You should get a thicker ""broth"" this way, but the oil may split once you mix it in. I've never done it to be fair
If you want to keep it thin just simmer the garlic and any aromatics you want (eg bay leaf, parsley, peppercorn, star anise, 5 spice) and seive them out before serving",601

AND SUBSCRIBE! My channel is fireeee =%

Recipe: (10 servings)

* Flour (800 grams)
* Water (345 grams)
* Salt (1.5 tsp)
* Baking Soda (1/4 tsp)

1. Mix Flour, Salt and Baking Soda into a big bowl. Pour water in increments while mixing the ingredients. Knead the dough pushing down and out with force, alternating sides. (Flour dough is very dry and tough, especially in the beginning, it will be difficult to knead)
2. Continue to knead for 5-10 minutes depending on strength and technique, use two hands if needed and transfer to a surface for more space. The dough will get smooth with a bit of bounce-back, then cover it and rest for 1 to 1.5 hours.
3. Take it out and knead the dough again for 2-3 minutes, if it's a large portion cut it in half and then let the dough rest again for 10 minutes.
4. Flatten the dough out with your palms and use a rolling pin to roll a thin sheet (1-2 mm thick). See video for some rolling techniques. Put a generous amount of flour above and below the dough to avoid any sticking. Fold the dough over itself a few times into a rectangle. Use a knife and cut into noodle size pieces. Dust some flour on top and shake the noodles to separate them.
5. To Cook the noodles, use a large amount of water in a pot to dilute the starch and add in some oil and a generous amount of salt. Cook for 3-4 minutes and.... Done!

2020-09-06,41,"Argentinian Bondiola!. really easy and tasty cured pork recipe","TotalmenteMati","**Ingredients**

time. you are gonna need at least 3 weeks or even more.

about 2kg of pork shoulder. or any meat from the neck area. the cuts you get in the us will probably be different than the argentinian one I used. but as long as it has no skin and no bones it will work

a container big enough to fit your meat without touching the sides. it needs to be able to close

enough coarse salt to completely cover the bondiola, it depends on your container

non stick cooking paper (parchment paper, baking paper. I don't know how it's called there)

some string to tie up

50g sweet paprika

50g red pepper flakes

a scale is recommended

**Steps**

1-First you get your meat. if it's kinda roundish you can leave it there. if it has any really weird shapes or is too big you can cut it in half as I did with mine  just make sure the parts are kinda round

2-pour about 2cm of coarse salt in the container. then lay your meat there and completely cover it with coarse salt

3-Leave it in fridge without opening the container for a week. that should mostly dry it and give it some salt taste

4-once a week has passed  you want to get it out of the container. then discard the salt.

5-Completely rinse all salt out of it. none of it can stay. check all little holes and make sure no salt is left

6-dry it with some paper towels make sure it's not wet

7-mix your red pepper flakes and sweet paprika. but not all of it, this is where you select how spicy you want it. I did 60% sweet paprika, 40% red pepper flakes.  you can put a bit less pepper flakes but I wouldn't put more of it in there

8-now with that mix, completely rub the meat with it. make sure it's all covered. you don't need to use all the mix you made. but just make sure you cover all of it

9-once it's covered try to give it a more round shape with your hands. it doesn't need to be perfect

10- now tightly surround it with your cooking paper make sure it isn't loose. once you do that, tie the ends in opossite directions. like one of those candy papers

11-now tie the ends, with your string. then use the string to tie sections of the meat to make it as round as you can

12-Weigh it in your scale and write down the weight.

13-put in fridge. and wait. weigh it periodically once the bondiola weighs 30% less than that weight you measured earlier it's ready to eat, for example if it weighs 2kg. you have to wait till it weighs 1.4kg.

And you Are Done! try to slice it as thin as you can and eat it with some nice bread. this is extremely tasty and really easy and cheap to make. it tastes brilliant and you will be absolutely in love with it. Enjoy! greetings from argentina",2653

* Remove ribs from broth and set aside. Pour the broth through a strainer into a bowl to remove the solids. Place the broth into the refrigerator for 30 minutes to let the fat rise to the surface
* In the meantime, prepare the braising sauce. Start by grating the apple, onion, and ginger into a bowl, then add the remaining sauce ingredients and mix well until the sugar fully dissolves
* After the broth has been in the fridge for 30 minutes, you should see a layer of fat starting to form on the surface. Do your best and use a spoon to skim off this layer of fat. (Alternatively, you can pause at this step and leave the broth overnight in the fridge. This will ensure that the fat solidifies in a layer at the top of the broth, making it extremely easy to remove)
* Place the ribs and braising liquid back into the large pot and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, flipping the ribs a few times
* Pour the broth in and cover the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 45 minutes
* In the meantime, prepare the vegetables. Cut the potato, radish, and carrots into 1 inch pieces
* After 45 minutes, add the prepared radish and carrots to the pot. Make sure that they are mostly submerged in the liquid. After cooking for another 10 minutes, add the potatoes. Cook covered for another 20 minutes
* At this point, the rib meat should be extremely tender. Youll know its ready when you can easily pierce the meat with a chopstick. If you want the meat to be more tender, keep cooking covered until it reaches the desired tenderness
* Remove the lid and raise the heat back to medium. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the sauce has reduced and thickened to your liking. Remove from pot and serve immediately. Enjoy!",2768

# Instructions
1. Add glutinous rice to a large bowl and add water until the rice is completely submerged. Allow to soak for 2-4 hours. 
2. Drain the water and add rice to a food processor or blender. At 3 tbsp of water and grind for a minute.

This recipe was inspired by ""chipirones encebollados"" a traditional Spanish recipe for *squid with onions*. I only had cuttlefish instead of squid, and I also decided to use some leftover ingredients (sun-dried tomatoes and roasted peppers) to give take it up a notch. Feel free to take this as a template, and use other ingredients to create your own version!

If you liked this recipe, follow me on Instagram at ""food\_with\_alvaro"" for more recipes!

**Ingredients** (4 - 5 people)

* Around 500 g cuttlefish (I used frozen), cut into strips. You can use squid if you want.
* 4-5 white onions.
* 3 cloves of garlic
* \[Optional\] Feel free to choose whichever vegetables you fancy. I added some carrots, sun-dried tomatoes, and roast peppers
* 1 tablespoon of flour
* 1-1.5 glasses of white wine
* Water / stock (fish or veggie)
* Smoke paprika
* Extra virgin olive oil

**Steps**

1. Thinly slice the onions and slowly cook in a pan with plenty of olive oil for at least 15-20 min. The goal here is to almost caramelize the onion, not to get it crispy or golden.
2. If you are adding vegetables like onion, celery or leek, cook them alongside the onions.
3. Once the veg is soft, add the chopped garlic and cook for a few minutes.
4. Add the smoked paprika, cook for 1 min. Then, add the flour and cook it for a few minutes. 
5. Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Cook the alcohol away. Add water or stock until it covers all the vegetables. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.
6. Cut the cuttlefish into strips and put it in the pan. Let it cook slowly for at least 15 - 20 minutes. If too much water evaporates, correct it by adding some stock / water. Keep an eye on the cuttlefish, you want it to be soft. You can check this by pricking a piece with a fork
7. Remember, we are aiming for a ""saucy"" consistency, not ""soupy"" so don't add too much water. Once the cuttlefish is soft, add the sun-dried tomatoes and roasted peppers to the pan and let them mingle for 3-5 minutes. Remember to season to taste with salt and pepper.
8. Serve with your favourite side dish. Coconut rice would be a great choice.",2201

Ingredients

Spatchcock Chicken

3-4 lb raw whole chicken

2 tablespoons smoked paprika

1 ½ tablespoons dried oregano

1 tablespoon garlic powder

1 tablespoon kosher salt Diamond Crystal Kosher, if using another kosher salt use ½ tablespoon

1-2 tablespoons canola oil

1  1 ½ cups BBQ sauce

Roasted Vegetables

1 medium yellow onion

2 large carrots

½ pound baby yukon gold potatoes

1-2 tablespoons canola oil

Kosher salt to taste

1-2 cups low sodium chicken or vegetable broth


Instructions

Prepping the Chicken

Preheat the oven to 450 F and place a rack in the middle position.

In a small bowl, mix together smoked paprika, dried oregano, kosher salt and garlic powder, set aside.

Take the chicken from the packaging, drain any juices and remove anything in the cavity. Place on your sheet tray and pat dry with paper towels. Arrange the chicken so that the backbone is facing you. Using sharp kitchen shears, if desired, remove the wingtips at the joint and save for stock. Make one cut starting at the bottom (where the legs are) of the chicken and going towards the neck (where the wings are) on one side of the backbone. Youre going to cut through the ribcage but keep going. Repeat on the other side of the spine until its removed. Save for stock!

Open up the bird and flip it over so the skin is on top. Press down on the top of the breast to break the breast bone, making the bird lay down flatter.

Loosen the skin from the breast, thighs and legs gently with your fingers . Add the dry rub mixture under the skin all around the bird, trying to make sure each area is covered with dry rub, the meat should be well seasoned. You should use most of the dry rub on the meat and save roughly 1-2 teaspoons for the skin and get into all the nooks and crannies. Add 1-2 tablespoons of canola oil and rub into skin.

Position the chicken, skin side up in the center of a sheet tray. Arrange the legs so the thighs are exposed.

Preparing the Vegetables

Cut the onion in half through the root. Remove the top, root and skin of each half. Cut each half into 3-4 even pieces. Toss pieces lightly in canola oil and season well with kosher salt. Add to the sheet tray in 1 layer around the chicken.

Peel carrots and cut off the ends. Chop carrots up into even pieces about ½ inch to 1 inch in size. Toss lightly in canola oil and season well with kosher salt. Add to the sheet tray in 1 layer around the chicken.

Cut baby potatoes in half or quarters depending on the size and toss lightly in canola oil and season well with kosher salt. Add to the sheet tray in 1 layer around the chicken cut side down. It is okay if the vegetables are crowding around a bit, youre not looking for crispy edges.

Cooking the Sheet Pan Meal

Make sure all vegetables are in a single layer around the chicken. If using, add a meat thermometer alarm probe deep into the breast without touching bone, connect to the thermometer and set it to 120 F.

Carefully, place the sheet tray on the middle rack with the breast towards the front. Add enough broth to just cover the bottom of the sheet tray and cook for 20 minutes (or until 120 F alarm goes off).

After 20 minutes, slide out the sheet tray and add a light layer of BBQ sauce to the chicken skin with a pastry brush. Try to cover all visible skin and cook for 7 more minutes (or until 135 F internally). Add a little more chicken stock if you notice any dry spots on the sheet tray.

After 7 more minutes, slide out the sheet tray and add another light layer of BBQ sauce to the chicken. Cook until chicken breast registers 155 F internally or 10-13 minutes longer. Add a little more chicken stock if you notice any dry spots on the sheet tray.

If using an alarm probe, double check the temperature of the breast in a few spots and make sure thighs register at least 170 F. If youre not using a thermometer, check to see if the thigh removes easily from the rest of the chicken.

Once cooked, remove the sheet tray from the oven and rest chicken for at least 10 minutes. Check vegetables for doneness, they should be fork tender. If not, remove the chicken from the sheet tray to a cutting board and cook vegetables for 10 more minutes while the chicken rests.

Carve chicken as desired and serve with roasted vegetables.

Notes

The vegetable measurements are approximations.

If you dont have kitchen shears, ask your butcher to spatchcock the chicken for you.

Save the backbone and wingtips for stock plus leftover bones.

Make sure all vegetables and chicken are in a single layer to ensure even cooking.

It is easier to put the tray in the oven and then add the broth.

Chicken is cooked at an internal temperature of 155 F with a 10 minute rest or when the juices run clear and the thighs separate easily.

If using anything beside Diamond Crystal Kosher salt, use ½ of amount.

Store leftovers in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 3 days.",4981
2020-09-02,13,"Shrimp Pad Thai with homemade sauce","josephine9292","**INGREDIENTS (2 servings)**

100g dried rice noodles for Pad Thai

Shrimp, as much as you like

1.5 cup beansprouts

3-4 garlic chives

50g firm pressed tofu

2 eggs

1 medium shallot

2 garlic cloves

2 tbs shredded sweet preserved radish

1.5 tbs dried shrimps

2 tbs freshly roasted peanuts, skinned

1 lime

Chili flakes to taste

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for sauce:**

100 ml hot water

50g tamarind pulp (about 2.5 tbs)

40g palm sugar (about 3.5 tbs after shaving)

2.5 tbs fish sauce

Optional: 1/2 tbs Sriracha, for color and extra spice

&amp;#x200B;

**TIPS:**

\- Choose a wider type of rice noodle, it has better bite and less likely to break

\- Add a little bit more water to help cooking the noodles if needed

\- Chopping the dried shrimp will bring out more of its flavour, but they stick on the noodles and may be tiring to chew after a while.

\- If you plan to add more noodles or more ingredients, make more sauce, otherwise it will be pretty bland.

\- Always taste and adjust, since different brands of tamarind paste, fish sauce, palm sugar have very different level of salt/acid/sweetness.

\- There are 2 types of Thai preserved radish: salty, and sweet. Just check the label carefully.

\- For palm sugar, we need the light golden one, not the darker version.

\- Make more sauce and keep in the fridge for months!

\- You can substitute shrimp with chicken too.

&amp;#x200B;

**STEPS:**

**1. Preparing Pad Thai Sauce:**

\- Soak tamarind pulp in hot water. Stir and let sit for 20 mins. Strain and set aside.

\- Shave palm sugar disk, add to a sauce pan under low heat, stir.

\- When it is slightly caramelized, add tamarind mixture, continue to stir until dissolved then turn off the heat. Add fish sauce, mix and set aside.

\- Taste: a balance of sweet, sour, and salty.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Cooking Pad Thai:**

\- Soak dried noodle in cold water for at least 1 hour

\- Chop chives and tofu into 4cm length sticks

\- Roughly chop shallot, finely mince garlic

\- Finely chop sweet preserved radish.

\- Crush peanuts into medium chunks

\- Cut some lime wedges

\- In a large pan under medium heat, add 3 tbs of oil, fry shrimp until cooked, set aside.

\- Add shallot and garlic, fry until fragrant then add tofu, dried shrimp and preserved radish.

\- Add drained rice noodle and a little bit of water. Cook until soft then add sauce and mix.

\- Push the noodles to one side, add oil, crack 2 eggs

\- Break the yolks, spread them out and move the noodles on top of the eggs. Mix well.

\- Turn off the heat, add chives and beansprouts. Mix and let them cook in the remaining heat.

\- Add crushed peanuts, chili flakes to taste, and shrimps back.

\- Serve hot, garnish with extra bean sprouts, chives, lime wedges, some chili flakes, a little bit of sugar. Enjoy!!

# Equipment

&amp;#x200B;

* Wide Pot
* Large pot
* Medium Skillet

# Ingredients

**Spicy Rigatoni:**

* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
* 1 sweet onion peeled and sliced into thin wedges
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons capers drained
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper more or less to taste
* 1 cup white wine or chicken stock
* 1 cup chicken stock
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes quartered
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 16 ounces dry rigatoni
* 1 lemon juiced
* 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Scallops:**

* 1 pound dry-packed sea scallops muscle removed
* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Salt and pepper to taste

# Instructions

Start the Sauce:

* In a wide pot, heat the neutral cooking oil over medium heat until hot. Add the onion and cook for 5-6 minutes until just beginning to soften.
* Add the garlic, capers, and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

Deglaze the Pan:

* Add the white wine and chicken stock and bring to a boil.

Simmer the Sauce:

* Add the cherry tomatoes to the sauce and bring to a boil. Taste and season lightly with salt and pepper. The capers and chicken stock will lend a lot of salt to this recipe, so be careful with salting too heavily. Reduce heat and simmer as you prepare the rest of the meal.

Boil the Pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the rigatoni and cook for about 2-3 minutes under al dente.

Finish the Sauce:

* Pour the heavy cream into the sauce. Scoop out 1/3 cup pasta water from the rigatoni and add it to the sauce. Using a spider strainer, add the slightly undercooked rigatoni directly to the sauce. Bring to a very gentle bubble  not boiling, but slightly above a simmer. And cook for 5-7 minutes more until the sauce is very thick and the pasta is tender. Stir in the lemon juice and minced parsley. Taste and season again to your preference.

Sear the Scallops:

* Pat the scallops dry. Season lightly with salt and pepper and pat dry again.
* Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Melt the butter into the skillet. Once melted and frothy, add the scallops, without overcrowding the pan, and cook for 1-2 minutes until very well seared. Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes more until the scallops are opaque and cooked through.
* Turn off the heat on the scallops and immediately transfer the scallops on top of the pasta in the skillet. Turn off the heat.

To Serve:

* Divide the pasta and scallops between shallow bowls. Garnish with more minced parsley, if desired. Enjoy!

Recipe as follows and a link to a short video of the process below.

**Black Trumpet Tagliatelle**

Ingredients

430 g 00 Flour

20 g dehydrated wild mushroom powder

250 g eggs (beaten before mixing)

\*Portioned for 5 - 6 people

Directions

1. Using a spice grinder (or similar) blitz your dried mushrooms into a very fine powder. Here Im using black trumpets but you could easily substitute with any other edible wild mushroom.

2. Mix together the mushroom powder and flour into a bowl, and dump out onto your clean work surface.

3. Use your hand to form a well (like a volcano) in the center of the flour.

4. Carefully pour your eggs into the center and begin slowly mixing together with a fork. Gradually, carefully, work your way all around to incorporate the eggs with the flour, without breaking the outer wall.

5. After about 5 - 10 minutes it will start coming together into a shaggy mass. Begin using your hands to knead the dough together. Work diligently for another 5 minutes until it is no longer shaggy.

6. Use the edges of your hands, knuckles, to work the dough until it starts to form a smooth ball. Roll it, applying pressure, into the work surface. Fold it. Roll it again. After about ten minutes it should be a smooth, and ready to rest.

7. Cut the dough into two and wrap each in plastic wrap. Set into the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

8. The following steps revolve around using a pasta attachment on a Kitchenaid - but you could also do this by hand with a rolling pin. Remove one of the dough balls, unwrap, and cut off a portion of the dough. Lightly flour and cover the rest back with plastic. Press gently and form a rectangle.

9. Pass the dough through the sheet pasta attachment at its widest setting. If it feels sticky, add a little more flour. Gradually tighten the settings of the pasta attachment, one click at a time, and pass the pasta sheet through until it is light and delicate. For tagliatelle, I normally go to the 6th setting.

10. Allow the sheet of dough (sfoglia) to dry for 2-3 minutes and fold in half. With a knife, trim off irregular edges. Gently fold the dough into about 3 inch folds, over and over until you have a nice compact roll.

11. Using your knife, carefully begin cutting strips of the roll into about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) pieces. With your fingers, unroll each strip and sprinkle with a light coating of semolina. You can make little nests with each batch that is finished. Repeat until all of your dough has transformed unto tagliatelle.

12. Cook right away of store in the fridge covered with a towel.

2020-09-02,44,"Matcha Brownie Cookies","butfirstboba","INGREDIENTS

* 1/2 cup white chocolate
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter
* 1/3 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup dark brown sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 cup all purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 and 1/2 tbsp matcha powder
* pinch of salt
* black sesame seeds (topping)

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350F and line two baking trays with parchment paper
2. In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, matcha powder, and salt
3. In a microwave safe bowl, place the butter and white chocolate and microwave at 30 seconds intervals until the chocolate has completely melted. Stir to ensure that the butter and chocolate have combined smoothly (double boiler method is preferred for this)
4. Once the chocolate and butter mixture is combined, place off to the side to allow it to cool a bit as you prepare the rest of the cookie batter
5. In a large bowl, put in the egg and both sugars
6. Using an electric mixer, whisk together the egg and sugars on medium high speed for about 5 minutes (this time is important!)
7. With the mixer still on, pour in the chocolate butter mixture into the large bowl
8. Then add in the dry ingredients from the small bowl, into the large bowl (and, using the mixer, on medium high speed, whisk until everything is just combined, about 30-45 seconds)
9. Place a heaping tablespoon of cookie batter on two lined baking trays (5 per tray)
10. Top each cookie with a sprinkle of black sesame seeds
11. Put both trays in the oven, on the same level, and bake for \~15 minutes
12. Remove the trays from the oven and allow to cool for another 15 minutes before transferring to a wire rack, then enjoy!

Remember to follow the steps exactly and try to prep ahead of time because timing is KEY to getting the nice crinkle look! It's also best to bake all the cookie dough in one go because you don't want the dough to have any time to rest while the first batch is baking!

2020-09-01,37,"Thai Pork Stuffed Cucumber Soup","BushyEyes","**Recipe here originally:** [**Thai Pork Cucumber Soup**](https://triedtrue.us/PorkCucumberSoup)

Someone told me about Chrissy Teigans Thai pork stuffed cucumber soup and I knew I wanted to try making my own version of it. 

The woman who posted it to our group shared Chrissy Teigan's recipe and she said she felt like the version she ate growing up had more cilantro or spices in it. I did a little hunting and found a version on Cookpad by Kanya from Thailand which uses LOTS of cilantro. Kanya's version uses tofu, which I didnt have, so I omitted that.

Obviously, both versions are probably equally tasty, but I was definitely intrigued by the white pepper in the pork from Kanya's recipe, so that's what I used as my starting point.

This is a really easy recipe and a unique take on a really cheap veggie that most of us are probably swimming in this time of year!

# SUBSTITUTIONS:

Ground Pork: Ground chicken or ground turkey

Cucumber: Seedless or seeded, doesn't matter

Ground White Pepper: Use black pepper instead  it won't have exactly the same flavor, but it's ok.

You can follow Kanya's method and add tofu to it, as well!

# RECIPE

## Equipment

* Large pot

## Ingredients

## Pork Mixture

* 1 pound ground pork
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* ½ tablespoon sesame oil
* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
* ¼ cup fresh cilantro leaves and stems minced (see note)

## Cucumber Soup:

* 2 large cucumbers
* 6 cups water or low-sodium chicken stock
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* ½ tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 bunch cilantro stems minced (see note)
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 scallion minced; white and green parts separated
* Salt, to taste
* Sesame seeds optional, for garnish

## Instructions

## Prepare the Broth:

* Combine the water, soy sauce, sesame oil, minced cilantro stems, black pepper, sriracha, and white part of the scallion in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

## Prepare the Cucumbers:

* Peel the cucumbers and cut into three or four pieces depending on the length. Using the back of a spoon, hallow out the seeds and discard them. Set aside.

## Prepare the Pork Mixture:

* In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the pork and mix until well-combined.

## Stuff the Cucumbers:

* Carefully stuff the cucumbers with the pork. Roll any remaining pork into small meatballs.

## Boil the Cucumbers:

* Turn the heat on the broth to a vigorous simmer. Carefully drop the cucumbers and meatballs into the soup and cook for about 15-20 minutes until the pork is completely cooked through and the cucumbers have softened. Turn off the heat.

## To Serve:

* Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with extra cilantro leaves, minced green part of the scallion, and sesame seeds. Enjoy!

## Notes

*In this recipe, you can use 1* [*small*](https://www.wikihow.com/video/f/fd/Chop%20Cilantro%20Step%207%20Version%202.360p.mp4) *bunch of cilantro. Cut the cilantro right beneath where the bunch becomes leafy and mince the stems. Use about 1/4 cup of the leaves for the meatballs and use any remaining cilantro as garnish. If you have a very large bunch,  just use discretion on how much cilantro you want to use!*

* Swipe bread through grease and toast one side
* Prep cheese with mayo - set them on the cutting board with enough overlap to cover the whole piece of bread. Liberally add mayo edge to edge. 
* Add more oil to the pan, flip bread and drag through oil with tongs; immediately lay mayo side of cheese on bread
* Slice steaks against the grain
* Place steaks on top of un-cheesed bread; top with onions, mushrooms. 
* There should be a good amount of juice in the bowl. Dump that shit on your sandwiches before topping with the cheesy piece of bread (cheese side down, duh).

2020-09-01,30,"Sopa Castellana / Traditional Castilian Bread Soup","AlvaroMenduina","**Sopa Castellana / Castilian Bread Soup**

This is a very traditional Spanish soup that makes use of leftover bread, and tons of garlic. It started as a peasant dish, but now it's a staple dish of Castilla y Leon, one of the central regions of Spain. A delicious, comforting dish, for the autumn and winter months.

If you like this recipe, please follow me on Instagram at ""food\_with\_alvaro""

**Ingredients**

This recipe can be easily scaled up depending on how many portions you want to make. For 1-2 people, I suggest: 

* 1 - 2 slices of leftover stale bread (something rustic like a sourdough loaf is ideal)
* Extra virgin olive oil (be generous)
* A lot of garlic. Depending on your preference, but try to keep it heavy on the garlic.
* 1-2 tablespoons of Smoked paprika. Ideally ""Pimenton de la Vera""
* 500 - 750 ml of stock, whichever you prefer. I used stock made with leftover Jamon bones.
* 1 egg per person
* \[Optional\] Some tiny Jamon bites, usually leftovers from a leg of Jamon.

**Directions**

1. \[Optional\] You can start by lightly frying some garlic to sprinkle on top at the end. 
2. In a sauce pan, start by frying chopped garlic, be careful not to burn it. Before it gets brown, add the chopped bread (and the jamon if you have it) and saute for a few minutes.
3. Reduce the heat and add the smoked paprika. Be careful because it burns very easily. After 30 seconds, add the stock.
4. Bring it to a boil, and then let it simmer for 5 - 10 min, depending on the size and hardness of the stale bread. After that time, taste the soup and season to taste with salt.
5. Finish the dish by cracking the eggs into the soup. You can either stir it to break the eggs into tiny pieces, or let them poach slowly (like I did). They will be ready in a couple of minutes.",1787

&amp;#x200B;

[Click here for a full video with detailed instructions.](https://youtu.be/1Kp9gzLRoaA)

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

Beef soup:

1. Wash and clean 2lb beef. Turn on the high heat and boil the beef in cold water. Add 4-5 ginger slices and 1oz Chinese cooking wine. Turn down the heat to medium when boiling. Boil for 15 min and get rid of beef scum.
2. Dump the water and let the beef cool down. Cut it into cubes.
3. Chop a half onion and prepare dry spices.
4. In a big pot, stir fry dry spices in 3 tbsps oil in medium heat for 2 min. Then stir fry chopped onions for 2 min. Add beef and stir fry for 2 minutes. Then add chili bean paste and stir fry everything for 2 minutes.
5. In the same pot, add 1.2L boiling water, 2 tbsps soy sauce, 1 tbsp dark soy sauce, 3g salt. Simmer for 2 hours in low heat.

Hand pulled noodles:

1. Mix flour, salt and water together to make a dough. The ratio of flour to water is 1:0.6. Rest for 30 minutes.
2. After resting, knead the dough for 2 minutes, and rest for another 30 min.
3. Brush some oil on the work surface, roll out the dough to 0.5 inch thick. Brush more oil on both sides to keep its moisture, cover it with a plastic wrapper. Rest for 2-3 hours.
4. Cut the dough into 0.5 inch strips. Stretch and slap the noodle on the work surface.
5. Boil the fresh noodles for 1.5 min. Boil some baby bok choy for 30 seconds.
6. Add chopped garlic and green onions to finish off the perfect bowl of braised beef noodle soup!

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. Resting the dough is the key of making hand pulled noodles. The dough will develop gluten by itself and become elastic.
2. Salt not only provides flavor, but also strengthens gluten bonding.
3. Slapping the noodle on the work surface can help it stretch evenly.

&amp;#x200B;

This dish is super delicious and well-balanced. The noodle is chewy, beef is soft and savory, the broth is steaming hot and packed with flavors. It looks time-consuming, but mostly you just need to wait for the soup to gain flavors and for the dough to form gluten. It is not hard work, and the payoff is absolutely worth it!",2672

Recipe:

Ingredients:

2 cups of flour

1 teaspoon baking soda

2 teaspoons cornstarch

1 teaspoon salt

2 sticks of butter 

1 cup dark brown sugar, lightly packed

½ cup granulated sugar

2 large eggs plus 1 yolk

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

8 oz of chocolate or 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips


Equipment:

Hand-mixer/ Stand-mixer

Cookie Sheets

Parchment paper/silicone mats


Steps:


In a medium saucepan, add 2 sticks of butter, quartered. Melt over medium until butter turns brown. Set aside and let cool.

In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt. Set aside.

In a large bowl, beat together the cooled browned butter and the sugars with a hand-mixer/ stand-mixer for about one minute. Then, add in the eggs and vanilla extract. Beat until just combined.
Slowly add in the dry ingredients and mix briefly, just until there are no flour clumps left. Fold in the chocolate chips or 8 oz of chopped up chocolate. 
Cover and refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes to an hour.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and preheat the oven to 350°F, making sure you have the racks in the middle of the oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

Scoop 1/4 cup of cookie dough at a time and roll into balls. Then, tear the balls in half by pulling gently on both sides. Smush the two halves together again, but this time have the irregular, torn sides face upward. Place on the prepared baking sheet, making sure the cookies have plenty of space to spread. You should be able to fit 4 cookies on each tray.

Bake for about 12-18 minutes, rotating half-way through, or until the cookies have spread out and the edges are golden, but the centers of the cookies still look soft and undercooked. Halfway through cooking, pick up the cookie sheets and drop them back onto the oven rack so the baking soda bubbles pop. This will create a chewier cookie. Every oven is different, so I recommend starting with just one or two cookies on the tray to see what baking time works best for you!

Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets until the cookies are firm enough to remove, about 15 minutes. 


Repeat with remaining batches, until all cookies are baked. Enjoy with a cold glass of milk!",2279

2020-08-29,34,"Raspberry Pancakes (Recipe)","MathWizPatentDude","Your question is valid, and this recipe is defective in this regard. Further, it is not a really good recipe. A general pancake dry:wet:egg ratio should be around 1:1:1, but will often work using 2:2:1. This recipe drifts from this ratio significantly, and it suffers for it. I was hoping to gain a bit of moisture from the frozen raspberries I used, but did not gain anything that made a difference.

I actually made this recipe this morning, gluten free (wife is celiac). I use my own blend of GF flour; I do not buy these ""1-for-1"" GF mixes. GF flour takes considerably more fluid to properly hydrate compared to wheat flour, so this made the recipe even more difficult to deal with. I added the eggs with the wet ingredients, to the dry, like any normal pancake recipe dictates.

This batter was far too thick to work with properly, and the considerable amount of sugar in the mix caused far too much caramelizing during cooking. It was a disaster, and I was barely able to recover by twice adding more fluid the batter. Further, cooking each set of pancakes for 6-8 minutes each is a nightmare if you follow the instructions. 

In the end, I almost tripled the amount of milk in this recipe to get a batter that would work for me. I strongly suggest experimenting with your own concoctions, particularly with simple fruit additions like this one, in accordance with one or more general pancake recipes [like this one](https://food52.com/blog/10651-how-to-make-pancakes-without-a-recipe). While these food blog pictures (always) look amazing, the end result is typically far from what any home cook should expect.",1617

### Equipment

* Wide pot
* Baking sheet

### Ingredients

#### Brothy Beans:

* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
* 1 large shallot peeled and sliced into rounds
* 1 pound baby red potatoes quartered
* 8 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 cup dry white wine
* 3 cups low-sodium chicken stock
* 15 ounce can great northern beans drained and rinsed
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more to taste, if desired
* ½ teaspoon dry thyme
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Branzino:

* 2 whole branzino scaled and gutted (or use trout, red snapper, or tilapia)
* 1 lemon sliced into rounds
* 1 lemon cut into wedges
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Dry or freshly minced parsley optional, for serving

### Instructions

#### Start the Brothy Beans:

* Preheat oven to 450ºF.
* Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 3-5 minutes until softened and beginning to brown. Add the potatoes and cook an additional 3-5 minutes until just beginning to brown. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 45 seconds.
* Melt the butter into the pot. Once melted and frothy, deglaze with white wine and bring to a boil.

#### Season and Simmer the Brothy Beans:

* Pour in the chicken stock and beans and bring to a boil. Season with crushed red pepper, thyme, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to a vigorous simmer for 20-25 minutes until the liquid has reduced by about half. If the liquid reduces too quickly, turn the heat to low and continue simmering until the potatoes are fork-tender. Taste and season again to taste.

#### Roast the Branzino:

* While the beans simmer, roast the branzino. Pat the fish dry and rub all over with extra virgin olive oil. Season liberally with salt and pepper  all over both sides and inside the cavity of the fish. Place lemon slices inside the cavity of the fish. Place any excess lemon rounds on the baking sheet. Prop the fish up, cavity-side down, and use lemon wedges to stand the fish up. Transfer to the oven for 22-25 minutes. If desired, broil the skin briefly until very crispy.

#### To Serve:

* Ladle the brothy beans into shallow bowls and place a branzino fish on top. Garnish with dry or freshly minced parsley, if desired. Drizzle with a touch of extra virgin olive oil. Enjoy!

2020-08-28,1,"Fruit Cake Friday!","ASliceOfScribe","It's probably a bit early yet for these making a traditional appearance, but this recipe is so good had to share. It's [Alton Brown's](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/free-range-fruitcake-recipe-1926833) and I'm never making a fruitcake a different way ever again. 

**Ingredients**

* 1 C Golden Raisins
* 1 C Currants
* 1/2 C Sun Dried Cranberries
* 1/2 C Sun Dried Blueberries
* 1/2 C Dried Apricots, chopped
* Zest of one lemon, chopped coarsely
* Zest of one orange, chopped coarsely
* 1/4 C candied ginger, chopped
* 1 C Gold Rum
* 1 C Sugar
* 5 Ounces Unstaled Butter
* 1 C Unfiltered Apple Juice
* 4 whole cloves, ground
* 6 allspice berries, ground
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp ground ginger
* 1 3/4 C AP Flour
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 C Toasted Pecans, broken
* Brandy for basting

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions**

1. Combine dried fruits, candied ginger and both zests. Add rum and macerate overnight, or microwave for 5 minutes to re-hydrate fruit
2. Place fruit and liquid in a non-reactive pot with sugar, butter, apple juice and spices. Bring to a boil stirring often, then reduce heat and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
3. Heat oven to 325f
4. Combine dry ingredients and sift into fruit mixture. Quickly bring batter together with large wooden spoon, then stir in eggs one at a time until completely integrated. Then fold in nuts. Spoon into a 10-inch non-stick loaf pan and bake for 1 hour. Check doneness by inserting a toothpick into the middle of the cake. If it comes out clean you're done.
5. Place on cooling rack. Baste or spritz top with brandy and allow to cool completely before turning out from pan.
6. When completely cooled, store in a tight sealing food safe container. Ever 2 - 3 days, feel the cake and if dry, spritz with brandy. The cakes flavour will enhance considerably over the next two weeks. If you decide to give the cake as a gift, be sure to tell the recipient that they are very lucky, indeed.

**Notes**

* I rarely end up having to baste the cake too much, as it is consumed far before it makes it to the two week mark. Only time it doesn't is when I make two cakes at once!
* I grease my non-stick pan with mandarin orange infused oil for this, gives the crust an extra hit of orange.
* For the zest, I actually use a potato peeler and get whole chunks of zest. Chopped up it softens properly in the cake. So good. Shouldn't get much of the white of the skin when zesting.
* I prefer using dark rum for this, I use Kraken. A) I have it in my house already and B) I prefer a really dark rum!
* When I'm looking to indulge a bit extra, I put butter on a slice and toss it onto a heated pan. Morning coffee will never be the same.

The italian that made the original imgur post has some more details but here's a recap:

Ingredients:

\- Four egg yolks + 1 egg

\- 100 g/a half cup of grated Pecorino Romano cheese or parmigiano cheese. it's very important that you pick just this two kind of cheese.

\- 150g/5.5 oz of diced guanciale (pork jowl or cheeks) or a good quality smoky bacon

\- 320g/12 oz of spaghetti (Barilla it's ok)

\- Freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:

\- Wisk together the eggs

\- Whisk finely grated cheese into the eggs

\- Add pepper

\- Fry bacon in it's own fat, medium heat. Let cool

\- Boil Spaghetti a minute shorter than the instruction

\- Use spaghetti water to adjust egg mix to right viscosity, or just don't drain it that good

Recipe (50 egg rolls)

* Pastry Roll papers (50)
* Rice Vermicelli (200 grams)
* Ground Pork Lean/Fat (2lbs/.5 lbs)
* Shrimp (3/4 pound)
* Taro (1 medium size)
* Carrot (1 very large size)
* Eggs ( 2 large size)
* Salt / White Pepper / Sugar ( 2.5 tsp / 2 tsp / .5 tsp )
* Soy Sauce (1.5 tbl)
* Fish Sauce (1.5 tbl)
* Oyster Sauce (2 tbl)
* Corn Starch (2 tbl)
* Sesame Oil (2 tbl)

Instructions

1. Soak vermicelli in hot water for at least 30 minutes, then strain well. Roughly cut and set it to the side. Shrimp: Peel, cut alongside spine and wash to get rid of any imperfections. Smash the shrimp then roughly mince. Peel Carrot and Taro and use a food grater to cut into pieces into a large bowl which we will use to mix.
2. Add the vermicelli, shrimp, pork  and eggs into the bowl of carrots and throw in all the spices (except Sesame Oil and Corn Starch). Give it a good mixing with a spatula until well combined.
3. Add in the Sesame Oil and Corn Starch and do a final mixing with your hands, optionally transfer into a smaller bowl and store it in the fridge.
4. Separate all Pastry papers and also make a mixture of flour and water to use as glue for the egg rolls. Use about 1.5 tbl of our mixture for each egg roll. (See video for visual representation of how to roll the egg rolls)
5. Fry on a medium heat for 7-10 minutes, then take them back out. Re-heat the oil to a medium high heat and re-fry the egg rolls for another 2-3 minutes. (Be sure to move them around occasionally to avoid burning)
6. Dip with your favorite dipping sauces (mine is definitely Chinese hot mustard) and enjoy to your heart's content.

If you wish to store these for another time, freeze them on a plate with saran wrap making sure they are not touching. Once they are frozen you can transfer them into a bag and store in freezer for a long time. Take them out, let them defrost and fry them whenever you wish to eat.",2243

Maiale al Latte (Milk-Braised Pork)

INGREDIENTS

4 lb. skinless, boneless pork shoulder, cut into two 2-lb. pieces

Kosher salt

3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil

2 heads of garlic, cut in half crosswise

6 cups whole milk

4 bunches sage (about 20 leaves) or a mix of rosemary sprigs, thyme sprigs, and/or bay leaves

2 chiles de árbol or ¾ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes

4 2"" strips lemon peel

2 Tbsp. very finely chopped parsley

Freshly ground black pepper

RECIPE PREPARATION

Season pork generously with salt all over. Let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour, or preferably chill overnight, then let sit at room temperature 1 hour before cooking.

Preheat oven to 300°. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy wide saucepan over medium-high. Add garlic, cut sides down, and cook until golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer garlic to a plate. Add pork to pot and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown, 35 minutes. Turn and cook, reducing heat to medium if needed so it doesn't burn, until golden brown on all sides, another 35 minutes.

Return pork and garlic to pot. Add milk, sage, chiles, and lemon peel. Transfer pot to oven and bake, uncovered, turning pork every 30 minutes, until meat is very tender and can easily be pierced with a paring knife and milk has reduced and formed curds, 2½3 hours. Transfer meat to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes.

Using a spoon, skim off most of the fat from the braising liquid; discard sage and lemon peel. Taste sauce and season with salt, if desired.

Slice pork and transfer to a platter. Arrange roasted garlic alongside pork, if desired. Spoon sauce over. Top with parsley; season with pepper.",1749

Deliciously creamy, great taste of jamon, and a crispy breading. Definitely one of the quintessential Spanish tapas, and a hot topic of debate as everyone believes their mum / grandma's croquetas are the best!

It can be a bit tricky and overwhelming the first time you make them, but the more you practice, the more you'll love them.

If you liked this recipe and want to get more Spanish recipes, follow me on Instagram (@food\_with\_alvaro)

**INGREDIENTS** \[Makes 24-30\]

For the bechamel:

* 100 g butter
* 100 g flour
* 1 litre of whole milk
* 1 medium-size onion
* 100 - 150 g of Spanish jamon, in small cubes, or chopped finely
* Nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste

For the breading:

* Flour
* 1-2 eggs (beaten)
* Breadcrumbs
* Oil to fry them (preferably olive oil, but can use sunflower)

**DIRECTIONS**

1. Get a big saucepan for the bechamel. Melt the butter (add a touch of olive oil to prevent burning), chop the onion and cook gently in the butter. This should take around 10 min. Once the onion is soft and slightly golden, add the jamon, cook for 1-2 min.
2. Time for the bechamel. Add the flour and cook for a few minutes. Once it's cooked, start adding the milk and whisk to avoid lumps. Incorporate all the milk. Add the nutmeg.
3. Important! You have to cook down the bechamel quite a lot until it thickens. Otherwise it will be impossible to form the croquetas (they'll be too liquidy...). So be very patient and let the bechamel simmer while whisking for around 20 min.
4. Once the bechamel is thick to the point that it's a bit hard to whisk, it should be ready. Remember to season to taste with salt and butter. Don't go too heavy on the salt, the jamon is already salty. Pour the bechamel into a tupperware / oven dish to cool down. You could do this overnight, or even freeze the mixture for a rainy day.
5. **Croquetas time!** Get 3 small bowls and fill them up with: *flour*, *beaten eggs* and *breadcrumbs*. Get the cold bechamel from the fridge, and start by scooping some of the mixture with your hands. Roll it into a ball / oval croqueta shape.
6. Coat and dust it with flour so that the egg sticks. Put in into the beaten egg bowl, and then into the breadcrumbs bowl. You should end up with a nice coated croqueta ready to fry. Repeat this for as many croquetas as you can possibly eat.
7. Finally deep fry them in a pan with hot (but not too hot) oil. It should take a few minutes and you can do them in batches. Take them out when they are nice and golden. Pour them onto a plate with some kitchen paper to drain the excess oil. And they are ready to go. They should be creamy on the inside, and crunchy on the outside.",2717

**Ingredients**

*Peanut Butter Filling*

* 1 C creamy peanut butter

* 1/2 C powdered sugar

*Cookie Dough*

* 1.5 C cake flour

* 1.75 C all purpose flour

* 1 tbsp corn starch

* 1/2 tsp baking soda

* 2 tsp kosher salt

* 1.25 C softened unsalted butter

* 1.25 C brown sugar

* 1/2 C white granulated sugar

* 2 eggs

* 3 egg yolks

* 2 tsp vanilla

* 12oz semi-sweet chocolate chips

**Preparation**

1. In a small bowl, mix together the peanut butter and powdered sugar until smooth. Dont worry if there are a few powdered sugar lumps left over.

2. Pass the mixture between two spoons to make small balls - about 1 inch in diameter.

3. Place the balls on a parchment lined plate and freeze for at least 30 minutes.

4. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, corn starch, baking soda and salt. Whisk to combine and set aside.

5. Using the whisk attachment on a stand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar by mixing on medium speed for a few minutes until light and fluffy.

6. Beat in the eggs and egg yolks one at a time, then the vanilla and mix until fully incorporated.

7. Switch to the paddle attachment and begin adding in the dry ingredients (step 4) in increments. About 1/4 of the total volume at a time.

8. Pour 12oz of semi-sweet (milk or dark chocolate work fine too!) chocolate chips into the bowl and mix on low speed until evenly incorporated.

9. Take ~4oz of cookie dough and pat it out flat in your hand. Place a peanut butter ball into the center and wrap the dough around it making sure to close up any cracks.

10. Place the cookies on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper or silicone baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This helps them keep their shape and not melt into thin cookies.

11. While your cookies are chilling, preheat your oven to 425 degrees F.

12. Bake your cookies for 10-12 minutes and let them cool for about 30 minutes (or eat them immediately and burn your mouth like I did).",2065

2020-08-27,83,"Faworki - Polish Crunchy Deep Fried Pastries","mienczaczek","Sweet, crunchy and melts in the mouth. This deep-fried pastry is definitely one of my favourite sweets from childhood usually prepared by my dear grandmother. Sometimes made on special occasions like Fat Thursday or on a rainy day to make it a little bit brighter. They are also called ""Chrust"" meaning wooden twigs resembling their fragileness and texture.

**Ingredients:**

* 400g (14.1oz) of sieved pastry flour
* 6tbsp of sour cream
* 6 egg yolks
* 2tbsp of 95% alcohol (40% minimum)
* pinch of salt
* 1L (1quart) of oil for deep frying
* icing sugar for dusting

**Method:**

1.In the bowl mix flour, salt, cream, yolks, alcohol and by using a spatula.

2. Once wet and dry ingredients combine, bring it to a ball shape with your hands (you may need to add a little bit more cream if it looks to dry).

3. The dough will be too hard to knead by hands, we gonna use a rolling pin beating method. Hit the dough with a rolling pin until flat and then turn on the other side and fold. Do this for around 10 minutes until the dough looks smooth.

4. Once ready, rest the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes (you can wrap it to prevent drying).

5. Next, divide the dough into 4 parts, roll each part as thin as possible to get the best crunch (I have not used any flour for rolling)

6. Cut rolled dough vertically to get equal strings (3,5cm thick (1.4inch)) you can use a wheel cutter or a knife to do so.

7. Cut each string into 2-3 equal pieces (10-15cm long (4-6inch)) cuts can be made at an angle so the Faworki looks the best. In each piece cut a hole (3-4cm (1.2-1.6inch)).

8. To finish put one end of the piece inside the hole and pull through, this will give you their final shape. Place covered on the cloth to prevent from frying, ready for the deep frying.

9. To deep-fry heat the oil to 200C (392F) and fry few at the time flipping upside down with a fork to cook on both sides until golden brown. When ready place on the kitchen towel to remove excess fat and cool on a rack. Dust with icing sugar before serving.

**Insight:**

* When the pastry hits the hot oil alcohol evaporates quickly preventing the dough from absorbing the oil giving you crunchy and healthier product.
* This recipe originated in the ancient times of the Roman Empire and can be found across Europe in different variations.

You want all the flavour and collagen you can get. The keel bone alone will not make a darker stock. If you roast your chicken bones before making stock you will get a darker stock.

However, if you are making a light consomme then you do not want a dark stock, would not roast your chicken or allow it to boil (so it won't be cloudy).",436

### INGREDIENTS

* 1 cup instant coffee (use double the recommended amount of coffee grounds recommended on the packaging)
* 4 tablespoons brandy/cognac (or dark rum; divided in half)
* 16 ladyfingers (enough to fill the entire bottom of your baking tray twice)
* 4 egg yolks (MAKE SURE YOU BUY PASTEURIZED EGGS)
* 8 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar (105g)
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 cup mascarpone (227g)
* Cocoa powder (for dusting the top)

### DIRECTIONS

* Mix instant coffee and 2 tablespoons of brandy. Using half of the ladyfingers, quickly dip both sides of each ladyfinger in the mixture and place on the bottom of the baking tray. You might need to break some of the ladyfingers to completely fill the layer (it doesnt have to be tightly packed but there shouldnt be much space between the ladyfingers
* In a larger bowl, whip together the egg yolks and 1/4 cup (50g) of sugar (either with whisk or hand mixer). Stop when the mixture is thickened enough that it falls in ribbons from the whisk when you lift it up. The ribbons should remain visible on the surface of the mixture for a second before it reintegrates
* In a separate bowl, whip together the heavy cream and remaining sugar (55g) until medium peaks form. Add mascarpone and 2 tablespoons of brandy and keep whipping until it creates a smooth mixture
* Gently fold the cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture until combined using a silicone spatula. Be careful not to over-mix or press too hard while mixing
* Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the prepared ladyfingers in the baking tray
* Dip the remaining ladyfingers in the coffee mixture one at a time and arrange into a layer on top of the mascarpone cream. Spread the rest of the mascarpone cream on top of the ladyfingers and dust a thick layer of cocoa powder on top
* Leave in refrigerator for at least 8 hours to let the flavors fully integrate. Enjoy!

### Equipment

* Large pot
* Wide skillet

### Ingredients

* 1 pound chicken breasts boneless, skinless or bone-in, skin-on
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper trimmed and diced; or use crushed red pepper
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes
* 1 cup dry white wine or use chicken stock
* 1½ cups heavy cream
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 16 ounces elbows
* 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves torn, a few leaves reserved for garnish
* 1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Parboil the Chicken:

* Fill a large pot with water and salt liberally. Add the chicken and bring to a low boil. Cook, removing any scum from the surface, for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is mostly cooked through.
* Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and dice into bite-sized pieces. Discard skin and bones if using bone-in, skin-on. Keep the water in the large pot on low heat.

#### Sauté Aromatics:

* When the chicken is nearly done boiling, begin sautéing the aromatics. Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a wide skillet over medium heat.
* Add the onion and cook, stirring often, for 8-10 minutes until softened and well-browned. Adjust the heat as needed to prevent it from burning. Add the minced chili pepper and minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

#### Brown the Chicken:

* Add the diced chicken to the skillet and season everything with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat, tossing regularly, until the chicken is browned. Transfer everything in the skillet to a large bowl.

#### Cook the Tomatoes:

* Melt 2 tablespoons butter into the skillet and add the tomatoes. Cook, turning regularly, for 5-7 minutes until the skins begin to split. Pour in the white wine or chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium for 5 minutes until reduced. Season with salt and pepper.

#### Warm the Cream:

* Pour the cream into a heat proof bowl or measuring glass and microwave in 45 second increments until warmed through.
* Add the flour to the cream and whisk until incorporated. Set aside.

#### Finish the Sauce:

* Return the chicken and aromatics to the skillet with the tomatoes. Turn the heat to low. Pour in the white wine mixture and bring to a very low boil. Season again with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5-10 minutes, stirring regularly, until thickened. Taste and season again.

#### Boil the Macaroni:

* Return the pot of water to a boil. Add the elbows and cook until al dente. Drain and return to the pot. Return the pot to the stove and pour the chicken and sauce over top and toss to combine. Turn the heat to low for 3-5 minutes. Add the grated parmesan and basil leaves and toss to combine. Continue stirring over very low heat for an additional minute or two until the elbows are well-coated. Turn off the heat.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the cooked chicken mac and cheese between bowls. Garnish with thinly sliced basil leaves, if desired. Enjoy!

**Ingredients for Chocolate Concrete (Recipe makes 12 Slices).**

* Self Raising Flour- 227g
* Butter - 170g
* Sugar - 170g

1. Mix Together Sugar, Flour and Cocoa powder. Then add Browned Butter, an Egg and vanilla extract.
2. Mix until wet cement consistency.
3. Place baking paper into a greased cake tin and place the mixture in (We used 2 small tins). Push down until compact and spread across the tin.
4. Bake for 15-20 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius.
5. Sprinkle with sugar immediately after coming out and cut into 12 pieces (We cut each of our two tins into 6). Cutting while still hot as if you allow them to cool they'll break apart when trying to cut them.
6. Cool on a cooling rack completely until hard. Serve on their own or with custard/Ice cream.

*Serves 4-6*

I saw this recipe in a cook-book for Le Creuset pots and I decided to give it a go. It was delicious, airy and fluffy so I'm sharing it with you. You need something like a round casserole / dutch oven. Not too big (18 - 28 cm).

If you like this recipe, I have an Instagram with other recipes! user\_name: ""food\_with\_alvaro""

**INGREDIENTS**

For the bechamel:

* 25 g butter
* 25 g flour
* 250 g milk
* nutmeg, salt, pepper, to taste

For the pea puree:

* 500 g frozen peas
* 1 handful of basil (you can add mint if you like!)
* 2 eggs
* Parmesan cheese
* Pine nuts (you can skip this, or add other nuts you like)

**STEPS**

1. Boil the kettle and pour it over a bowl of frozen peas. Drain after 5 minutes, mix with the basil and puree with a food processor / blender until smooth and bright green. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Make a bechamel. Melt the butter in a saucepan over low / medium heat. Add the flour, whisk and cook for a few minutes. Add the milk, little by little, while whisking to avoid getting clumps of flour. After the milk is incorporated, bring to low simmer and let it thicken slightly for a few minutes. Season to taste with salt, nutmeg and black pepper. Let it cool down completely!
3. Separate the egg whites and the yolks. Mix the egg yolk and Parmesan cheese, into the pea puree. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Fold very carefully with a spatula into the pea puree. Do not whisk it or you will lose all the airyness of the egg whites! Do it gently to get a fluffly souffle.
4. Grease the inside of a deep casserole dish with butter and dust the sides with flour. This will allow the souffle to rise properly. Carefully pour the souffle mixture into the casserole dish. Sprinkle the pine nuts on top and grate some extra Parmesan cheese. Cook in the oven at 180C for 45-60 min until puffed up. To check if it is ready, shake the casserole, the souffle shouldnt wiggle too much; then, prick the centre with a knife and if it comes out dry and clean, the souffle is ready. Take it out and serve immediately, otherwise it will deflate :(",2154

2020-08-24,1,"Cast Iron Skillet Pizza","ASliceOfScribe","I've been cooking a lot more pizza lately. A little farmer's market is open during the summer on my way home from work so I'll swing by on a Friday before the weekend to get some ingredients for Pizza.

I make the pizza dough up at around 9 or 10, same time I roast the tomatoes. Gives me time to go about my Saturday and time for the dough to rise and be delicious.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dough**

* 200g AP White Flour
* 50g Buckwheat Flour**^(1)**
* 175g water
* 5g salt
* 1/8 tsp yeast**^(2)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions**

* Mix**^(3)** Flour and Water. Let rest for half an hour. Add salt and yeast.
* Stretch and fold mixture at least once in the first hour.
* Let rise for 6 hours, or about double in size.
* Form into ball and stretch into desired shape. I'll usually hand shape my dough as I find it's easier to avoid degassing it.
* Turn oven on at 500f. Place Cast Iron Skillet into oven to heat. After 30 minutes, remove from oven, sprinkle some cornmeal on the pan, and lay out the dough over the skillet. Layer ingredients at your fancy.
* Cook in oven for \~8 minutes.
* Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes**

1. Buckwheat flour is not necessary, 100% AP flour will do just fine. It just makes the ideal dough for me!
2. If you need it to rise faster, you can up the yeast amount. I find the longer you let it develop the better the dough tastes, so when you can afford not to, let it take it's time.
3. I mix by hand, no reason a machine mixer wouldn't do the job.

Sauce is just tomatoes halved and seeded, roasted at 425f for 2 hours with olive oil, kocher salt and coarse black pepper, then hit with the immersion blender. I like a saucy pizza, but not a slip and slide pizza, so I'll simmer the sauce for as long as I can to really thicken it up. Best of both worlds.

5. Turn on to medium heat and bring to a boil all the while whisking (it's important to keep whisking the mixture as it firms up so none of it sticks to the bottom of the sauce pot)
6. Whisking while the mixture is boiling for 1 minute before removing from heat and then mix in the ube extract
7. Transfer the pastry cream to a separate container (**optional**: first strain it through a mesh sieve to ensure the cream has a really smooth consistency)
8. Cover the pastry cream with plastic wrap, ensuring that the plastic wrap touches the top of the pastry cream to discourage the formation of a skin on top of it
9. Place in refrigerator and chill for at least 2 hours before using

**Ube Craqueline**

1. Soften the butter and ensure it is nice and fluffy
2. Mix in the ube extract into the softened butter mixture
3. Add in the all purpose flour, brown sugar, and salt into the butter and mix together until thoroughly combined
4. Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and flatten until the dough reaches about 1/4 inch thickness
5. Freeze the dough until ready for use

**Choux Pastry**

1. Pour the water, sugar, salt, and butter into a sauce pot and heat over medium heat
2. Stir the mixture together until the water is boiling and the butter is melted
3. Remove the sauce pot from the stove at this point and dump in all the flour in one go
4. Vigorously mix the flour into the butter/water mixture so that all the water is absorbed
5. Once the dough is formed, return the sauce pot to heat and continue to mix and cook down the dough until it pulls away from the sides of the pot and you're able to stick a spoon into it and have it stand straight up (about 2-5 minutes)
6. Transfer the dough to a bowl and let it cool down for a couple minutes
7. Crack in the eggs one at a time, ensuring the previous egg is fully incorporated into the dough before adding in the next egg
8. Transfer the dough into a piping bag (or a ziplock bag with a small hole cut at the corner)

**Assembly**

1. Preheat the oven to 375F and line a baking tray with parchment paper
2. Remove the craqueline topping from the freezer and cut out disks of a desired size (about 2 inches in diameter or larger) to put on top of the choux pastry
3. Pipe out mounds of choux pastry onto the prepared baking tray and top each mound with a craqueline disk
4. (**optional**: spray the baking tray with water to help encourage the choux to puff up properly)
5. Bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes depending on the size of the choux mounds
6. **DO NOT** open the oven for the first 25 minutes of the baking process of the steam will release and the choux won't puff up properly
7. After about 25 minutes, open the oven and prick each choux with a toothpick and then return to the oven to cook for another 5-10 minutes depending on the choux size (this helps to dry out the insides to maintain a firm choux)
8. Remove from oven once the choux is nice and golden brown and prick each choux again with a toothpick to allow them to dry out even further while they rest
9. Remove the pastry cream from the fridge and line a piping bag (or ziplock bag) with it
10. Cut a little hole from the bottom of each choux pastry and fill the cream puffs with the ube pastry cream

### Equipment

* Saucepan
* Sheet pan
* Skillet

### Ingredients

#### Quinoa:

* 1 cup quinoa
* 2 cups water
* 1 lemon juiced
* 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Charred Plums and Golden Beets:

* 6 small golden beets trimmed, scrubbed, and quartered
* 6 plums halved, pits removed
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper trimmed and sliced into rounds
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* Flaky sea salt

#### Steak:

* 2 12-ounce ribeye steaks at least 1 thick
* 1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil
* 1 tablespoon butter
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### For Serving (Optional):

* Shaved ricotta salata or crumbled goat cheese
* Extra virgin olive oil

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Oven:

* Preheat oven to 450ºF. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.

#### Cook the Quinoa:

* Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan. Add the quinoa and cook, uncovered, until all the water is absorbed, about 15-20 minutes. Turn off the heat and cover for 5-7 minutes or until the quinoa is very tender.

#### Dress the Quinoa:

* Stir in the lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.

#### Roast the Beets:

* While the quinoa is cooking, roast the golden beets. Arrange the beets, cut-side down, on the prepared baking sheet and toss with extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper. Transfer to the oven for 25-30 minutes until almost completely tender.

#### Roast the Plums:

* Add the plums and sliced Fresno chili pepper to the baking sheet with beets, cut-side up, and continue baking for 10 minutes.

#### Char the Vegetables:

* After the plums and beets are very tender, turn on the broiler and broil until the tops of the plums become charred. Turn the broiler off and turn the oven back to 450ºF. Transfer the beets and plums to a plate and keep warm.

#### Sear the Steak:

* Pat the steaks dry once more and season all over with salt and pepper. In an ovenproof skillet large enough for both steaks, heat the oil over very high heat until very hot. Add the butter. Once melted and frothy, add the steaks to the skillet and cook without moving for 3-5 minutes per side until very well-browned.
* Transfer the skillet to the oven for 4-5 minutes more until desired internal temperature is reached. Remove from the oven and transfer the steaks to a cutting board to rest for 5 minutes before slicing or cutting the steak into cubes.

#### Assemble the Salad:

* While the steak is resting, assemble the salad. Divide the quinoa between shallow bowls and arrange the plums and beets on top. Garnish with shaved ricotta salata or crumbled goat cheese. Pile the steak on top and drizzle with a touch of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkling of flaky sea salt, if desired. Enjoy!

2020-08-23,43,"Handmade No-Knead Ultra Fluffy Buttery Milk Loaf","cookingwithRobin","This no-knead ultra fluffy handmade milk loaf kinda tastes like French brioche because I added the butter sauce with condensed milk.

**Ingredients:**

Dough:

\- 350g all purpose flour

\- 15g sugar - 2g salt

\- 75ml boiling water

\- 120ml warm milk (\~90°F)

\- 3g yeast

\- 2 eggs

\- 2 tbsps melted butter

&amp;#x200B;

Butter sauce:

\- 2 tbsps room temperature butter

\- 2 tbsp sweetened condensed milk

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/zWwz1oyRC44)

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk. Mix salt, sugar, flour and boiling water in a bowl, then add the warm milk and eggs. Mix well. Cover the bowl and rest for 20 minutes.
2. Add melted butter, stretch the dough to absorb the butter. This step took me 4 minutes. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise in a warm place until it expands to twice the size.
3. Make the butter sauce by mixing room temperature butter and sweetened condensed milk.
4. After the dough rise, remove the air inside until the size of the dough is almost the same as before the rise. Divide the dough into three pieces.
5. Roll the dough out and brush on the butter sauce. Roll it up and put it into the bread loaf pan. Cover with a plastic wrapper and final proof for 30-40 minutes.
6. Brush on a thin layer of the egg wash. Bake for 30 min in 375°F.

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. The boiling water can make the dough absorb more liquid which leads to softer texture of the bread. It is inspired by the Tangzhong (or Water roux) method.
2. Feel free to add more butter in the butter sauce to make the bread taste more like French brioche.
3. I used an aluminum foil sheet to cover the bread after it was in the oven for 18 minutes, so the color wouldn't be too dark.",1793

You need to do some prepping at the beginning, but then you can just pop it in the oven and forget about it.

Check the pictures and steps at: https://www.instagram.com/p/CEOhDhgpudQ/?igshid=1smuax8hx6gix

**Ingredients**

- ~1.5 kg of Oxtail 
- Veg: 4-5 carrots, 2 onions, 2 leeks, garlic
- Herbs: rosemary, thyme, whatever you fancy
- 1-2 glasses of red wine or a pint of Guinness
- Stock (whichever you prefer / have) or water
- 1-2 tablespoon plain flour
- Olive oil, salt and pepper

**Steps**

1. Either sear the oxtail pieces in a pan with some oil, or pop them under the oven grill. The goal is to sear the meat and get it brown (not cooked through). 

2. In the meantime, cook the veg in olive oil in a Dutch oven (or something that can go in the oven) until golden brown. Add the herbs.

3. Add 1-2 tablespoons of flour and lightly cook (this will thicken the sauce later on). Deglaze the bottom of the pan with wine or the pint of Guinness. 

4. Add the oxtail pieces to the pan /Dutch oven and pour the stock until it covers most of the meat. Bring everything to a boil, cover with the lid and pot it in the oven at low temperature (~150°C, no fan) for at least 3-4 hours. 

5. Check it every now and then. If too much liquid evaporated, add some extra stock/water. If it's still too liquidy, take the lid off to enhance evaporation. 

6. Once the meat is soft and fall-off-the-bone tender the dish is ready. You can blend the sauce and cook it down until thick and glossy.",1531

**Matcha Chocolate Ganache** (make this first!)

1. Pour the heavy cream and matcha powder into a small saucepot and whisk until combined
2. Heat over medium heat until just boiling
3. Pour the white chocolate into a heat proof bowl
4. Pour the hot heavy cream directly over the white chocolate and let the heavy cream sit over the chocolate, undisturbed, for about 3 minutes
5. Then whisk the heavy cream and chocolate together until all of the white chocolate is completely melted (you don't want to overwork the ganache)
6. Cover the bowl and then place the ganache in the fridge to cool until thickened (overnight will be best, but if you don't mind a more liquid ganache then leaving it in for only a couple hours is alright as well)

**Black Sesame Graham Crackers**

1. In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients (whole wheat flour, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt)
2. Then work the cubed, softened butter into the dry ingredients until you get a mixture that slightly resembles the texture of course breadcrumbs
3. In a small bowl, mix together the wet ingredients (milk, black sesame paste, (and optionally honey))
4. Add the wet ingredients from the small bowl, into the dry ingredients in the large bowl and knead them together until the dough forms
5. The graham cracker dough should be just slightly soft and sticky. If it is not and is instead dry and crumbly, then add in milk, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough forms together nicely
6. Chill the dough in the fridge for about an hour
7. Preheat the oven to 350F
8. Take the dough out of the fridge, lightly flour your workspace and rolling pin, and then roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thickness, into a 9in by 14 in rectangle
9. Place the dough onto a baking tray and then lightly cut the dough into rectangles (the cut does not have to go all the way through and separate the graham crackers from one another, its only a light impression to make it easier to break apart later)
10. Then take a fork and poke some holes over the top of each graham cracker
11. Bake the graham crackers for about 12-15 minutes (halfway through, take the graham crackers out to rotate the tray, and to again, lightly cut into rectangular pieces)
12. Remove them from the oven and allow to cool in the pan

**Mochi**

1. Pour the mochiko and sugar into a microwave safe bowl and mix together
2. Pour the water into the same bowl and combine well, ensuring that all of the flour has been fully incorporated and mixed in with the water
3. Cover the bowl and plastic wrap and microwave on high for 1 minute
4. Remove from the microwave, wet a spatula with cold water, and lightly mix the mochi together
5. Then cover the bowl and plastic wrap and microwave on high for 1 minute again
6. Remove from the microwave, wet a spatula with cold water, and lightly mix the mochi together
7. Cover the bowl and plastic wrap and microwave on high for 1 minute again
8. Remove from the microwave, wet a spatula with cold water, and lightly mix the mochi together
9. Take a glass container and pour half the kinako into it
10. Pour the hot mochi over the kinako and wait a couple minutes to allow for it to slightly cool
11. Then top the mochi with more kinako and shape and form the mochi into a square
12. Cut the mochi into cubes and roll in the kinako powder, ensuring that all of the sticky edges are covered

**Assembly**

1. Take a black sesame graham crackers
2. Pour a dollop of the matcha ganache over the graham cracker
3. Place a piece of mochi on top of the ganache
4. (Optionally top with more of the matcha ganache)
5. Then put another black sesame graham cracker on top

Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large saucepan

IngredientsSpicy Shrimp:

* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 shallot peeled and thinly sliced
* 5 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 4 Roma tomatoes cored and roughly chopped
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes
* 2 tablespoons butter optional
* ¾ cup dry white wine
* 2-3 cups chicken or vegetable stock plus more, as needed
* 1/2 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper more or less to taste
* 2 pounds large shrimp peeled and deveined (half chopped, half left whole)
* Salt and pepper to taste

Risotto:

* 4 tablespoons butter
* 2 cups carnaroli rice or arborio rice (cooking instructions may vary)
* 6 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* Salt to taste

For Serving (Optional):

* Dry or fresh minced parsley
* A drizzle of extra virgin olive oil

InstructionsStart the Spicy Shrimp:

* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 3-4 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.

Cook the Tomatoes:

* Add the chopped tomatoes and the cherry tomatoes and cook for 3-4 minutes more. Melt the butter into the pot. Once frothy, add the white wine and bring to a boil for 5 minutes to allow the wine to reduce slightly.

Simmer the Broth:

* Add the stock, starting with 2 cups. Season everything in the pot with salt, pepper, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes. Adding more stock, as necessary, if too much cooks off. There should be enough broth to coat about 1/4'' of the bottom of the pan, but it should not be soupy.

Cook the Risotto:

* First, warm the chicken stock (either in a small saucepan on the stove or in a large glass measuring cup in the microwave).
* Melt the butter into the large sauce pan over medium heat. Once melted, add the rice and cook, stirring regularly, until it begins to toast and turn golden brown, about 4-5 minutes.
* Ladle 1-2 cups of the broth into the rice and stir regularly. Once the liquid is mostly absorbed (do not let the rice stick), add another 1-2 cups. Continue adding ladles of stock until all of the stock is mostly absorbed and the rice is tender but not mushy, about 16-20 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest for 5 minutes. Season with salt.

Cook the Shrimp:

* As the risotto finishes cooking, add the shrimp the broth and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-7 minutes until opaque and cooked through. Do not overcook. Turn off the heat and keep warm. Taste and season again to your preferences.

To Serve:

* Add a few ladles of the spicy shrimp to the pot of risotto and stir gently to incorporate. Divide the risotto between plates and pile more spicy shrimp on top. Garnish with parsley and extra virgin olive oil, if desired. Enjoy!
