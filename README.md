# Recipies

First dataset is Reddit Recipes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michau96/recipes-from-reddit)
I'm just playing with some AI tools to parse the data.

## Tech
- Typescript
- Postgres
- Vercel AI

## Ideas

### Extract
- category
- ingredients
- relative amounts
- description

### Recommender
- how to train and use models
    - ingredients
    - nutrition
    - variety
    - cost
        - grocery prices
        - sales of the week

- feedback loop
    - family preferences
    - rating after meal

- cooking skill level required
    - how many times have I cooked this before

## Workflows

### Get raw recipe data from Reddit
- Poll for new posts
- Download data to "raw" s3 bucket (or local storage)

### Transform
